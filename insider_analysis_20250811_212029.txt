==================================================

Based on the provided SEC Form 4 filings for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for the period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, here is a comprehensive analysis of the insider trading activity.

### **Executive Summary**

Based on a review of the nine provided Form 4 filings, there were **no open-market buy or sell transactions** reported by Johnson & Johnson executives and directors. All filings show zero shares transacted and a total transaction value of $0.00. Consequently, it is not possible to correlate insider sell-offs with risk-related news, as no such sell-offs occurred within this dataset.

---

### **1. Summary of Filing Activity**

A total of nine Form 4 filings from JNJ executives and directors were analyzed for the 2024 period. The key takeaway from these filings is the complete absence of trading activity.

*   **Total Buys:** 0 shares
*   **Total Sells:** 0 shares
*   **Net Activity:** Neutral (No transactions)
*   **Total Transaction Value:** $0.00

The filings were made, but the transaction tables within them are empty. This indicates that the purpose of these filings was likely not to report a purchase or sale of shares on the open market. Form 4s can also be filed to report grants, awards, or other changes in beneficial ownership that are not market transactions, although the provided data does not contain details of such events.

### **2. Key Insiders Involved**

The filings were submitted by a mix of high-level executives and board members.

**Executives (Officers):**
*   **Joseph J Wolk:** Exec VP, CFO (Filing Date: 2024-05-22)
*   **Robert J Decker:** VP Corporate Controller (Filing Date: 2024-02-08)
*   **Vanessa Broadhurst:** EVP, Global Corp Affairs (Filing Date: 2024-02-08)
*   **William Hait:** Officer (Filing Date: 2024-02-08)
*   **Peter Fasolo:** Exec VP, Chief HR Officer (Filing Date: 2024-02-08)
*   **Timothy Schmid:** EVP, WW Chair, MedTech (Filing Date: 2024-02-08)

**Directors:**
*   **Marillyn A Hewson:** Director (Filing Date: 2024-12-10)
*   **Eugene A. Woods:** Director (Filing Date: 2024-12-10)
*   **Mark A Weinberger:** Director (Filing Date: 2024-12-12)

### **3. Transaction Details**

No transaction details are available because no transactions were reported in the provided filings.

*   **Table I (Non-Derivative Securities):** For all nine filings, the `TRANSACTIONS` array is empty. This table is used to report direct ownership of common stock.
*   **Table II (Derivative Securities):** For all nine filings, the `TRANSACTIONS` array is also empty. This table is used for reporting options, warrants, and other derivative instruments.

### **4. Notable Patterns or Trends**

The most significant pattern is the **lack of any open-market activity** among this group of insiders within the provided dataset.

*   **Clustered Filings:** There are two distinct clusters of filings:
    *   **February 8, 2024:** Five different corporate officers filed on the same day. This could suggest a company-wide administrative event, such as the acknowledgement of annual equity award grants, which often does not involve an immediate market transaction.
    *   **December 10-12, 2024:** Three directors filed within a three-day span. This could be related to annual reporting or board-related events.

### **5. Significant Observations**

*   **No Insider Selling or Buying:** The primary observation is that the data does not contain evidence of insiders either divesting from or increasing their stake in Johnson & Johnson through market transactions. This means there is no signal—either bullish or bearish—to be interpreted from this specific set of filings.
*   **Inability to Correlate with News:** The user's request to correlate sell-offs with risk-related news or 8-K filings cannot be fulfilled. **Since there were no sell-offs reported in the data, there is no activity to correlate.**
*   **Data Limitation Caveat:** This analysis is strictly limited to the nine Form 4 filings provided. It is possible that other filings containing transactions were made by these or other insiders during 2024 but were not included in the dataset. However, based solely on the information supplied, JNJ insiders have shown no inclination to buy or sell shares on the open market.
