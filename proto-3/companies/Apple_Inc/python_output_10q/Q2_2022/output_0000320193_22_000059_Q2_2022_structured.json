Statements (Unaudited)\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references\nto particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month\nperiods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended                        Six Months Ended\nMarch 26,        March 27,              March 26,        March 27,\n2022             2021                   2022             2021\nNumerator:\nNet income                       $              25,010    $      23,630    $            59,640    $      52,385\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares               16,278,802       16,753,476             16,335,263       16,844,298\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities                  124,514          175,681                126,041          177,125\nWeighted-average diluted                    16,403,316       16,929,157             16,461,304       17,021,423\nshares\nBasic earnings per share         $                1.54    $        1.41    $              3.65    $        3.11\nDiluted earnings per share       $                1.52    $        1.40    $              3.62    $        3.08\nApple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26,\n2022 and March 27, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                       Six Months Ended\nMarch 26,       March 27,              March 26,       March 27,\n2022            2021                   2022            2021\niPhone®(1)                         $              50,570    $     47,938    $           122,198    $    113,535\nMac®(1)                                           10,435           9,102                 21,287          17,777\niPad®(1)                                           7,646           7,807                 14,894          16,242\nWearables, Home and                                8,806           7,836                 23,507          20,807\nAccessories(1)(2)\nServices(3)                                       19,821          16,901                 39,337          32,662\nTotal net sales(4)                 $              97,278    $     89,584    $           221,223    $    201,023\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , Apple Watch ® , Beats ®\nproducts, HomePod mini ® , iPod touch ® and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare ® , cloud, digital content, payment\nand other services.

and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 26,\n2022, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\nto be recognized within 20years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of March 26, 2022 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nMarch 26,       September 25,\n2022                2021\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $     65,140    $         76,475\nInterest rate contracts                     $     20,775    $         16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $    110,758    $        126,918\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of March 26, 2022 and\nSeptember 25, 2021.\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated\nother comprehensive income/(loss) to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow\nhedges were not material in the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 9\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of March 26, 2022 and September 25, 2021\nwere as follows (in millions):\nMarch 26,       September 25,\n2022                2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $     14,943    $         15,954\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $    -19,766    $        -17,857\nThe gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged\nitem adjustments were not material in the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nThe Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of March 26, 2022\nand September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of March 26, 2022, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52% and 12%.

Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used\nherein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related\nto the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form\n10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are\nintended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 9% or $7.7 billion during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in\n2021, driven primarily by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company released the following products:\niPhone SE ® with 5G technology;\niPad Air ® , powered by the Apple M1 chip;\nAll-new Mac Studio™, powered by the Apple M1 Max or the new Apple M1 Ultra chip; and\nAll-new Apple Studio Display™.\nThe Company repurchased $22.9 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6\nbillion during the second quarter of 2022.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 14\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments\nand businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as\nwell as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and many of the Company’s retail\nstores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. Substantially all of the Company’s\nother facilities are open, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees. The Company continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local\nrules and regulations.\nAt times, certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have\nexperienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that could affect sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could\noccur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance\nis uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent,\ntrajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution\nand effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact\nof the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor\nof the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company\nwith respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that\ncertain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and\nissued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay\npending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2022 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults.
