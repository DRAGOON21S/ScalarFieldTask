Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported.

    20,294\nTotal fair value                      $  138,683\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 25,\n2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\nto be recognized within 21years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 25, 2021 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 25, 2021       September 25, 2021\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $             77,009    $              76,475\nInterest rate contracts                     $             16,875    $              16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $            176,268    $             126,918\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of December 25, 2021\nand September 25, 2021.\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and amounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not\nmaterial in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 9\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 25, 2021 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 25, 2021       September 25, 2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $             15,322    $              15,954\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $            -17,444    $             -17,857\nThe gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged\nitem adjustments were not material in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used\nherein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related\nto the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form\n10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are\nintended to be inactive textual references only.\nQuarterly Highlights\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments\nand businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as\nwell as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and certain of the Company’s retail\nstores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. The Company has reopened\nsubstantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the\nhealth and safety of employees, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities,\nsubject to local rules and regulations. At times, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical\nservice providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide.\nSimilar impacts or other disruptions could occur in the future.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 14\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance\nis uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent,\ntrajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution\nand effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact\nof the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December\n25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $47.6 billion, with $47.5 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nIn addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of\nDirectors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific\nnumber of shares. As of December 25, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company\nintends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.\nNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the\n2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.
