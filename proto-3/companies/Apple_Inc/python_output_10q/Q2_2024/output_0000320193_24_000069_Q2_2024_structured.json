Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for\nfair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of\nmanagement estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023\nspan 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\nthose fiscal years.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30,\n2024 and April 1, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                      Six Months Ended\nMarch 30,       April 1,              March 30,       April 1,\n2024           2023                   2024           2023\niPhone®                            $              45,963    $    51,334    $           115,665    $   117,109\nMac®                                               7,451          7,168                 15,231         14,903\niPad®                                              5,559          6,670                 12,582         16,066\nWearables, Home and Accessories                    7,913          8,757                 19,866         22,239\nServices                                          23,867         20,907                 46,984         41,673\nTotal net sales                    $              90,753    $    94,836    $           210,328    $   211,990\nTotal net sales include $ 3.3billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 30, 2024 that was\nincluded in deferred revenue as of December 30, 2023, $ 3.5billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended\nApril 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 , $ 5.1billion of revenue recognized in\nthe six months ended March 30, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, and $\n5.5billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30,\n2024 and April 1, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of\nnet sales.\nAs of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.6billion and $\n12.1billion, respectively.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes\nno obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to\nbe inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Air ® 13-in. and MacBook Air 15-in.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

On May 2, 2024, the Company announced the\nBoard of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $110 billion of the Company’s common\nstock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.\nOn May 2, 2024, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from\n$0.24 to $0.25 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2024. The Company\nintends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $23.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and\ndividend equivalents of $3.7 billion.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 17\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nNo. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require\nthe Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold.

Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance\ninvestigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The\nCommission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate\nand promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude\ncontracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation\nof apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. If the Commission concludes that there has been a violation, it\ncan issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales.\nAlthough any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the\nCommission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The\nCompany believes that it complies with the DMA and will continue to engage with the Commission as it conducts its\ninvestigations.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and 16 state and district attorneys general filed a\ncivil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging\nmonopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in\nviolation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their\napps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the\nCompany implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California\nDistrict Court. On March 13, 2024, Epic filed a motion with the California District Court disputing the Company’s\ncompliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction. The Company has filed an opposition to Epic’s motion. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2024 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and\nadversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors\nsince the 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 19\nIn January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari ® in the EU to comply with the DMA,\nincluding new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for\niOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and\napplication programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to\naddress the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private\nlitigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While\nthe changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses\nto EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the\naggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of\nU.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions\nrelating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company,\nthe Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business\npractices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms\nand applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\nproceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.",
