Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for\nfair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of\nmanagement estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023\nspan 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\nthose fiscal years.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29,\n2024 and July 1, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                     Nine Months Ended\nJune 29,       July 1,                June 29,       July 1,\n2024          2023                    2024          2023\niPhone®                            $              39,296    $   39,669    $            154,961    $  156,778\nMac®                                               7,009         6,840                  22,240        21,743\niPad®                                              7,162         5,791                  19,744        21,857\nWearables, Home and Accessories                    8,097         8,284                  27,963        30,523\nServices                                          24,213        21,213                  71,197        62,886\nTotal net sales                    $              85,777    $   81,797    $            296,105    $  293,787\nTotal net sales include $ 3.4billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 29, 2024 that was\nincluded in deferred revenue as of March 30, 2024, $ 3.3billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended\nJuly 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023 , $ 6.5billion of revenue recognized in the\nnine months ended June 29, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, and $ 7.0billion of\nrevenue recognized in the nine months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24,\n2022.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29,\n2024 and July 1, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of\nnet sales.\nAs of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.5billion and $\n12.1billion, respectively.

91,240\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case\nunder the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking\nstatements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to\nbe inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\niPad Air ® ;\niPad Pro ® ;\niOS 18, macOS ® Sequoia, iPadOS ® 18, watchOS ® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS ® 18.\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which\nwill be available on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices.

Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\nCompany under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern\n(1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for\napps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and\n(2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice\nscreen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4)\ninvestigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened\na third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for\nthird-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination\nthat there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the\nCompany’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court\nof the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless\na stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make\nchanges to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their\napps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company\nimplemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District\nCourt. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial\ndefenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
