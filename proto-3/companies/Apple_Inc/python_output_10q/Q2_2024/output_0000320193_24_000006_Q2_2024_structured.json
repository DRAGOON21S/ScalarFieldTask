Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for\nfair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of\nmanagement estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length\nof time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 19years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross\nmargins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency\ngains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2024 Form 10-Q | 8\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in\nproducts net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales\nwhen the related final products are sold by the Company. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 50% and 20% .

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes\nno obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to\nbe inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

          "content": "Item 1. Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s\nunfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store ® . On September 10, 2021, the District\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s\nunfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in\ntheir apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023,\nthe Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30,\n2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay\nenforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”). On January 16, 2024,\nthe Supreme Court denied both the Company’s and Epic’s petitions and the stay terminated. The Supreme Court’s\ndenial of Epic’s petition confirms the District Court’s ruling in favor of the Company with respect to all of the\nantitrust claims. Following termination of the stay, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction\nand filed a statement of compliance with the District Court. On January 31, 2024, Epic filed a notice with the\nDistrict Court indicating its intent to dispute the Company’s compliance plan.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the\nfunctionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch ® Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a\npermanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the U.S. of certain Apple Watch models that include blood\noxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”)\nprohibiting importation and sales in the U.S. of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which\nincludes Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2. The Company subsequently proposed a redesign of Apple Watch\nSeries 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) and appealed the Order. On\nJanuary 12, 2024, the CBP found that the Company’s proposed redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra\n2 falls outside the scope of the Order, permitting the Company to import and sell the models in the U.S.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2024 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and\nadversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors\nsince the 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2024 Form 10-Q | 19\nIn January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari ® in the European Union to comply\nwith the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps,\nalternative methods of distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s\noperating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Although\nthe Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it is still subject to potential\nchallenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek to require the\nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the European Union are\nintended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make further changes to its App Store business, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms\nand applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\nproceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.",
