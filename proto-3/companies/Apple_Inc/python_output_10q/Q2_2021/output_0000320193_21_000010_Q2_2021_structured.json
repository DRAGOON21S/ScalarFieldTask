(Unaudited)\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s\npresentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021 and 2020 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references\nto particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\n2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted\nto reflect the stock split.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on\ncertain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition\nmethod. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended\nDecember 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 26,       December 28,\n2020               2019\nNumerator:\nNet income                         $              28,755    $        22,236\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares                 16,935,119         17,660,160\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities                    178,569            158,257\nWeighted-average diluted shares               17,113,688         17,818,417\nBasic earnings per share           $                1.70    $          1.26\nDiluted earnings per share         $                1.68    $          1.25\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these\nundelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ®\nand certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a\nnet basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.6billion and $\n10.2billion, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 7\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and\nDecember 28, 2019 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 26,       December 28,\n2020               2019\niPhone(1)                                $              65,597    $        55,957\nMac(1)                                                   8,675              7,160\niPad(1)                                                  8,435              5,977\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)                   12,971             10,010\nServices(3)                                             15,761             12,715\nTotal net sales(4)                       $             111,439    $        91,819\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , Apple Watch ® , Beats ®\nproducts, HomePod ® , iPod touch ® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare ® , digital content and other\nservices.

three months ended December\n28, 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and\nDecember 28, 2019.\nNote 3 – Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash

The maturities of\nthe Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from oneto five years.\nThe Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential\nrisk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable\nfair values. As of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a\ncarrying value of $ 2.5billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively.\nRestricted Cash\nA reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 26, 2020\nand September 26, 2020 is as follows (in millions):\nDecember 26,       September 26,\n2020                2020\nCash and cash equivalents                $        36,010    $         38,016\nRestricted cash                                    1,709               1,773\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted    $        37,719    $         39,789\ncash\nThe Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s restricted cash was included in other non-current assets in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 9\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate\nrisk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets\nand liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including,\nbut not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nThere can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency\nrevenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted\ninventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash\nflow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with\nrevenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the\nCompany may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the\ncarrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the\nCompany may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of\nits net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or\nchanges in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of\nDecember 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions\nare expected to be recognized within 22years.\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-functional currencies.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\ninterest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may\noffset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates\nthese instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest\nrate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.\nCash Flow Hedges\nCash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in accumulated\nother comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and\nlosses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in\nthe same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of\ninventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are\nrecognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized\nin other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For\noptions designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life\nof the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-\nmonth time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified\ninto OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are\nreflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\nNet Investment Hedges\nNet investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment\nhedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on\na straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 10\nFair Value Hedges\nFair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in\nthe same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\nand recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.Amounts excluded from the effectiveness\nassessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 82million and $ 128million for the three\nmonths ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nThe Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s\naccounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation.

88,636    $          303\nThe notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume\noutstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk\namounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\noutstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on\nthen-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market\nrisk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and\ncredit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\nwith the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized\nupon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,\nwill depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company\ngenerally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when\nthe net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The\nCompany presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 26, 2020, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to\nderivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 215million. As of September 26, 2020, the\nnet cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security\narrangements was $ 875million. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets\nand other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nUnder master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the\nCompany is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\nDecember 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the\nCompany’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities of $ 3.5billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities\nof $ 684million and $ 312million, respectively.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 13\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10%\nor more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 41% of total trade\nreceivables as of December 26, 2020.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 61% and 14%. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade\nreceivables, which accounted for 57%, and 11%.\nNote 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 26, 2020\nand September 26, 2020 (in millions):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nDecember 26,       September 26,\n2020                2020\nLand and buildings                          $        18,885    $         17,952\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use                76,224              75,291\nsoftware\nLeasehold improvements                               10,384              10,283\nGross property, plant and equipment                 105,493             103,526\nAccumulated depreciation and                        -67,560             -66,760\namortization\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net    $        37,933    $         36,766\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nDecember 26,       September 26,\n2020                2020\nLong-term taxes payable                $        28,170    $         28,170\nOther non-current liabilities                   27,872              26,320\nTotal other non-current liabilities    $        56,042    $         54,490\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 14\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 26,       December 28,\n2020               2019\nInterest and dividend income         $                 747    $         1,045\nInterest expense                                      -638               -785\nOther income/(expense), net                            -64                 89\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $                  45    $           349\nNote 5 – Income Taxes\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of December 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 17.1billion, of which $\n9.0billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.6billion of\ngross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of December 26, 2020.\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and\nforeign jurisd ictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in\n2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 rem ain open in certain major foreign\njurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate\nprovision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax\naudits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a\nmanner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes\nin the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain,\nthe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next\n12 months by as mu ch as $ 4.1billion.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of December 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.9billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs\ngranted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are\nsettled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the\nCompany’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of twotimes the\nnumber of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the\nnumber of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or\nshares withheld.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 17\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended December 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L.

The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that\niPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value\nof such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 18\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. As of\nDecember 26, 2020, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations\nhaving a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.1billion.\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a\nlegal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the\nultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for\nthat reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least\na reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the\nverdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas\nDistrict Court, where a re-trial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and\nawarded damages of $ 503million, which the Company intends to appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of\nthe patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared\nthe patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 19\niOS Performance Management Cases\nVarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various\ninternational jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other\ncauses of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems,\nintroduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-\nmonetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict\nLitigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a\nsettlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which\nthe Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $\n500million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of\nthe settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee\naward. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310million to settle the claims. In addition to civil\nlitigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to\nthe performance management feature. On November 18, 2020, the Company reached a settlement with a multi-state group\nof attorneys general. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $\n113million to resolve civil, statutory claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not\ndefective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and\ndid, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to\ndisclose any material information.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s\nsales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision and has appealed.\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents\nowned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $\n506million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending.\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 20\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and\nDecember 28, 2019 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 26,       December 28,\n2020               2019\nAmericas:\nNet sales                $              46,310    $        41,367\nOperating income         $              15,785    $        13,092\nEurope:\nNet sales                $              27,306    $        23,273\nOperating income         $               9,589    $         7,719\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $              21,313    $        13,578\nOperating income         $               8,530    $         5,363\nJapan:\nNet sales                $               8,285    $         6,223\nOperating income         $               3,503    $         2,778\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $               8,225    $         7,378\nOperating income         $               2,953    $         2,731\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 26,       December 28,\n2020               2019\nSegment operating income            $              40,360    $        31,683\nResearch and development expense                   -5,163             -4,451\nOther corporate expenses, net                      -1,663             -1,663\nTotal operating income              $              33,534    $        25,569\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 21",

          "content": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26,\n2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update\nany forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used\nherein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by\nreference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual\nreferences only.\nQuarterly Highlights\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions\non travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\ndisruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response\nhave affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed\nat various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some\nof its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and\nsafety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and\nretail stores, subject to local rules and regulations.\nThe full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial\nperformance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including,\nwithout limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and\neffectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on\nthe global economy and demand for consumer products.

The Company’s total fixed lease payment\nobligation of $13.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 included future payments under leases that had commenced as of\nDecember 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as\nleases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of December 26, 2020.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build\nproduct based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of\nDecember 26, 2020, the Company expects to pay $45.8 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements,\nwhich are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to\nadvertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of December 26, 2020, the Company\nhad other purchase obligations of $7.8 billion.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of December 26, 2020, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct (the “Act”) was $29.9 billion, of which $28.1 billion was included in other non-current liabilities in the\nCompany’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company pays the deemed repatriation tax payable in\ninstallments in accordance with the Act.\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 28\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be\nmaterial.\nNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used\nin the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
