An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references\nto particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously\ndeferred, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                      Nine Months Ended\nJune 28,       June 29,                June 28,       June 29,\n2025           2024                    2025           2024\niPhone®                             $              44,582    $    39,296    $            160,561    $   154,961\nMac®                                                8,046          7,009                  24,982         22,240\niPad®                                               6,581          7,162                  21,071         19,744\nWearables, Home and Accessories                     7,404          8,097                  26,673         27,963\nServices                                           27,423         24,213                  80,408         71,197\nTotal net sales                     $              94,036    $    85,777    $            313,695    $   296,105\nPortion of total net sales that\nwas\nincluded in deferred revenue as     $               4,015    $     3,405    $              6,958    $     6,541\nof the\nbeginning of the period\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28,\n2025 and June 29, 2024, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of\nnet sales.\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 13.6billion and $\n12.8billion, respectively.

and restricted from\ngeneral use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related\nto the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the\n“State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a\nreversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.\n(3) As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $ 13.2billion held in escrow and restricted\nfrom general use.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and\nother measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”\n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking\nstatements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from\nthe results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are\nnot limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in\neach case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-\nlooking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by\nreference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual\nreferences only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS ® Tahoe 26, iPadOS ® 26, watchOS ® 26,\nvisionOS ® 26 and tvOS ® 26.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and\nindirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 13\nTariffs and Other Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”),\nincluding additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\nUnion (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal\ntariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have\nbeen announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of\nthe Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor\nmanufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors.\nTariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the\nCompany’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross\nmargin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or\nincremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement\ntariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade\nand other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in\nshifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services,\nall of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025\nand June 29, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months                                      Nine Months\nEnded                                            Ended\nJune 28,       June 29,                          June 28,       June 29,\n2025           2024    Change                    2025           2024    Change\nAmericas         $          41,198    $    37,678         9  %    $         134,161    $   125,381         7  %\nEurope                      24,014         21,884        10  %               82,329         76,404         8  %\nGreater China               15,369         14,728         4  %               49,884         51,919        -4  %\nJapan                        5,782          5,097        13  %               22,067         19,126        15  %\nRest of Asia                 7,673          6,390        20  %               25,254         23,275         9  %\nPacific\nTotal net        $          94,036    $    85,777        10  %    $         313,695    $   296,105         6  %\nsales\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in\n2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the\nCompany under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”) (the “Article 5(4) Investigation”). The\nArticle 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps\ndistributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June\n24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company\nregarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces\nmay violate the DMA (the “Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500\nmillion in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove\ntechnical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution\nchannels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23,\n2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final\ndetermination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist\norder and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to\nimpose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes\nthat it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and\nengagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition\nlaw and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from\nincluding in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing\nmechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\nstorefronts of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with\nthe 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024,\nthe Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30,\n2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the\nCompany from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting,\nconditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise\ninterfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the\nCompany’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the\nNorthern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The\nCompany will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District\nCourt’s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit Court”).\nAlthough the Company’s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed\nto consider the Company’s appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 20",
