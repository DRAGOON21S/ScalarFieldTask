The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of\nmanagement estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case\nunder the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking\nstatements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to\nbe inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:\nMacBook Pro ®\nMac mini ®\niMac ®\niPad mini ®\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and\nindirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 12\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December\n30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 28,       December 30,\n2024               2023    Change\nAmericas                $              52,648    $        50,430         4  %\nEurope                                 33,861             30,397        11  %\nGreater China                          18,513             20,819       -11  %\nJapan                                   8,987              7,767        16  %\nRest of Asia Pacific                   10,291             10,162         1  %\nTotal net sales         $             124,300    $       119,575         4  %\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to\nhigher net sales of Services and iPhone.

          "content": "Item 1. Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\nCompany under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern\n(1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for\napps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and\n(2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice\nscreen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4)\ninvestigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened\na third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for\nthird-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination\nthat there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the\nCompany’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court\nof the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless\na stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make\nchanges to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their\napps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the\nCompany implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction,\nwhich the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company\nfiled a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has\nsubstantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and\nadversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors\nsince the 2024 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and\nenvironmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive\norders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the\nCompany’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing\nchanges to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products\nand services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations,\nexecutive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and\nregulations will be interpreted and applied.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement\npriorities may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications,\nincluding health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations\nrelating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance\nwith applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents\nwill not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to\nhave violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with\nlittle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply\nwith the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative\nmethods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s\noperating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. The Company\nhas also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the\nCommission. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been\nchallenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant\nfines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to\nits business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security\nrisks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 19\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the\naggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of\nU.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions\nrelating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company,\nthe Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business\npractices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (“Google”) and other companies to offer their search services\non the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\ninvestigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In\nconnection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google’s products, services\nand business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant\nrestrictions on Google’s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for\nsearch distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be\nmaterially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation\nor changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new\nlaws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the\nCompany’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the\nCompany’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage,\npoor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.",
