However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and\nother trade measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-\nlooking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”\n“expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-\nlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ\nsignificantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such\ndifferences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by\nreference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual\nreferences only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following new or updated products:\niPhone 16e\niPad Air ®\niPad\nMacBook Air ®\nMac Studio ®\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and\nindirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 12\nTariffs and Other Trade Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”),\nincluding additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\nUnion (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal\ntariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S.\nTariffs have been announced and further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional\nsector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation\nunder Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of\nsemiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products\nthat contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their\ncomponents can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials\nand components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors,\nincluding whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration\nof these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic\nenvironment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the\nCompany’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of\noperations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended March 29, 2025\nand March 30, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months                                       Six Months\nEnded                                            Ended\nMarch 29,       March 30,                        March 29,       March 30,\n2025            2024    Change                   2025            2024    Change\nAmericas        $          40,315    $     37,273         8  %    $         92,963    $     87,703         6  %\nEurope                     24,454          24,123         1  %              58,315          54,520         7  %\nGreater                    16,002          16,372        -2  %              34,515          37,191        -7  %\nChina\nJapan                       7,298           6,262        17  %              16,285          14,029        16  %\nRest of Asia                7,290           6,723         8  %              17,581          16,885         4  %\nPacific\nTotal net       $          95,359    $     90,753         5  %    $        219,659    $    210,328         4  %\nsales\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2025 compared to the same periods in\n2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\nCompany under the EU Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concerned (1) Article 5(4) of\nthe DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users (the “Article 5(4)\nInvestigation”); and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a\nweb browser choice screen on iOS (the “Article 6(3) Investigation”). On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced\nthat it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual\nrequirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the “Article 6(4)\nInvestigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation\nand issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that\nprevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company\nplans to appeal the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Unless a stay is granted, any order by the Commission is\neffective while an appeal is pending. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission closed the Article 6(3) Investigation\nwithout imposing a fine and issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes\na final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and\ndesist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also\nseek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\nfeedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition\nlaw and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from\nincluding in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing\nmechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\nstorefronts of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with\nthe 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024,\nthe Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30,\n2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the\nCompany from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting,\nconditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise\ninterfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the\nCompany’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the\nNorthern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The\nCompany will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, including by appealing the California\nDistrict Court’s most recent decision.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2025 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 19",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024\nForm 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 28, 2024 (the “first quarter 2025\nForm 10-Q”), in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from\ntime to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be\nmaterially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors set forth below and those disclosed in Part II, Item\n1A of the first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q , which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of\nthis Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse\neffect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant\nmajority of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily\nin China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and\nfacilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports\nor exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain.\nThe impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the\nCompany derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive\nmeasures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials\nthat go into them or affect the availability of such components and rare earths and other raw materials, and can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and\noperations, ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its\ncustomers, and increasing the prices of its products and services. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain\nin accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s business and results of operations. Trade and other international disputes can also\nhave an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer\nspending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further\nadversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little\nor no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or\nall adverse impacts from such measures. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced,\nincluding additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among\nothers. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from\nthe U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced\nand further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or\nother measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of\nthe Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor\nmanufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors.\nThe ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or\nincremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement\ntariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. If\ndisputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global\nclimate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or\nwith more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to\nthe risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents,\nterrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated\nand geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its\ncustomers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns\nand outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 20\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and\ndelays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage\nfor certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other\ntrade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the introduction\nof new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or a change in or failure of one or more of the Company’s\nlogistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\nVaried stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities,\nincreased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nVarious stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing\nexpectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company’s business. The Company makes\nstatements about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its business, through various non-\nfinancial reports, information provided on the Company’s website, and in press statements and other communications.\nThe Company also pursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties,\nrequire investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control,\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. Efforts by the\nCompany to advance its business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align with\nstakeholders’ expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state and\ninternational laws, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse\nreactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings\nagainst the Company, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 21",
