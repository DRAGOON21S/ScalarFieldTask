consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod’s presentation.

114,095\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 31,\n2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24,\n2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,       September 24,\n2022                2022\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $        66,054    $        102,670\nInterest rate contracts                     $        20,125    $         20,125\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $       134,971    $        185,381\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows\n(in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of                    Fair Value of            Total\nDerivatives Designated       Derivatives Not Designated       Fair Value\nas Accounting Hedges             as Accounting Hedges\nDerivative assets(1):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   4,317    $                       2,819    $       7,136\nDerivative liabilities(2):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   2,205    $                       2,547    $       4,752\nInterest rate contracts       $                   1,367    $                           —    $       1,367\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and\nother non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current\nliabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform.\nTo mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually\nestablished thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the\npotential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the\neffects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8billion,\nresulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24,\n2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,       September 24,\n2022                2022\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $        14,311    $         13,378\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $       -18,731    $        -18,739\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had onecustomer that represented 10% or more of\ntotal trade receivables, which accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers\naccounted for 43% and 44% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used\nherein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about\nfinancial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the\nCompany’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is\nnot incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to\nbe inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53\nand 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022\ndue to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies\ncontributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro ® powered by the Apple M2 chip,\nand a new Apple TV 4K.\nThe Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8\nbillion during the first quarter of 2023.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments\nand businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have\nexperienced, and could in the future experience, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply\nshortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the Company’s primary\niPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at\nsignificantly reduced capacity, impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and\nindirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the\nfuture materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

  43.8  %\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily\nto the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume.\nProducts gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022\ndue primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily\nto higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022\ndue primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs,\npartially offset by improved leverage.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the\n2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will\nbe subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 18\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,          December 25,\n2022                  2021\nResearch and development               $               7,709       $

        12  %                 10  %\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same\nquarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same\nquarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,          December 25,\n2022                  2021\nProvision for income taxes           $               5,625       $         6,611\nEffective tax rate                                    15.8  %               16.0  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate                       21  %                 21  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate\ndue primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and\nthe U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due\nprimarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign\nearnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash\ngenerated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash\nrequirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for\ncommercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was\npayable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December\n31, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board\nof Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum\namount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company\nintends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.\nNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the\n2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor\nof the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company\nwith respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that\ncertain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and\nissued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay\npending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business.
