Form 10-Q | 5\nApple Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in\nconjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022\nspan 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\nthose fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month\nperiods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended                        Six Months Ended\nApril 1,        March 26,               April 1,        March 26,\n2023             2022                   2023             2022\nNumerator:\nNet income                       $              24,160    $      25,010    $            54,158    $      59,640\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares               15,787,154       16,278,802             15,839,939       16,335,263\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities                   59,896          124,514                 61,445          126,041\nWeighted-average diluted                    15,847,050       16,403,316             15,901,384       16,461,304\nshares\nBasic earnings per share         $                1.53    $        1.54    $              3.42    $        3.65\nDiluted earnings per share       $                1.52    $        1.52    $              3.41    $        3.62\nApproximately 48million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per\nshare for the six months ended April 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1,\n2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                       Six Months Ended\nApril 1,       March 26,               April 1,       March 26,\n2023            2022                   2023            2022\niPhone®                            $              51,334    $     50,570    $           117,109    $    122,198\nMac®                                               7,168          10,435                 14,903          21,287\niPad®                                              6,670           7,646                 16,066          14,894\nWearables, Home and Accessories                    8,757           8,806                 22,239          23,507\nServices                                          20,907          19,821                 41,673          39,337\nTotal net sales                    $              94,836    $     97,278    $           211,990    $    221,223\nTotal net sales include $ 3.5billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2023 that was\nincluded in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, $ 3.0billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended\nMarch 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 25, 2021, $ 5.5billion of revenue recognized in\nthe six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $ 4.8billion\nof revenue recognized in the six months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\n25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1,\n2023 and March 26, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion\nof net sales.\nAs of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.5billion and $\n12.4billion, respectively.

There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April 1,\n2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19years.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022\nwere as follows (in millions):\nApril 1,       September 24,\n2023                2022\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $    51,119    $        102,670\nInterest rate contracts                     $    19,375    $         20,125\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $   111,696    $        185,381\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows\n(in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of                    Fair Value of            Total\nDerivatives Designated       Derivatives Not Designated       Fair Value\nas Accounting Hedges             as Accounting Hedges\nDerivative assets(1):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   4,317    $                       2,819    $       7,136\nDerivative liabilities(2):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   2,205    $                       2,547    $       4,752\nInterest rate contracts       $                   1,367    $                           —    $       1,367\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and\nother non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current\nliabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform.\nTo mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually\nestablished thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the\npotential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the\neffects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8billion,\nresulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022\nwere as follows (in millions):\nApril 1,       September 24,\n2023                2022\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $    14,651    $         13,378\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $   -18,249    $        -18,739\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had onecustomer that represented 10% or more of total\ntrade receivables, which accounted for 10% . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of\ntotal trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-\ntrade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\nNote 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April 1, 2023 and\nSeptember 24, 2022 (in millions):\nInventories\nApril 1,       September 24,\n2023                2022\nComponents           $     3,379    $          1,637\nFinished goods             4,103               3,309\nTotal inventories    $     7,482    $          4,946\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nApril 1,       September 24,\n2023                2022\nGross property, plant and equipment         $   113,066    $        114,457\nAccumulated depreciation and                    -69,668             -72,340\namortization\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net    $    43,398    $         42,117\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended\nApril 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended                       Six Months Ended\nApril 1,       March 26,               April 1,       March 26,\n2023            2022                   2023            2022\nInterest and dividend income       $                 918    $        700    $             1,786    $      1,350\nInterest expense                                    -930            -691                 -1,933          -1,385\nOther income/(expense), net                           76             151                   -182             -52\nTotal other income/(expense),      $                  64    $        160    $              -329    $        -87\nnet\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\nNote 5 – Income Taxes\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nCompany and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25,\n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing\nhas been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit\nfor a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\nNote 6 – Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,\nstatements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s\nbusiness and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be\nidentified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited\nto, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.
