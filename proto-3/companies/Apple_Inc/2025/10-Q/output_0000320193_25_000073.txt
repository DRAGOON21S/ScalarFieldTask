Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for
fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of
management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional
week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with
calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references
to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the
associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable
segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28,
2025 and June 29, 2024, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of
net sales.

As of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 13.6billion and $
12.8billion, respectively. As of June 28, 2025, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in
less than a year, 23% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which
generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven
valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $ 2.6billion held in escrow and restricted from
general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related
to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the
“State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a
reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.

(3) As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $ 13.2billion held in escrow and restricted
from general use. These restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related
to the State Aid Decision.

As of June 28, 2025, 82% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-
backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years.
As of June 28, 2025, 12% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between
1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and
interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons,
including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be
no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign
exchange or interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or
other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions
of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to
12months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company
designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 28, 2025, the maximum length of
time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related
foreign currency transactions is 17years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross
margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may
use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow
or fair value hedges.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of
components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in
products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales
when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had twovendors that
individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted f or 48% and 14%. A s

As of June 28, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $ 23.7billion, which
the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6years.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business
and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a
material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking
statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain
assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,
statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and
other measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from
the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are
not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in
each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-
looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references
to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the
associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included
in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
                                                                                                                   
  Available Information                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and
its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about
financial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of
shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by
reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual
references only.
                                                                                                                   
   Business Seasonality and Product Introductions                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its
fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can
significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also
impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new
inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a
newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product
introduction.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS ® Tahoe 26, iPadOS ® 26, watchOS ® 26,
visionOS ® 26 and tvOS ® 26.
                                                                                                                   
  Macroeconomic Conditions                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and
indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial
condition.

  Tariffs and Other Measures                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”),
including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European
Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal
tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have
been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs
or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors.
Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the
Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross
margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or
incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement
tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade
and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in
shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services,
all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

Research and Development

The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025
compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and
infrastructure-related costs.

Selling, General and Administrative

The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025
compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and variable
selling expenses.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate
due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax
benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate
for the first nine months of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower
effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, tax benefits
from share-based compensation, and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income
taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2024 due
primarily to the impact from foreign currency revaluations of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective
tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was lower compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to the
impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign
earnings.

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by
ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and
capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for
manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to
perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its
products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase
obligations of $44.1 billion, with $43.8 billion payable within 12 months.

State Aid Decision Tax Payable

During the first nine months of 2025, the Company released from escrow €14.2 billion, or $15.4 billion, to Ireland
in connection with the State Aid Decision, which fully settled the obligation.

Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has authorized share repurchase programs. The
programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 28, 2025, the Company’s
quarterly cash dividend was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis,
subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $21.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and
dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40):
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01,
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying
the Effective Date , which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to
disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset
amortization, as applicable, included in certain expense captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as
well as qualitatively describe remaining amounts included in those captions. ASU 2024-03 will also require the
Company to disclose both the amount and the Company’s definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU
2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method.

Income Taxes

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
(“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate
reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU
2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and
foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will
adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.

Segment Reporting

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable
Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are
significant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU
2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment
profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company
will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make
judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2024 Form 10-K describe the significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial
statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form
10-K.

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 28,
2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2025,
which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Digital Markets Act Investigations

On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the
Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”) (the “Article 5(4) Investigation”). The
Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps
distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June
24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company
regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces
may violate the DMA (the “Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500
million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove
technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution
channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23,
2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final
determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist
order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to
impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes
that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and
engagement with the Commission.

Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general
filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company
alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”
in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive
behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.
alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The
Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the
“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and
California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District
Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition
law and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from
including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing
mechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S.
storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with
the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024,
the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30,
2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the
Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting,
conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise
interfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the
Company’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the
Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The
Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District
Court’s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit Court”).
Although the Company’s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed
to consider the Company’s appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025.

Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen
in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did
not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating
results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and
operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
