The offerings\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for\nrepair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or\ntheft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game\nsubscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a\ncurated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine\nservice; and Apple TV+ ® , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a\ncashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and\nother forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business\nand that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising\nfrom its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around\nthe world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property\nrights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\nto the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and\nsupportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000\nfull-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\nof harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in\nthe Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to\nmeet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this,\nthe Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources\nthat are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative\nof the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level,\nfoster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged\nto come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge\nemployee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security\nof its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional\nhealth and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially\nadversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can\nbe materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in\nthe real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases,\nlabor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and\ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\ndisruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and\nlogistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales\nworldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact\nconsumer demand for the Company’s products and services in affected areas.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations\nand requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s\noperational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s\ncontrol, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective\npublic safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and\nservices. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s\nproducts and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to\nexecute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nindustrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially\nall of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nAsia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and\nother international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international\ntrade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For\nexample, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports\nfrom China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products\nand the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross\nmargin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for\ncustomers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely\nimpact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services\nas designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\nCompany’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts\nfurther escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies\nin the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels,\nresulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\naffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services,\neffectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the\ntransition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s\nability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for\nthe Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with\nanticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and\nservices.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant\nconcentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in\nsingle locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain\nprovisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for\nwarranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect\nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct,\nviolations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business,\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\nterms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure\nfor the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the\nCompany’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealth. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as\nanticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect\nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in\nwidespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\nintroductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a\ncommission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and\nlegal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as\nthe European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to\nlitigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business\npractices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the\nCompany charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThis could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If\nthe rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in\nscope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\ndistinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly\nskilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In\naddition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,\nreputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the\nCompany is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and\nretain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells\nits products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\nstores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of\nterrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate,\nand the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things,\npreventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious\nattacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in\npenalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\nescalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other\nsensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems\nand services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\ncustomer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and\nservices.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”\nunder the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\nCompany, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer\ncertain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital\ncontent; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption;\nimport, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering;\nforeign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling,\nand climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer\na product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also\ncreate uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may\nincrease as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and\nfinancial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will\nnot violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have\nviolated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively\nmitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations\nrelating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in\nplace that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and\nprocedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s\nproducts could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\nstatements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social\nand governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and\nother communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of\nthese goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve\nits announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may\ndisagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its\ngoals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international\nenvironmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and\nstandards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\nlegislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require\nfurther changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to\nits platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may\nin the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms\nand apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\nproceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-\nparty transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be\ninconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\npermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially\nadverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant\nlosses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\ncomponents. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\nand avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for\nincome taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be\nuncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor\nof the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company\nwith respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that\ncertain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and\nissued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay\npending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower\nthan the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate\non foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income\ndeductions and share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled\n$156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future\ninterest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was\npayable within 12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3\nbillion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\n24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and\ncontent creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8\nbillion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board\nof Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24,\n2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an\nannual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that\nwhich is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by\nfluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs\nassociated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company\nhad outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1\nbillion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate\nswaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to\neffectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate\npayments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related\nhedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\nCompany’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an\nannualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27",

Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s\npresentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\nservices.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital\ncontent sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product\nbefore transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by\nrecognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,\nwith the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government\nauthority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2022             2021             2020\nNet income                         $      99,803    $      94,680    $      57,411\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         16,215,963       16,701,272       17,352,119\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            109,856          163,647          176,095\nWeighted-average diluted shares       16,325,819       16,864,919       17,528,214\nBasic earnings per share           $        6.15    $        5.67    $        3.31\nDiluted earnings per share         $        6.11    $        5.61    $        3.28\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations.\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35\nRestricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted.\nThe Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term\nor useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from fiveto seven years.Depreciation\nand amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $ 8.7billion, $ 9.5billion and $ 9.7billion during\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment\nfor derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are\ninitially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting\nlosses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of\nthe hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized\nin OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as\naccounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative\ninstruments relate.\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain\nforeign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of\ncorporate, data center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are\ngenerally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the\nCompany’s leases cannot be readily determined.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D”),\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n2022          2021          2020\niPhone(1)                                $  205,489    $  191,973    $  137,781\nMac(1)                                       40,177        35,190        28,622\niPad(1)                                      29,292        31,862        23,724\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        41,241        38,367        30,620\nServices(3)                                  78,129        68,425        53,768\nTotal net sales(4)                       $  394,328    $  365,817    $  274,515\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod mini and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales\nprice of certain products.\n(4) Includes $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25,\n2021, $ 6.7billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020,\nand $ 5.0billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China,\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales in 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.4billion and $\n11.9billion, respectively. As of September 24, 2022, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37\nNote 3 – Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and

Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24,\n2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                                2022          2021\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  102,670    $   76,475\nInterest rate contracts                     $   20,125    $   16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  185,381    $  126,918\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows\n(in millions):\n2022\nFair Value of                    Fair Value of\nDerivatives Designated       Derivatives Not Designated            Total\nDerivative assets(1):              as Accounting Hedges             as Accounting Hedges       Fair Value\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   4,317    $                       2,819    $       7,136\nDerivative liabilities(2):\nForeign exchange contracts    $                   2,205    $                       2,547    $       4,752\nInterest rate contracts       $                   1,367    $                           —    $       1,367\n(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and\nother non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current\nliabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform.\nTo mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually\nestablished thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the\npotential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the\neffects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8billion,\nresulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25,\n2021 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2022          2021\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $   13,378    $   15,954\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -18,739    $  -17,857\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had onecustomer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,\nwhich accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of\nSeptember 25, 2021, the Company had threevendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-\ntrade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form

Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major\nforeign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of\nexaminations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.8billion.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”).

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8billion, of which $8.0billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for\nDescription of the Matter    uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the\ninterpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25,\n2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated\nOctober 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52",

          "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53",
