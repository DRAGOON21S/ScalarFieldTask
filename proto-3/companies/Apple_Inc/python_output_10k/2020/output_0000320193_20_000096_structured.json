The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2020, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include\nprice, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and\nservice quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets\nand other electronic devices and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\nhardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors\nhave broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has\nbeen particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain\ncompetitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or\neven at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use\nillegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition in these\nmarkets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within\ntheir products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently\noffer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks,\ntrade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the\nCompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that\nits success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and\ndesign, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company\nalso holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nEmployees\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other\ninformation filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-\nrelations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically\nprovides other information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations\nwebsite, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance,\ninformation on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The\ninformation contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this\nfiling.

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important\nto understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with\nPart II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors,\nwhether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which\ncould, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary\nmaterially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors,\nin whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating\nresults and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and\ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing,\nsupply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply\nshortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company’s retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and\npoints of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and\nsafety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work\nremotely.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the\nrecommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nthe Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside\nthe Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic,\nthe development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects\non: demand for the Company’s products and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels;\nthe Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and growth.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities,\nare located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global\nand regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and\nservices. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market\nvolatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or\nasset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and growth.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in\nR&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be\nable to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to\ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\nCompany’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in\nline with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs\nto meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or\ndeficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service\nintroductions and transitions.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many\nof whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-\nparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies\nfor users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same\namounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with\nnew carriers.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered\ninto agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to\nextend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry,\nfurther limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable\nterms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and\nregional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and growth, ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore,\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially\nadversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing\npartner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be\nmaterially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to\nidentify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or\nquantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company\ngenerally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product\ndefects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to\nadhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to,\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions,\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and\nperformance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to\nproduct liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant\nand equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs\nand regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products\nand services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost\nsales.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third\nparties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for\nthe Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or\ndistributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be\nunable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage\nrules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content\navailable, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact\non the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt\nlegislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the\nprotection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s\ncontent providers.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the\nmarket position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future\ngrowth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices may suffer.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications\nmight not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly\nand may result in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast\nmajority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only\nretains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers\npurchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the\nCompany’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company\nearns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is\nreduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties,\nwhich requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries\nin which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the\nrapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing\npatents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be\ninfringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry\npractice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or\nto use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results.\nThe Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal\nproceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s\ncost of sales and operating expenses.\nExcept as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note\n10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not\nat least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to\ninfringement of intellectual property rights.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary\ndamages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company,\nand could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\nproducts and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating\nresults.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but\nnot limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\nbilling and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms;\nInternet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability\nof third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade;\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and\ninvestment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the\nCompany’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers,\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products\nand services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees,\ncontractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the\nCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nreputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For\nexample, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted,\nlegislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company’s\nbusiness, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company’s\nability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company’s business relationships with other\ntechnology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults. Further, the Company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against\nthem, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will\nnot be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations,\nlitigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an\nadverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to:\nmanage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail\npartners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases\nin quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be\nsuccessful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural\ndisasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures\nmay be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by,\namong other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or\nimpeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally\nidentifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and\noperational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things,\npersonally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company\ndevotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other\nsecurity measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security,\nand losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such\nmeasures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information\noccur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems\nthat compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident\ncould, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and\nservices, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to\nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its\nhigh profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication\ntechnologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be\nvulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\nirregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names,\npasswords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information\ntechnology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in\nthe delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject\nto specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional\nprivacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply\nwith these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or\nfines.\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could\nbe liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails\nto follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase\nin payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\nindustry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may\nrestrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed\nlaws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to\ndevelop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\ninternational requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided\non its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with\nother federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in\nproceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties\ncould include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\nits Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the\ntechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial\naccidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in\ninternational trade. International trade disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that\nrestrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the\nU.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as\nother business restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\nmaterials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns\non its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the\nCompany’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations\nand supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and\nstop offering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new\nor changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and\ndistracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding\ninternational trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes,\npublic health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\ncontrol. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with\nmore intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the\nCompany could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose\nsignificant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many\ncritical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to\nthe Company.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\nand could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for\nconsumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in\nthe Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current\nproducts and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and\nthe introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These\nand other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme\nstock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\ncompanies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock\nprice should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price\nshould reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current\nshare repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number\nof shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\nrepurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market\nand economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result,\nthe value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may\nfluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\nresellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by\ncollateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of\nthe Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The\nCompany’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international\nmarkets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade\nreceivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-\nassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated\nwith long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to\ncredit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no\nassurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation\nor exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various\njurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes\nin the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in\nthe U.S. and Ireland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected.",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and\n2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year\ncomparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nCOVID-19 Update\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary\nclosures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice.\nDuring 2020, aspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the\nvast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and the\nmajority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety\nof employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail\nstores, subject to local rules and regulations.\nThe full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial\nperformance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including,\nwithout limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability\nof effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the\npandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under\nthe heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with\ncommercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\nneeds, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements\nassociated with its existing operations.\nFiscal 2020 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of\nServices and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net\nsales during 2020.\nIn April 2020, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $175\nbillion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020.\nDuring 2020, the Company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\nof $14.1 billion.\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\n2020.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a\ndifferent Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be\nsubject to volatility and remain under downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2020       Change            2019       Change            2018\nResearch and development               $  18,752           16  %    $  16,217           14  %    $  14,236\nPercentage of total net sales                  7  %                         6  %                         5  %\nSelling, general and administrative    $  19,916            9  %    $  18,245            9  %    $  16,705\nPercentage of total net sales                  7  %                         7  %                         6  %\nTotal operating expenses               $  38,668           12  %    $  34,462           11  %    $  30,941\nPercentage of total net sales                 14  %                        13  %                        12  %\nResearch and Development\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nThe Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive\nposition in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to\nthe Company’s core business strategy.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases\nin headcount-related expenses, higher spending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n2020    Change            2019    Change            2018\nInterest and dividend income         $   3,763                 $   4,961                 $   5,686\nInterest expense                        -2,873                    -3,576                    -3,240\nOther income/(expense), net                -87                       422                      -441\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     803       -56  %    $   1,807       -10  %    $   2,005\nThe year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2020 was due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain\nactivity on non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense.

Management believes it is more likely\nthan not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\nstrategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover\nthe net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any,\nby assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”),\nwhich modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt\nASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.

Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”\nThe Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally\nrequires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nDuring 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a result of $57.4 billion of net income,\nnon-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and\nliabilities of $5.7 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of\ncash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of\ncash acquired, of $1.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities,\nnet of purchases, of $5.5 billion.

Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during\n2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5\nbillion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in\nfinancing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of\n$66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt\nof $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the\nissuance of term debt of $7.0 billion.\nDebt\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $5.0 billion of Commercial\nPaper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months.\nThe Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the\nsecurities at a specified time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\naggregate principal amount of $106.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”).

The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not\nexceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table\nincludes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on\nthe Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of\nSeptember 26, 2020. Further information regarding the Company’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.”\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build\nproduct based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including\nproduct tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising,\nlicensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 26, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the\ndeemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included\nin the above contractual obligations table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may\ndiffer from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\nManagement believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue\nrecognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation\nfees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical\nbecause they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and\nthey require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior\nmanagement has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the\nsale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the\nsubstantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of\nsale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which\ninclude iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations,\nthe allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related\nbundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nThe Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors\nthat may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should\nfuture facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-\nrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could\nchange. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified\nsoftware upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nValuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\nThe Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and\nprepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of\ninventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders\nthat have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans\nand demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and\nassessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial\ndecline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product\ndevelopment plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the\nCompany may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase\ncommitment cancellation fees.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to\nrepair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the\nCompany’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue\nis recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and\nknowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or\nrepair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest\nbenefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax\nliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and\ncomplex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could\nhave a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the\nCompany is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably\nestimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the\nheading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company\nmay have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company\nin a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income\nand expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those\nsecurities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28\nAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with\nvarying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding\nterm debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by\nthe corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest\nrates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to\nincrease by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures.\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 29",

Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the\nopinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are\nnormal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results\ncould differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s\nfiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September\nand the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\n2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted\nto reflect the stock split.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the\n“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs\nissued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies\nlease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities\nfor operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases\nstandard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented\nwere not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether\nany are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company\nrecorded $ 7.5billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nHedging\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging\n(Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands\ncomponent and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the\nseparate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to\nhedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the\nCompany recorded a $ 136million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a\ncorresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2020             2019             2018\nNet income                         $      57,411    $      55,256    $      59,531\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         17,352,119       18,471,336       19,821,510\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            176,095          124,315          178,925\nWeighted-average diluted shares       17,528,214       18,595,651       20,000,435\nBasic earnings per share           $        3.31    $        2.99    $        3.00\nDiluted earnings per share         $        3.28    $        2.97    $        2.98\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities.Potentially dilutive securities representing 62million shares of common stock were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair\nvalue with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and\nthe shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\nthreeto seven years.Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.7billion, $ 11.3billion\nand $ 9.3billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNon-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to\naccounts payable and other current liabilities of $( 2.9) billion and $ 3.4billion during 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 37\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair\nvalues. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are\nadjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of\nthe same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally\nrestricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines\ncurrent or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports\nrestricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nbased on the classification of the underlying securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis,\nfuture unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates\nrevenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on\nthe Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when\ncontrol has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to\nthe product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these\nundelivered services.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store\nand certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a\nnet basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 10.2billion and $\n8.1billion, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\n2020          2019          2018\niPhone(1)

the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services.\nServices net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple\nTV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n(4) Includes $ 5.0billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that

Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of\nthe Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from oneto five years.\nThe Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential\nrisk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the\nCompany reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its\ncost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether\nit will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-\ntemporarily impaired.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nThe Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable\nfair values. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a\ncarrying value of $ 2.8billion and $ 2.9billion, respectively.\nRestricted Cash\nA reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 26, 2020 and September\n28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):\n2020         2019\nCash and cash equivalents                $  38,016    $  48,844\nRestricted cash included in other               36           23\ncurrent assets\nRestricted cash included in other            1,737        1,357\nnon-current assets\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted    $  39,789    $  50,224\ncash\nThe Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate\nrisk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets\nand liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including,\nbut not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nThere can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency\nrevenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted\ninventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash\nflow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with\nrevenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the\nCompany may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the\ncarrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the\nCompany may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of\nits net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\ninstruments as net investment hedges.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or\nchanges in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions\nare expected to be recognized within 22years.\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 41\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\ninterest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may\noffset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates\nthese instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest\nrate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.\nCash Flow Hedges\nCash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the\nhedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign\ncurrency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is\nrecognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a\ncomponent of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses\nassociated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the\nrelated income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge\nrelates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\nforecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-\nmonth time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified\ninto OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are\nreflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\nNet Investment Hedges\nNet investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment\nhedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on\na straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nFair Value Hedges\nFair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in\nthe same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as\nfair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.Amounts excluded from the effectiveness\nassessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 465million and $ 777million for 2020 and\n2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in OCI.\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\nfinancial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nThe Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting\ntreatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the\nCompany’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):\n2020\nFair Value of                    Fair Value

Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk\namounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\noutstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on\nthen-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market\nrisk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and\ncredit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\nwith the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized\nupon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,\nwill depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44\nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company\ngenerally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when\nthe net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The\nCompany presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company\nrelated to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 875million and $ 1.6billion,\nrespectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current\nliabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\nUnder master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the\nCompany is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the\nCompany’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities of $ 2.8billion and $ 2.7billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities\nof $ 312million and $ 407million, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10%\nor more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 28, 2019.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57% and 11%. As of\nSeptember 28, 2019, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade\nreceivables, which accounted for 59% and 14%.\nNote 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 2020 and\nSeptember 28, 2019 (in millions):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n2020          2019\nLand and buildings                          $   17,952    $   17,085\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use           75,291        69,797\nsoftware\nLeasehold improvements                          10,283         9,075\nGross property, plant and equipment            103,526        95,957\nAccumulated depreciation and                   -66,760       -58,579\namortization\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net    $   36,766    $   37,378\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n2020         2019\nLong-term taxes payable                $  28,170    $  29,545\nOther non-current liabilities             26,320       20,958\nTotal other non-current liabilities    $  54,490    $  50,503\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 45\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n2020         2019         2018\nInterest and dividend income         $   3,763    $   4,961    $   5,686\nInterest expense                        -2,873       -3,576       -3,240\nOther income/(expense), net                -87          422         -441\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     803    $   1,807    $   2,005\nNote 5 – Income Taxes\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax\nlaw. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1,\n2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through\n2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign\njurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate\nprovision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax\naudits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a\nmanner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes\nin the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain,\nthe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next\n12 months by as much as $ 3.9billion.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47\nInterest and Penalties\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.As\nof September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $\n1.4billion and $ 1.3billion, respectively.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.9billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The 2014 Plan\nprovides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of\nRSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus\nawards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are\nsettled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014\nPlan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs\ngranted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares\navailable for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or shares\nwithheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle\nholders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same\nvesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the\nunderlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54billion shares plus the number of\nshares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under\nthe 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020,\napproximately 808million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i)\npermits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides\nfor automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic\nannual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to\nprospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award\ngrants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these\ngrants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval.\nRSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of\ntwotimes the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the\ncorresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26,\n2020, approximately 4million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L.

An employee’s\npayroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not\npurchase more than $ 25,000of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 107million\nshares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under\nthe 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual\ncontribution limit ($ 19,500for calendar year 2020).

The majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled\nsuch that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable\nincome and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 56million, 59million and 64million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice.

The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value\nof such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 53\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and\ncontent creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in\nexcess of one year as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\n2021          $  3,476\n2022             2,885\n2023             1,700\n2024               357\n2025               104\nThereafter         130\nTotal         $  8,652\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal\nmatters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have\nincurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for\nasserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded\ndamages of $ 503million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,\nwhich remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled\nfor a re-trial in October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at\nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further\nappeal by VirnetX.\niOS Performance Management Cases\nVarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various\ninternational jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other\ncauses of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems,\nintroduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-\nmonetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict\nLitigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a\nsettlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which\nthe Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $\n500million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of\nthe settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee\naward. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310million to settle the claims. In addition to civil\nlitigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to\nthe performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the\nperformance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve\ncustomers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any\nmaterial information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s\nsales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents\nowned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $\n506million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending.\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs\nexcluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges\nand other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes.\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2020          2019          2018\nNet sales                $  124,556    $  116,914    $  112,093\nOperating income         $   37,722    $   35,099    $   34,864\nEurope:\nNet sales                $   68,640    $   60,288    $   62,420\nOperating income         $   22,170    $   19,195    $   19,955\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   40,308    $   43,678    $   51,942\nOperating income         $   15,261    $   16,232    $   19,742\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   21,418    $   21,506    $   21,733\nOperating income         $    9,279    $    9,369    $    9,500\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   19,593    $   17,788    $   17,407\nOperating income         $    6,808    $    6,055    $    6,181\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 55\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020,\n2019 and 2018 is as follows (in millions):\n2020          2019          2018\nSegment operating income            $   91,240    $   85,950    $   90,242\nResearch and development expense       -18,752       -16,217       -14,236\nOther corporate expenses, net           -6,200        -5,803        -5,108\nTotal operating income              $   66,288    $   63,930    $   70,898\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020,\n2019 and 2018. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNet sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and long-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as\nfollows (in millions):\nNet sales:               2020          2019          2018\nU.S.               $  109,197    $  102,266    $   98,061\nChina(1)               40,308        43,678        51,942\nOther countries       125,010       114,230       115,592\nTotal net sales    $  274,515    $  260,174    $  265,595\nLong-lived assets:              2020         2019\nU.S.                       $  25,890    $  24,711\nChina(1)                       7,256        9,064\nOther countries                3,620        3,603\nTotal long-lived assets    $  36,766    $  37,378\n(1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Long-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling\nand manufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and related infrastructure.\nNote 12 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing\nand data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10years and generally contain\nmulti-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may\ncontain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily\nbased on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the\nCompany’s operating leases were $ 1.5billion for 2020. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the\nCompany’s leases were $ 9.3billion for 2020. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former\nlease accounting standards, was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.2billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFor 2020, the Company made $ 1.5billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities\ninvolving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 10.5billion for 2020, including the impact\nof adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 56\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as\nof September 26, 2020 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities    Financial Statement Line\nRight-of-use assets:                    Items                                     2020\nOperating leases                        Other non-current assets              $  8,570\nFinance leases                          Property, plant and equipment, net         629\nTotal right-of-use assets                                                     $  9,199\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases                        Other current liabilities             $  1,436\nOther non-current liabilities            7,745\nFinance leases                          Other current liabilities                   24\nOther non-current liabilities              637\nTotal lease liabilities                                                       $  9,842\nLease liability maturities as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating       Finance\nLeases        Leases        Total\n2021                              $      1,493    $       43    $   1,536\n2022                                     1,461            43        1,504\n2023                                     1,317            54        1,371\n2024                                     1,068            30        1,098\n2025                                       960            25          985\nThereafter                               3,845           895        4,740\nTotal undiscounted liabilities          10,144         1,090       11,234\nLess: Imputed interest                    -963          -429       -1,392\nTotal lease liabilities           $      9,181    $      661    $   9,842\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of\nSeptember 26, 2020 were 10.3years and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of\nthe Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily\ndetermined.\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 1.7billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for\ncorporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many\nstate and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax\nlaws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe  sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 29, 2020\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 60\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 29, 2020\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61",

          "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.",
