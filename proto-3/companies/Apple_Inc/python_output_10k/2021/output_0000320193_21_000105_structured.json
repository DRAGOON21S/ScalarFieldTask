The offerings\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for\nrepair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or\ntheft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game\nsubscription service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio\nstations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ SM , which offers exclusive\noriginal content. During 2021, the Company released Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a\ncashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect\ndistribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During\n2021, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 36% and 64%,\nrespectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks,\ntrade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the\nCompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that\nits success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and\ndesign, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company\nalso holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the\ndevelopment of all of its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company had approximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color,\nreligion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other\nlegally protected characteristic. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and\ndiversity.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable\nemployees to share in the Company’s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are\nmost likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees\naround the world.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in tools and resources that support employees’ individual growth and development. The Company\nalso provides classes and seminars to foster understanding and critical thinking about the Company’s culture,\norganization and values.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an\ninclusive culture, and ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse\nrepresentation at every level of the Company.\nThe Company has initiatives in place to implement its commitment to increase diverse representation, including\ncreating diverse interview panels and candidate slates, focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts, and\nexpanding diversity outreach efforts through organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented\ncommunities. The Company also offers team members access to ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support\nthroughout their career journey and helps them find community and connection through employee groups that create\nspaces for belonging, learning, and growing inclusivity, diversity and equity efforts.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leadership fosters an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop and thrive. Team members are\nencouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company regularly conducts\nsurveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks\nassociated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company\nsupports employees with general safety training and puts specific programs in place for those working in\npotentially high-hazard environments, including chemical management, laser safety, equipment and machinery safety,\nhazardous materials management and electrical safety. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19\npandemic, including providing information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and\ncase support. The Company also offers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as\ncomprehensive health coverage.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 4\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the\nCompany’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those\ndescribed below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock,\nhave been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\ndisruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well\nas the price of the Company’s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component\nsuppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply\nshortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The Company’s retail\nstores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as\nstores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and\nthe health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its\nemployees to work remotely.\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations\nand requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s\noperational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s\ncontrol, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective\npublic safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.\nAdditional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand\nfor the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the\nCompany’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and\nservices. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market\nvolatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or\nasset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products;\nand insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s\ntrade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nindustrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in\ninternational trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures\nthat restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between\nthe U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as\nwell as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\nmaterials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns\non its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the\nCompany’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations\nand supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance\nwith new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and\ndistracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies\nin the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\nand could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for\nconsumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in\nthe Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current\nproducts and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage\nthe risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s\nproducts, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand,\nand the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no\nassurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain\nprovisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for\nwarranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product\ndefect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of\nconduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business,\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\nterms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure\nfor the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the\nCompany’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component\ndefects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal\ninjury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including\nhealthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience\noutages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as\nanticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect\nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in\nwidespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\nintroductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a\ncommission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and\nlegal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as\nthe proposed European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. The Company is\nalso subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the\nCompany’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and\nto what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside\nof the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales,\nwould decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is\notherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees,\nincluding key personnel.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\nits Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the\ntechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive\nculture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it\ncould adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many\nof whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-\nparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of\nterrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate,\nand the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things,\npreventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious\nattacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company’s stock, materially\ndamage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could\nresult in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue\naccelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are\ndesigned to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders\nthe Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other\nsensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems\nand services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\ncustomer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for\nretail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\ninvestment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the\nCompany’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple\nstores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance\ncosts.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in\nthese actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s\ncost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the\nCompany’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”\nunder the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\nCompany, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer\ncertain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet,\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-\nparty software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax;\nand environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the\nCompany’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers,\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products\nand services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors\nor agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is\nfound to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not\nbe able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\nlegislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes.\nThese changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and\nmanages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may\nin the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely\naffect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from\nlicensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and\ncertain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-\nparty transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be\ninconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional\nprivacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply\nwith these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or\nfines.\nFinancial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and\nobligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated\ninvestigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card\nindustry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card\ntransaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data\nsecurity standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory\nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\nand the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.\nThese and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products\nin foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nand incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in\nforeign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant\nlosses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\nresellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by\ncollateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of\nthe Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The\nCompany’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international\nmarkets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade\nreceivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated\nwith long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to\ncredit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no\nassurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for\nincome taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount\nin excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global\nfinancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and\ncould in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as\nwell as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a\nsignificant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores\nand substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the\nhealth and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its\nfacilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s\ncomponent suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that\naffected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance\nis uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent,\ntrajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution\nand effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact\nof the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a\ndifferent Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be\nsubject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2021       Change            2020       Change            2019\nResearch and development               $  21,914           17  %    $  18,752           16  %    $  16,217\nPercentage of total net sales                  6  %                         7  %                         6  %\nSelling, general and administrative    $  21,973           10  %    $  19,916            9  %    $  18,245\nPercentage of total net sales                  6  %                         7  %                         7  %\nTotal operating expenses               $  43,887           13  %    $  38,668           12  %    $  34,462\nPercentage of total net sales                 12  %                        14  %                        13  %\nResearch and Development\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses,\nR&D-related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused\ninvestments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the\ndevelopment of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases\nin headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n2021    Change            2020    Change            2019\nInterest and dividend income         $   2,843                 $   3,763                 $   4,961\nInterest expense                        -2,645                    -2,873                    -3,576\nOther income/(expense), net                 60                       -87                       422\nTotal other income/(expense), net    $     258       -68  %    $     803       -56  %    $   1,807\nThe year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on\nmarketable securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower\ninterest expense on term debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were\nas follows (dollars in millions):\n2021           2020            2019\nProvision for income taxes           $  14,527       $  9,680       $  10,481\nEffective tax rate                        13.3  %        14.4  %         15.9  %\nStatutory federal income tax rate           21  %          21  %           21  %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a\nlower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived\nintangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income\ntax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax\nbenefits from share-based compensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from\nforeign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in\nunrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in\nresponse to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.\nDuring 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland\nand increased DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion\nincrease in the valuation allowance on the Company’s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is\nmore likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the Company’s remaining DTAs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled\n$172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12\nmonths and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\naggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.6 billion payable within 12\nmonths. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12\nmonths.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper\nprogram. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was\npayable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing\nand data center space. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion,\nwith $1.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\n25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12\nmonths. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to\nadvertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of September 25, 2021, the Company\nhad other purchase obligations of $8.3 billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 25, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “Act”) was $24.6 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months.\nIn addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of\nDirectors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an\nannual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that\nwhich is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a\nmanner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the\neffective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures\nand, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and\noutstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income\nand expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those\nsecurities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment\npolicy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based\non investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with\nvarying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding\nterm debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by\nthe corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest\nrates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to\nincrease by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect\nagainst foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12\nmonths. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess\nthe potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation\nto generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company\nestimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021,\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions\nmay differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent\nlimitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27",

Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries\n(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the\nopinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are\nnormal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results\ncould differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September\nand the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the\n“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected\ncredit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified\nretrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will\nultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net\nincome in millions and shares in thousands):\nNumerator:                                  2021             2020             2019\nNet income                         $      94,680    $      57,411    $      55,256\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares         16,701,272       17,352,119       18,471,336\noutstanding\nEffect of dilutive securities            163,647          176,095          124,315\nWeighted-average diluted shares       16,864,919       17,528,214       18,595,651\nBasic earnings per share           $        5.67    $        3.31    $        2.99\nDiluted earnings per share         $        5.61    $        3.28    $        2.97\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities.Potentially dilutive securities representing 62million shares of common stock were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-\nsale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\ninstrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and\ntheir availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair\nvalue with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40years or the remaining life of the building; between\noneand five yearsfor machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and\nthe shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\nfiveto seven years.Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.5billion, $ 9.7billion\nand $ 11.3billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable\nand other current liabilities of $ 2.9billion during 2019.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally\nrestricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines\ncurrent or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports\nrestricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nbased on the classification of the underlying securities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment\nfor derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are\ninitially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting\nlosses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair\nvalue of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as\naccounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative\ninstruments relate.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the\nCompany’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high\ncredit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company\nrecognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and\ntitle and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.\nFor most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net\nsales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\niCloud ® , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\non the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered\nhardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs\nincurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost\nof sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these\nundelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store\nand certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a\nnet basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.9billion and $\n10.2billion, respectively. As of September 25, 2021, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree years.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):\n2021          2020          2019\niPhone(1)                                $  191,973    $  137,781    $  142,381\nMac(1)                                       35,190        28,622        25,740\niPad(1)                                      31,862        23,724        21,280\nWearables, Home and Accessories(1)(2)        38,367        30,620        24,482\nServices(3)                                  68,425        53,768        46,291\nTotal net sales(4)                       $  365,817    $  274,515    $  260,174\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\nHomePod, iPod touch and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and\nother services.

recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 37\nNote 3 – Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and

Fair values were determined for each individual security in\nthe investment portfolio.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting\nfrom movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 25,\n2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\nto be recognized within 21years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect\ngross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nenter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either\ncash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 25, 2021 and September 26,\n2020 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                                2021         2020\nForeign exchange contracts                  $   76,475    $  57,410\nInterest rate contracts                     $   16,875    $  20,700\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  126,918    $  88,636\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September 25, 2021\nand September 26, 2020.\nThe gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s\nderivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 25, 2021 and September 26,\n2020 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2021          2020\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $   15,954    $   16,270\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -17,857    $  -21,033\nThe gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged\nitem adjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require\ncollateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the\nCompany attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by\nrequiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements\nare directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does\nnot assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10%\nor more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade\nreceivables as of September 25, 2021.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had threevendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-\ntrade receivables, which accounted for 57% and 11%.\nNote 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement

The Company has elected\nto record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign\nearnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had $ 2.6billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $\n1.6billion in California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward\nindefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other\ntemporary differences.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.5billion, of which $\n6.6billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.5billion, of which $ 8.8billion, if recognized, would have\nimpacted the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for\n2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in millions):\n2021         2020         2019\nBeginning balances                          $  16,475    $  15,619    $   9,694\nIncreases related to tax positions taken          816          454        5,845\nduring a prior year\nDecreases related to tax positions taken       -1,402         -791         -686\nduring a prior year\nIncreases related to tax positions taken        1,607        1,347        1,697\nduring the current year\nDecreases related to settlements with          -1,838          -85         -852\ntaxing authorities\nDecreases related to expiration of the           -181          -69          -79\nstatute of limitations\nEnding balances                             $  15,477    $  16,475    $  15,619\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and\nforeign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major\nforeign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of\nexaminations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 1.2billion.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42\nInterest and Penalties\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.As\nof September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $\n1.5billion and $ 1.4billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense of $ 219million, $\n85million and $ 73million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of\ntwosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\nappealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental\nIrish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.\ntaxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash\nEquivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\nNote 6 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing\nand data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10years and generally contain\nmultiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may\ncontain both lease and nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease\ncomponents as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily\nbased on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the\nCompany’s operating leases were $ 1.7billion and $ 1.5billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs\nassociated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 12.9billion and $ 9.3billion for 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards,\nwas $ 1.3billion in 2019.\nThe Company made $ 1.4billion and $ 1.5billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities\nwere $ 3.3billion for 2021 and $ 10.5billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as\nof September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities    Financial Statement Line\nRight-of-use assets:                    Items                                      2021        2020\nOperating leases                        Other non-current assets              $  10,087    $  8,570\nFinance leases                          Property, plant and equipment, net          861         629\nTotal right-of-use assets                                                     $  10,948    $  9,199\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases                        Other current liabilities             $   1,449    $  1,436\nOther non-current liabilities             9,506       7,745\nFinance leases                          Other current liabilities                    79          24\nOther non-current liabilities               769         637\nTotal lease liabilities                                                       $  11,803    $  9,842\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43\nLease liability maturities as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating       Finance\nLeases        Leases        Total\n2022                              $      1,629    $      104    $   1,733\n2023                                     1,560           123        1,683\n2024                                     1,499            99        1,598\n2025                                     1,251            46        1,297\n2026                                     1,061            26        1,087\nThereafter                               5,187           868        6,055\nTotal undiscounted liabilities          12,187         1,266       13,453\nLess: Imputed interest                  -1,232          -418       -1,650\nTotal lease liabilities           $     10,955    $      848    $  11,803\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 25, 2021 and\nSeptember 26, 2020 was 10.8years and 10.3years, respectively.\nThe discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020\nwas 2.0%. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the\ndiscount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had $ 1.1billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for\ncorporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.

RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan\nreduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs granted.\nRSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available\nfor grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All\nRSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the\nsame dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and\nconditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760million shares were reserved for\nfuture issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan that\nexpire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will\nalso be available for awards under the 2014 Plan.\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i)\npermits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides\nfor automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic\nannual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to\nprospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award\ngrants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these\ngrants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval.\nRSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of\ntwotimes the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the\nunderlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 4million shares were reserved for future issuance under\nthe Director Plan.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended September 25, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca\nMaestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule\n10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that preestablishes the amounts,\nprices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the\nCompany’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 46\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all\nemployees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal\nto 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-monthoffering\nperiods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation\nand employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000of stock during any calendar year. As of September 25, 2021,\napproximately 96million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under\nthe 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service annual contribution limit ($ 19,500for calendar year 2021). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each\nemployee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible\nearnings.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows:\nNumber of       Weighted-Average           Aggregate\nRSUs        Grant Date Fair          Fair Value\n(in thousands)          Value Per RSU       (in millions)\nBalance as of September 29, 2018           368,618    $             33.65\nRSUs granted                               147,409    $             53.99\nRSUs vested                               -168,350    $             33.80\nRSUs canceled                              -21,609    $             40.71\nBalance as of September 28, 2019           326,068    $             42.30\nRSUs granted                               156,800    $             59.20\nRSUs vested                               -157,743    $             40.29\nRSUs canceled                              -14,347    $             48.07\nBalance as of September 26, 2020           310,778    $             51.58\nRSUs granted                                89,363    $            116.33\nRSUs vested                               -145,766    $             50.71\nRSUs canceled                              -13,948    $             68.95\nBalance as of September 25, 2021           240,427    $             75.16    $         35,324\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 19.0billion, $ 10.8billion and $ 8.6billion for\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were net share settled\nsuch that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable\nincome and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 53million, 56million and 59million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $ 6.8billion, $ 3.9billion and\n$ 3.0billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n2021         2020         2019\nShare-based compensation expense    $   7,906    $   6,829    $   6,068\nIncome tax benefit related to       $  -4,056    $  -2,476    $  -1,967\nshare-based compensation expense\nAs of September 25, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options\nwas $ 13.6billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5years.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 47\nNote 10 – Commitments and Contingencies\nAccrued Warranty and Guarantees\nThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in\nmillions):\n2021         2020         2019\nBeginning accrued warranty and related    $   3,354    $   3,570    $   3,692\ncosts\nCost of warranty claims                      -2,674       -2,956       -3,857\nAccruals for product warranty                 2,684        2,740        3,735\nEnding accrued warranty and related       $   3,364    $   3,354    $   3,570\ncosts\nThe Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in\nthe U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that\niPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company\naccounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value\nof such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future\npayments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of\nSeptember 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):\n2022          $  4,551\n2023             2,165\n2024               984\n2025               405\n2026                51\nThereafter          28\nTotal         $  8,184\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a\nlegal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the\nultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for\nthat reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least\na reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the\nverdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas\nDistrict Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and\nawarded damages of $ 503million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the\npatents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the\npatents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.\niOS Performance Management Cases\nOn April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer\nintrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone\noperating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a\nMultidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict\nLitigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021,\nthe Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which\nwill result in an aggregate payment of $ 310million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its\niPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was\nintended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading\nstatements or fail to disclose any material information.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s\nsales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents\nowned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-\ntrial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021\nand the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of $ 300million against the Company, which the Company plans to\nappeal.\nNote 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.”\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2021, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments.

As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if\nrecognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax\nlaws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions,\nand the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to\nbe sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s\ndisclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 28, 2021\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 53\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 28, 2021\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54",

          "content": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 55",
