The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\ndirectly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a\nvariety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\nand resellers. During 2024, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted\nfor 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\nintellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors\nimitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\nthe Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research\nand development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and\ntechnology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\nhardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets\nand other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business\nand that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising\nfrom its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around\nthe world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property\nrights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\nto the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been\nable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses\ncould be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also\nimpact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new\ninventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a\nnewer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and\nretain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its\nteam members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had\napproximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in\nthe Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to\nmeet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this,\nthe Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time\naway.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers\nprograms through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values.\nTeam members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as\nlearning opportunities to support their well-being.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\nof harassment or discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of\nthe communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster\nan inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged\nto come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge\nemployee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security\nof its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the\nCompany’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit,\nhigher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial\nmarket volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline\nin, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business\noperations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the\nCompany’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse\neffect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially\nall of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs\nand other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply\nto countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\nsupply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components\nand raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing\nsuppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain\nin accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which\ncan create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs\nand other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future,\nactions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global\nclimate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or\nwith more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to\nthe risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents,\nterrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated\nand geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its\ncustomers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns\nand outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and\ndelays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or\nlimited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such\nsources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage\nfor certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\nand services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s\nintellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\naffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\nparty digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services,\neffectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the\ntransition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s\nability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services, the effective management\nof purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products\nin appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and\nservices may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or\nsupersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially\nadversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The\nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower\noperating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished\ncontrol has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.\nAlthough arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the\nCompany generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of\nproduct defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company\nrelies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur\nfrom time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor,\nenvironmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or\nconflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\ndisrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\nimpacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant\nrisks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply\nof many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\nsimilar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can\nmaterially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\nComponent defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage\nand personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time\nto time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have\nnot performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including\nexposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the\nCompany will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.\nFailure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and\nservices. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security\nof a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and\nsignificant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can\nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\nassets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\ncompetes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products,\nservices or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not\nto buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\npart on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\nsuch software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\nCompany’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can\nresult in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an\napplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions\nin response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to\nmake further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and\nSafari ® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS\nand iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional\ntools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and\nservices could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\nincluding if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the\ncommission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope\nor eliminated.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\ninto the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\ndistinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly\nskilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In\naddition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture,\nreputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the\nCompany is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and\nretain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells\nits products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\nstores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at\nall or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power\ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-\nins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and\nother continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity\nand disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can\nadversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services,\ninterfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These\nevents could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data\nsecurity, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can\ndisrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided\nto or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and\nlosses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other\nmalicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to\nattract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in\npenalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\nescalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\nprocesses.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\nsufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\ninduce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames,\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or\nsuch suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company\ndeploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in\nthe delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners;\nmanage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality\nretail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property\nrights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well\nas internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief\nand substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and\nservices.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of\nrevenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time\nrequired, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s\nability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer\na product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services,\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business\nor supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and\nregulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company\nexpands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate\nnew legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented\npolicies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with\nlittle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations\nexpose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the\nCompany’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\nstatements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations and implementation of the Company’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and\nuncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the\nCompany’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and\ngovernance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and\ninitiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives,\nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance\nlaws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and\nregulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\nand penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\nfurther business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how\ndevelopers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply\nwith the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative\nmethods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s\noperating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to\nits compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”).\nAlthough the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the\nCommission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties\nfor noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While\nthe changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA\nposes to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the\naggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of\nU.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions\nrelating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company,\nthe Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business\npractices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the\nCompany’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\ninvestigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to\nthe Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\nobligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection,\nuse, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its\ninternational subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may\nbe inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\nsignificant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\npermitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\nincluding new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially\nadverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or\nmanufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nrelative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could\nin the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\nsales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\nor incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to\noffset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange\nrates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may\nfluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\nconditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\ncomponents. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\nand avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax\nlaws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be\nsubject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,\nor if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously\naccrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels\nor grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not\nobligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future\ngrowth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock\nmay decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\nretention.",

Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\nCompany under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how\ndevelopers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as\nhow developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission\nannounced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules\nare in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company\nregarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces\nmay violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a\ncease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any\ndecision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s\norder would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\nfeedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company\nalleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones”\nin violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive\nbehavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\nalleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\n“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and\nCalifornia’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District\nCourt found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their\napps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company\nimplemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District\nCourt. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a\nmotion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has\nsubstantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did\nnot individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\nresults. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

state income\ntaxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D\ncredit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge\nof $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower\ntax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled\n$140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and

The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing\npurchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements,\nlicensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had\nother purchase obligations of $12.0 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 25\nState Aid Decision Tax Payable\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in\nconnection with the State Aid Decision, all of which was expected to be paid within 12 months. The funds necessary\nto settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the\nCompany’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual\nbasis, subject to declaration by the Board.\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly\ndividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of\nits common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nNo. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require\nthe Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the\nCompany to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further\ndisaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth\nquarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are\nsignificant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU\n2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment\nprofit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company\nwill adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating\nresults require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights\nbetween countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves.\nReserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.\nResolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various\nstrategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the\nCompany’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against\ninterest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and\nliabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the\neffects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as\nof September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate           Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument    Rate Increase                   Potential Impact                       2024        2023\nInvestment portfolio    100 basis points, all tenors    Decline in fair value              $  2,755    $  3,089\nTerm debt               100 basis points, all tenors    Increase in annual interest        $    139    $    194\nexpense\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations\nin exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect\nagainst foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local\ncurrency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign\ncurrency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the\npotential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the\nmaximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95%\nconfidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27",

Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the\nuse of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional\nweek is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\ncalendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2022\nspanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular\nyears, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards\nthat will ultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash\nequivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain\nforeign earnings created by the TCJA.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of\ncorporate, data center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or\nservices is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to\npayment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the\nCompany’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\nservices, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of\niPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the\nallocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material\nperformance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® ,\nSiri ® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations\nbased on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the\nallocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and\nbundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the\nproduct is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\nservices.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does\nnot obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all\nthird-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\nretains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024          2023          2022\niPhone                             $  201,183    $  200,583    $  205,489\nMac                                    29,984        29,357        40,177\niPad                                   26,694        28,300        29,292\nWearables, Home and Accessories        37,005        39,845        41,241\nServices(1)                            96,169        85,200        78,129\nTotal net sales                    $  391,035    $  383,285    $  394,328\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain\nproducts.\nTotal net sales include $ 7.7billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, $ 8.2billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 24, 2022, and $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 25, 2021.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\nsegment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China,\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.8billion and $\n12.1billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be\nrealized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than\nthree

The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s\nunderlying maturity.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and\ninterest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\nincluding accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\nexchange or interest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12months.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 37\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length\nof time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 18years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross\nmargins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency\ngains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\ncurrencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow\nor fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023 were as follows (in millions):\nDerivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges:                               2024          2023\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  64,069    $   74,730\nInterest rate contracts                     $  14,575    $   19,375\nDerivative instruments not designated as\naccounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts                  $  91,493    $  104,777\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023 were as follows (in millions):\nHedged assets/(liabilities):                2024          2023\nCurrent and non-current marketable    $        —    $   14,433\nsecurities\nCurrent and non-current term debt     $  -13,505    $  -18,247\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 38% and 41% of total trade receivables as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or\ncollateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company\npurchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in\nproducts net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales\nwhen the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had twovendors that\nindividually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\nrecovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion.\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount\nfor certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of € 12.7billion\nplus interest of € 1.2billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow,\nincluding net unrealized investment gains, was € 14.2billion or $ 15.8billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $\n2.6billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $ 13.2billion was classified as current marketable\nsecurities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section\nof Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 39\nThe Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On\nSeptember 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the\n“ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023.

The total shares\nwithheld were approximately 31million, 37million and 41million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were\nbased on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock\nprice.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist\nof supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments\nunder unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2024, are\nas follows (in millions):\n2025          $   3,206\n2026              2,440\n2027              1,156\n2028              3,121\n2029                633\nThereafter          670\nTotal         $  11,226\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 45\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\nand that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.\nEurope includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China\nmainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales\nfor geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail\nstores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third\nparties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information\nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment\nperformance excludes asset information.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 46\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\nAmericas:                      2024          2023          2022\nNet sales                $  167,045    $  162,560    $  169,658\nOperating income         $   67,656    $   60,508    $   62,683\nEurope:\nNet sales                $  101,328    $   94,294    $   95,118\nOperating income         $   41,790    $   36,098    $   35,233\nGreater China:\nNet sales                $   66,952    $   72,559    $   74,200\nOperating income         $   27,082    $   30,328    $   31,153\nJapan:\nNet sales                $   25,052    $   24,257    $   25,977\nOperating income         $   12,454    $   11,888    $   12,257\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales                $   30,658    $   29,615    $   29,375\nOperating income         $   13,062    $   12,066    $   11,569\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024,\n2023 and 2022 is as follows (in millions):\n2024          2023          2022\nSegment operating income            $  162,044    $  150,888    $  152,895\nResearch and development expense       -31,370       -29,915       -26,251\nOther corporate expenses, net(1)        -7,458        -6,672        -7,207\nTotal operating income              $  123,216    $  114,301    $  119,437\n(1) Includes general and administrative compensation costs, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately\nmanaged costs.\nThe following tables show net sales for 2024, 2023 and 2022 and long-lived assets as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 for countries that individually accounted for 10% or more of the respective totals, as well as\naggregate amounts for the remaining countries (in millions):\nNet sales:               2024          2023          2022\nU.S.               $  142,196    $  138,573    $  147,859\nChina(1)               66,952        72,559        74,200\nOther countries       181,887       172,153       172,269\nTotal net sales    $  391,035    $  383,285    $  394,328\nLong-lived assets:              2024         2023\nU.S.                       $  35,664    $  33,276\nChina(1)                       4,797        5,778\nOther countries                5,219        4,661\nTotal long-lived assets    $  45,680    $  43,715\n(1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 47\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28,\n2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it\nrelates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28,\n2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of\nwhich $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.\nIn accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses\nDescription of the Matter    significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex\ndomestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax\npositions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than\nnot to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions\nthat qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.\nWe evaluated the Company’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not\nto be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies\nfor recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating\nHow We Addressed the    management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company’s communications\nMatter in Our Audit     with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain\ntax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical\nmerits of certain of the Company’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax\nlaws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we\nalso received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter\nwith external advisors and the Company’s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the\nCompany’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial\nstatements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50",

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\n28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024,\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and\n15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 51",
