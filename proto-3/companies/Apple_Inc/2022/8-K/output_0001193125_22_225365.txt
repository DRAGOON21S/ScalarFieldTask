  Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;     
  Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.On August 17, 2022, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”)   
  of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Apple Inc. (“Apple”) approved the Apple Inc. Executive Cash           
  Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which eligible participants may be granted cash incentive awards based on the  
  achievement of performance goals over performance periods established by the Committee (each, an “Award”). The   
  Plan is intended to attract, retain, motivate, reward and align the efforts of Plan participants with the        
  objectives of Apple shareholders. Eligible participants are members of Apple’s executive team, including         
  Apple’s named executive officers and other employees designated by the Committee.The Plan is administered by     
  the Committee. The Committee establishes performance periods, which generally correlate to Apple’s fiscal        
  years, and performance goals for which achievement will be measured over each performance period. The Committee  
  also establishes any applicable threshold, target and maximum level of achievement for each performance goal.    
  The Committee will specify the performance period, performance goal(s), maximum payout opportunity and any       
  other terms and conditions for the Awards.The payout that a participant may receive under the Plan with respect  
  to an Award is based upon whether and to what extent the performance goals have been achieved, as determined by  
  the Committee after receiving the necessary information to evaluate such achievement after the end of the        
  performance period. The payout will be made in cash as soon as practicable after the Committee considers the     
  achievement of the performance goals, and to the extent applicable, a participant’s performance. If a            
  participant terminates service prior to a payout date, the participant’s Award will be forfeited unless          
  otherwise determined by the Committee.The foregoing description of the Plan is a summary and is qualified in     
  its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and   
  is incorporated by reference herein.Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in
