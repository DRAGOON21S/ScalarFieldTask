Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s
presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”).
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional
week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with
calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021 and 2020 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references
to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the
associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Common Stock Split
On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,
2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted
to reflect the stock split.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on
certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition
method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated
financial statements.

  Note 2 – Revenue Recognition                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company
recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is
transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and
title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers.
For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s
Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net
sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as
applicable.
The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other
customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are
distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone
selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable
prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices
of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process
for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique
facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the
Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business
objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.
The Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale
of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial
portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The
second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include
iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available
basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company
allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because
the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based
on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated
to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered
hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs
incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost
of sales as incurred.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet
delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The
Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.
Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these
undelivered services.
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the
customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers
multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to,
evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the
responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ®
and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain
control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a
net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental
authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant
government authority.
Deferred Revenue

As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.0billion and $
10.2billion, respectively. As of June 26, 2021, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in
less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

(3) As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $ 18.9billion and $
18.6billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note
5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons
including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table
shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of June
26, 2021 (in millions):

The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential
risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in
the investment portfolio.

Non-Marketable Securities

The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable
fair values. As of both June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a
carrying value of $ 2.8billion.

Restricted Cash
A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash,
cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of June 26, 2021 and
September 26, 2020 is as follows (in millions):

The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.
Substantially all of the Company’s restricted cash was included in other non-current assets in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate
risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets
and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including,
but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted
inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward
contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash
flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with
revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12months.
To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the
Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the
carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the
Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of
its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these
instruments as net investment hedges.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other
instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or
changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of
June 26, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are
expected to be recognized within 21years.
                                        Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 10                                        
The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in
non-functional currencies.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may
offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates
these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 26, 2021, the Company’s hedged interest rate
transactions are expected to be recognized within six years.

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in
the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of
inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are
recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized
in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For
options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life
of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are
recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-
month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are
reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a
part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment
hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on
a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment
of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Fair Value Hedges

Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are
recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in
the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts
designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.Amounts excluded from the effectiveness
assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 57million and $ 199million for the three-
and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively, and were gains of $ 119million and $ 373million for the
three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from
the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the
financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s
accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show
the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk
amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are
outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on
then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market
risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and
credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated
with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized
upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by
permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company
generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when
the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The
Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the net cash collateral received by the
Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 576million and $
875million, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and
other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.

Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the
Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of
June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the
Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets
and derivative liabilities of $ 2.2billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative asset of $
6million and a net derivative liability of $ 312million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government
customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require
collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the
Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by
requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements
are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does
not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of both June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had nocustomers that individually represented 10% or
more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 36% of total trade
receivables as of June 26, 2021.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of
components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 26, 2021, the Company had twovendors that
individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56% and 13%. As of
September 26, 2020, the Company had twovendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade

Uncertain Tax Positions
As of June 26, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8billion, of which $ 7.6billion,
if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.6billion of gross
interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of June 26, 2021.

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and
foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major
foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made
for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be
predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax examinations are resolved in a manner
inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the
period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the
Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12
months by as much as $ 2.4billion.

European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by
providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of
twosubsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and
recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative
changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The
recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1billion, plus interest of € 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed
the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On
July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission
appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental
Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S.
taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery
amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of June 26, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €
12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will
remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.

Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements

The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper
program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including
dividends and share repurchases. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 8.0billion and $
5.0billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The
weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.04% and 0.62% as of June 26, 2021 and
September 26, 2020, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance
and maturities of Commercial Paper for the nine months ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions):

In 2020, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to
repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement
with the marketable securities, the Company accounted for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. As of September
26, 2020, the Repos had been settled.

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company
has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or
the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign
currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency
swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or
premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 657million and $ 1.9billion of
interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively. The Company
recognized $ 664million and $ 2.1billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods
ended June 27, 2020, respectively.

As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $
120.3billion and $ 117.1billion, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

As of June 26, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 315billion of the Company’s common stock under
a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the nine months ended June 26, 2021, the Company repurchased
515million shares of its common stock for $ 65.5billion, including 32million shares initially delivered under a May
2021 accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”), bringing the total utilization under the Program to $
234.1billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the
Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans
complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Under the terms of the Company’s May 2021 ASR, a financial institution committed to deliver shares of the Company’s
common stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment of $ 5.0billion. The total number of
shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined
based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASR’s purchase period, which
will end in or before August 2021. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-
front payment is accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payment is made.

Stock Plans

The Company had 757million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of June 26, 2021. RSUs
granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are
settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the
Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of twotimes the
number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the
number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of twotimes the number of RSUs canceled or
shares withheld.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the three months ended June 26, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri,
Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under
the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates
(or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock,
including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.

nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively.

The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in
the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that
iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company
accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value
of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components
with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices.
Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at
times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
                                        Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 19                                        
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced
by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their
manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at
all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of
components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that
the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or
services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist
of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. As of June
26, 2021, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a
remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.8billion.

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business
and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a
legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the
ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for
that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least
a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded
accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:

VirnetX

VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products
infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the
verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas
District Court, where a re-trial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and
awarded damages of $ 503million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the
patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the
patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.

iOS Performance Management Cases

On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer
intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone
operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a
Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict
Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021,
the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which
will result in an aggregate payment of $ 310million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its
iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was
intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading
statements or fail to disclose any material information.

French Competition Authority

On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s
sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law and issued a fine of € 1.1billion. The
Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision and has appealed.

Optis

Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents
owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $
506million. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside, and a retrial was
scheduled for August 2021. The case remains pending further proceedings.

The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the
internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s
reportable segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America.
Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China
mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in
the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software
products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s
customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting
policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K.
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales
for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail
stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses
are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each
segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs
excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges
and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers
between segments for management reporting purposes.

This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking
statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain
assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example,

identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”
“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited
to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references

associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used
herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included
in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

  Quarterly Highlights                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its
fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can
significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also
impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new
inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a
newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product
introduction.

COVID-19 Update

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions
on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and
disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response
have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price.

During the third quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed
at various times, and a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened
substantially all of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and
the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its
offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations.

The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance
is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the
timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of
vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy
and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,”
for more information.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with
commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements
associated with its existing operations.

Products Gross Margin

due primarily to a different Products mix, the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and
improved leverage. Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage increased during the first nine months of 2021
due primarily to improved leverage, a different Products mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar.

Services Gross Margin

Services gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods
in 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales, a different Services mix and the strength in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar.

expenses and R&D-related professional services. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D
are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and
updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.

Selling, General and Administrative

OI&E increased during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to a favorable
carrying value adjustment of non-marketable securities and smaller impairments of securities, partially offset by
lower interest income. Year-over-year OI&E increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to smaller
impairments of securities, lower interest expense and favorable carrying value adjustments of non-marketable
securities, partially offset by lower interest income.

The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
was 1.32% and 1.74% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 1.40% and 1.95% in the first nine
months of 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 was lower than the statutory
federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based
compensation, and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income
taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was lower compared to the third quarter of 2020 due
primarily to the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, a higher mix of foreign earnings, and
higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2021 was lower compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from share-based
compensation, the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, and a higher mix of foreign earnings,
partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by
the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.

(1) As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $18.9 billion and $18.6
billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5,
“Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and
other agreements.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with
commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements
associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of June 26, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus
interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the
conclusion of all legal proceedings. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part I,
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”

The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the
primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally
requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.

During the nine months ended June 26, 2021, cash generated by operating activities of $83.8 billion was a result of
$74.1 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $12.8 billion and a decrease in the net change
in operating assets and liabilities of $3.1 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $15.4 billion during the
nine months ended June 26, 2021 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of
maturities and sales, of $7.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.9 billion. Cash
used in financing activities of $73.0 billion during the nine months ended June 26, 2021 consisted primarily of
cash used to repurchase common stock of $66.2 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $10.8
billion and cash used to repay or redeem term debt of $7.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance
of term debt of $13.9 billion.

During the nine months ended June 27, 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $60.1 billion was a result of
$44.7 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $13.5 billion and an increase in the net change
in operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $9.8 billion during the
nine months ended June 27, 2020 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of
maturities and sales, of $2.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $5.5 billion. Cash
used in financing activities of $65.5 billion during the nine months ended June 27, 2020 consisted primarily of
cash used to repurchase common stock of $55.2 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $10.6
billion and cash used to repay or redeem term debt of $12.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance
of term debt of $10.6 billion and proceeds from repurchase agreements of $5.2 billion.

Debt

The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper
program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes,
including dividends and share repurchases. As of June 26, 2021, the Company had $8.0 billion of Commercial Paper
outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.04% and maturities generally less than nine months.

As of June 26, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an
aggregate principal amount of $113.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During the first nine months of 2021, the
Company issued $13.9 billion and repaid or redeemed $7.5 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the
future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has
entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.

Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I,
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial
Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”

Capital Return

As of June 26, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under
a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the nine months ended June 26, 2021, the Company repurchased 515
million shares of its common stock for $65.5 billion, including 32 million shares initially delivered under a $5.0
billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) entered into in May 2021, bringing the total utilization
under the Program to $234.1 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of
shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions,
including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”).

As of June 26, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its
dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
                                                                                                                   
  Contractual Obligations                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing
and data center space. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not
exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The Company’s total fixed lease payment
obligation of $13.7 billion as of June 26, 2021 included future payments under leases that had commenced as of June
26, 2021, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that
had been signed but not yet commenced as of June 26, 2021.

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to
perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build
product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The
Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June
26, 2021, the Company expects to pay $38.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are
primarily noncancelable.

Other Purchase Obligations

The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,
including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to
advertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of June 26, 2021, the Company had
other purchase obligations of $9.1 billion.
Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable
As of June 26, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(the “Act”) was $24.9 billion, all of which was included in other non-current liabilities in the Company’s
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company pays the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in
accordance with the Act.
Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to
make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments.
                                                                                                                   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results
require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be
material.

Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used
in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 26,
2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2021,
which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. The Company’s material legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”
under the heading “Contingencies.”

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company
in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating
results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters
during the third quarter of 2021 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition or operating results.

The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors,
whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2020
Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the
Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated
future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. There have been no
material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2020 Form 10-K.

(1) As of June 26, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock
under the Program, announced on April 28, 2021, of which $234.1 billion had been utilized. The remaining $80.9
billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of June 26, 2021.
The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may
be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

(2) In May 2021, the Company entered into a new ASR. Under the terms of the agreement, a financial institution
committed to deliver shares of the Company’s stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment
of $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average
repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common
stock during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before August 2021.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act

Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any
of its affiliates knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with entities or individuals designated pursuant to
certain Executive Orders.

On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the “FSB”) as a
blocked party under Executive Order 13382. On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control updated General License No. 1B to authorize transactions and activities with the FSB that are
necessary and ordinarily incident to requesting, receiving, utilizing, paying for, or dealing in certain licenses,
permits, certifications or notifications issued or registered by the FSB for the importation, distribution or use
of certain information technology products in the Russian Federation.

In the three-month period ended June 26, 2021, the Company filed legally required administrative notifications with
the FSB in connection with the importation of the Company’s products into the Russian Federation, as permitted by
