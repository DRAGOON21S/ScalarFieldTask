We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some\nof our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and\nmay be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment\nin the future.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other\naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD,\nHuawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated\nor AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet\nInc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their\ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles,\nautonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm\nIncorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products\nfor their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including\noptical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nCompany, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell Technology, Inc. as well as internal teams of system\nvendors and large cloud services companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\n9\nTable of Contents\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments.\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,\nimpacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or\nany other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\ncustomers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and\nconsumer laws, could further increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item\n1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nSustainability and Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate\nsound environmental, social, and corporate governance principles and practices into every aspect of the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and\ndiscussing with management our practices related to sustainability and corporate governance. We assess our programs\nannually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These\nissues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our\nstakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and\npractices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information\ncontained on our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any\nother report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for\na discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to sustainability.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we work to address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle\nand assess related risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn May 2024, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2024. Fiscal year 2025\nmetrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to\nour capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental\nsustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or\ngenerate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under\nour operational control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, we made progress towards this goal\nand increased the percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year\n2026, we also aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG\nemissions with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it\nis optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence\non the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems—we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems,\nincluding the top supercomputer, on the November 2024 Green500 list.\nWe launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse\nplatforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of\nthe impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were\nengaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative\npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\nrelating to human capital management.\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally,\nincluding exceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been\nsuccessful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand\nand differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 82%\ntechnical and 51%\n11\nTable of Contents\nhold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting and we welcome employees\nof all backgrounds. Our own employees also help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in fiscal\nyear 2025 coming from employee referrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted\ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning\nofferings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer\ntuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications and encourage internal\njob mobility. We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and\nemployees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can grow their careers over their lifetime and our employees\ntend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and\nfinancial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside\nthe U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit\nofferings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored\nbenefits based on the needs of our employees including continuing support for parents; both new birth parents and\nthose who wish to become parents. Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic\nvolatility, to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families.\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NVIDIA\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall our employees.\nWhen recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that\nincludes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and\nHispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we:\nHire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;\nPartner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\nEnlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and\nidentify internal opportunities;\nSupport the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future\nleaders;\nProvide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\nProvide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our\nemployees to do their best work;\nTrack equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\nMeasure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of\nour workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nFlexible Working Environment\nWe support a flexible work environment allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they\nlive. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers\nand employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. We also provide company-wide 2-days\noff per quarter for employees to rest and recharge.\n12\nTable of Contents\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages, and positions as of\nFebruary 21, 2025:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       62    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

The following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which\ncould cause our stock\n13\nTable of Contents\nprice to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe\nare immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to\nestimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and could\ndamage our business.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nProduct, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect\nour financial condition, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets.\nA significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from\nselling to any of these end customers.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain, and motivate our executives and key employees.\nModification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business and\ninternal controls.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results\nare below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock, and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on\nthe export of our products, which may adversely impact our business.\nIncreased scrutiny regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in financial, reputational, or\noperational harm and liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial\nharm and liability.\nAdequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are\nunsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other\nobligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or\nregulatory proceedings and liability.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates,\nchanges in tax laws, and other tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory\nproceedings.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products\nand technologies that meet the evolving needs of our markets, including addressing unexpected shifts in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovations that could render our products incompatible with those developed\nby other companies;\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as\nsoftware-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance\nstandards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our\nbusiness, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations,\ncustomer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities, and cloud service capacity; and\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.\nWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not\nproduce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and\ntechnologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining\ndesign wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and\nfunctionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may\nprevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that our products and\ntechnologies will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our\nfinancial results may be harmed.\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and\nservices for training and deploying AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in\ntheir data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support\nthese offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services\nhave changed and may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer\nstandalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and other software\nproducts. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful\nstandalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from\nthese offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer and market needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’\nproducts, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be\ncheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in\nlower-than-expected selling prices or demand for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own\nfabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP\nportfolios and patent protections, more design\n15\nTable of Contents\nwins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able\nto acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon\nopportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our\nability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment,\nwhich could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities\nsimilar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example,\nothers may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to\nestablish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and\nwe may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate\ncustomer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated\ndemand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our\nsupply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to\nexperience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,\nprovided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our\nproduct costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to\naddress our business needs.\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not\nbe able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between\nsupply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory,\nsignificantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners\nand contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to\nmeet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be\ndamaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex\ndata center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may\nhave a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if\ncomponents necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we\nmay not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce\naverage selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products\nas a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and\nrecord impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable\nand non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we\nneed to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to\nincrease as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a\ngreater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial\nresults.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact\nthe timing and volume of our revenue, include:\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\nchanges in business and economic conditions;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products;\nchanges in end-user demand;\n16\nTable of Contents\npurchasing decisions made, and inventory levels held by, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators, other\nchannel partners and other third parties;\nthe ability of developers, end customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated\ncomputing applications that leverage our platforms;\nthe availability of third-party content on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW;\nthe demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls, increased restrictions on gaming\nusage, or tariffs; and\nour customers' ability to invest in AI infrastructure.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China,\nwhich comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and\nassembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and\nmay continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future\nproducts. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our\nsupply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\nexecution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead\nto increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing\nindustry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing\nand diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center\nsolutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center\nofferings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\nvolatility in our revenue. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and\nchannel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce,\nor create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for\ncurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple\nproduct architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have\nbeen and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as\nplanned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in\nunanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or\nother costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025\nwere negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may\nimpact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay\npurchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have\nmanaged prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions\nare difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur\nadditional costs.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our\nrevenue or supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be\nused in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision\nthe impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand\nfor our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago,\nour Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to\nestimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast\nthe future impact of\n17\nTable of Contents\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute\ntechnologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nEthereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This\nhas created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact\nretail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold\nproducts may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult.\nGray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Our\ninability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our revenue.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These\nsubcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face risks which have\nadversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,\nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity;\ndecommitment by our suppliers;\npotential higher wafer and component prices resulting from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place\norders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or timely;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain, or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nfailure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules;\nintegration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers creating more complexity in managing multiple suppliers\nwith variations in production planning, execution, and logistics;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to provide high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from issues in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology;\nsuppliers extending lead times and/or increasing costs during shortages; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes,\nfires, or other natural disasters, electricity conservation efforts, pandemics, and cybersecurity incidents.\n18\nTable of Contents\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future\ncontain defects, security vulnerabilities, experience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in\ndesign, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may also increase when our\nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and\nwhen we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements\nreduce our direct control over production. AI software products that we or our partners offer rely on training data\nthat may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or\nundetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may\ncontain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for\nwarranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in\nthe past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could\nattack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to\nsubstantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIB manufacturers,\nautomotive manufacturers, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may\ncause us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or\notherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues\nmay not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related\nsoftware drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance,\nloss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with\nexisting and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn\nnegatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to\nreimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or\nin connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data\nCenter products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and\nsupply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net\nwarranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have\naccurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our\nestimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought\nagainst us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our\nsupply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical\nand management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or\nfuture coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency\nfluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT\ninfrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global\nsupply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of\ntariffs by the USG or other governments, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging\neffects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, CSPs, data center providers, licensing parties or other\nthird parties we rely on;\nreduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for\nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances\namong other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial\ninstitutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or\nspeculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions,\nwhich could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to\nfulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are\nsubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns\nor events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio\ncomprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit\nrating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an\nunrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States, and we generated 53% of our revenue in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. The\nmarket in China, where our offerings are limited by export controls, is highly competitive and we expect it to\nremain competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and\nuncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political\nconditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to\ncontrol case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP\nand employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to\ncapital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other\nmilitary actions, terrorism, public health issues, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs, sanctions,\nand other controls on imports or exports, and catastrophic events.\nProduct, system security, and data protection incidents or breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our\noperations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against\nthem or implement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported\nactors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally,\nsome actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical\nconflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be subject to\na heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We\nmay also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other\nthird-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,\ncontractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our\nsecurity policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,\nsecurity incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security\npolicies and access control mechanisms, including, for example, employees posting company data on third-party\nwebsites without permission, and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there\ncan be no assurance that an insider threat or error will not result in an incident that is material to us or lead\nto negative publicity. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate\ncertain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to\n20\nTable of Contents\nsupply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in\nour supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable\nvulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our\nservices. We have incorporated third-party data into some of our AI models and used open-source datasets to train\nour models and may continue to do so. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased\ninformation, and may otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our\nAI outputs, leading to potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, or adverse impacts on the performance\nand reliability of our products, which could, in turn, affect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our\nrevenue. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers,\nincluding for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is\nlimited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-\nparty suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the future), our\nresponse may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other\ninformation related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large\nnumber of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of\nour customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers\nhave appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our\ncustomers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and\nsecurity awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have\nidentified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security\ncontrols, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques\nchange frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience\ndelays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These\nvulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could\nresult in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and\ncustomers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose\nus and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation\nand subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm,\nincluding financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners\nin our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our\npartners to the risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to\npotential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has\noccurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\nconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,\nrestrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds,\ndiversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar\nharms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. We are required by certain data privacy\nand security obligations to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and\ninvestors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In\naddition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural\ndisasters, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, critical infrastructure failures,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil\nunrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural\nor man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data\ncenter capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other\ncritical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring\nin these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us\ncritical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and\ndomestic political developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally.\nPolitical instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major\ncountries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide\ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where\nthe manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in\nchanging regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies,\nproduct\n21\nTable of Contents\ndemand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support\noperations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations\ncould be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any\nreason, including natural disasters, high heat events, water shortages, power shortages, information technology\nsystem failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, and business, labor, environmental, public health,\nor political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects\nus, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of\ndeclines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. All of these\nrisks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our employees in the region\nhave been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption\nto our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business;\nhowever, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations,\nand revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third\nparties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of\nthese parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase\nour reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects,\ndisruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, land or permitting constraints, or\nregulations that limit energy, water, or land availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand\ntheir data center capacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors.\nWater and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of\nour facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry\nconditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse\nimplications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability\nof our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure\nworldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and\nother risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our\npolicies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay\na claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits,\nsustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs,\nincluding costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in\nmanufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and\nenergy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and greater indirect costs resulting from our customers\nand/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could\nharm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and\nproduct design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we\nmay face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could\nharm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience\ncontractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result\nin increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could\nbe negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much\nmore energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand\nor enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could\nimpair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a\nnegative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter\ninto other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely\ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable\nto pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions\nthat reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to\nconsummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further,\nour investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to\nthe value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to\nfurther our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include\nearly-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-\nmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To\nthe extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose\nall or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline\nin any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and\nother resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties\nto realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining\ngovernmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to\nidentify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely\naffected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of\ncustomers, and this trend may continue. Sales to direct Customers A, B and C represented 12%, 11% and 11% of total\nrevenue, respectively, for fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking\nsegment. With\n23\nTable of Contents\nseveral of these partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels.\nOur operating results depend on sales to our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell\nproducts that incorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved in system\nintegration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be\nunable to meet specifications of our key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their\nownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center\nsystems to customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales\nare made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own\nsolutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose\nmarket share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’\npurchasing patterns. Many of our indirect customers often do not purchase directly from us but through multiple\nOEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through\nCustomer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking\nsegment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the\nsystem integrators, distributors, and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which\ncould impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction\nin purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees, as well as recruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is\nsubject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for\nskilled workers and leaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations,\nor in their administration or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nCompetition for talent drives up costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. In times of stock price\nvolatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-\nbased compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding\nexecutive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions\ninvolving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and long-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design\nand implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an\nimpact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our\nfinancial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors.\nTherefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance.\nFactors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n24\nTable of Contents\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt\nwrite-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny of these factors could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have\ngranted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic\ndownturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask\nfor shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and\ninvestments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be\nsustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely\nto cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the\nexport of our products, which may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use\nof AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and\nexpensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to\nmanufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers\nor agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help\nensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our\nofficers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to\nthe laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could\nlead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture\nand supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result\nof changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from\nregulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased\ninterest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United\nKingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us\nregarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing\ninquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for\ninformation from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and\nSouth Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation\nmodels and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the\nmarkets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell\nhardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to\nreceive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and could\nnegatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware,\nsoftware, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act\nbecame effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period. The EU AI Act\nmay impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or\nhave already enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or\nrelease AI models, and increase our compliance costs. Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if\nimplemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems\nusing our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and\nfinancial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in\nincreased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and\ncontrols on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the\nregions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign\ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and\nrestrictions on\n25\nTable of Contents\nthe activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and\nrestrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do\nbusiness without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual\nobligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export\ncontrol laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without\nour knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material\nand adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory\nrestrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result\nin additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns\nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in\nunilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying\nLLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of\ndownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software,\nand services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or\ntechnology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors\nassociated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions\nproposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls\nrestricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will\nbe adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from\nexporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China and over\n150 countries designated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AI Diffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our\nmanufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our\nability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are\nincreasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products,\nor services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage\nfor us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to\nadditional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business\nand financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA\nAI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their\nend customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve\ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export\ncontrols has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting\ncompetitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the\nexport control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and\nmaterially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our\nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export\ncontrols could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or\nmultilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our\nfulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example, regulators in\nChina are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against\ncustomers in the China market. If regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have\nviolated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on our ability to\nconduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our\noperations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,\nimpacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing\nrequirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of\ncertain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture\ncertain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100\nintegrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and\nchip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for\ncertain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also\ninformed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to,\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments\nof our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule).\nBlackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and\ntherefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5,\nexcluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI\nDiffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits\non “National Verified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively\nimpact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by\nexpressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier\n1 countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country.\nThese restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a\nselect number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own\naccelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG\nregulations, including foreign competition.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges\nand risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and\nrelated extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from\nother countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a\ntimely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside\nthe impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified\ncountries.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFollowing these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and\nsupply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time\nconsuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our\nrevenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent\nthat a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer.\nHowever, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or\nthat the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it\nmay impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG\nevaluates license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For\nexample, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products\nto customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted\nin license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models.\nThe requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new\nrestrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,\nincluding further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase\nproduct from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual\nwarranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies\nlicenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested\nlicenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users\ncannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the\nlicensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain\nand encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in\nChina, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer\nas a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be\nexported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling\nmechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use,\nor location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the\nUSG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our\nsupply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the\nU.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a\ngreater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our\nsupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed\nfrom Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand\nfor our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our\nnetworking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create\nlarge clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely\nhave a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips\nthat are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the\nfuture encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors\nfrom their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets\nworldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas\ngovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms,\nharming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls\nmay negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as\nEurope, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in\nU.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to\nnew unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in\nforeign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are\nsubject to worldwide licensing requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase\nobligation charges.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate\ntechnologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering\nrestrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and\ninterpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-\nbased competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products\ncontaining components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced\nrestrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours.\nAs another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards\nregarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data\ncenters in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively\nprevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers\nto use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating\nresults and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could\nnegatively impact our business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners,\nespecially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of\ncomponents, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial\nresults.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could\nresult in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers\nto do business with us.\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and\ngovernment regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those\nassociated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate\nsustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in\nthe U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations.\nAdditionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not\nmeet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate\nsustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and\nlegal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not\nexpand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure\nmay negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues.\nWe are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also\noffer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw\ncontroversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended\nconsequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective\ninternal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered\nthrough our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.\nLeveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations may present further risks,\ncosts, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI may further\nincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede\nour ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with\nregulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as\nthe European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional\nreporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code\nof Practice for General Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission\nregarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in\nAI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business\npractices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and\nregulations relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow\nadoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could\n29\nTable of Contents\ncause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the\nefforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations.\nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or\nresult in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws,\nregulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the\nprocessing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products\nand services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other\nprivacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely\naffect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our\npartners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or\nincreased security or remediation costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have\nenacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing\nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data.\nAs applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-\nout of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making.\nThe exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain\nstates also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information,\nsuch as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance.\nFor example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020,\nor CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain\nsharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The\nCCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for\ncertain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and\nlocal levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of AI and\nmachine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of\nenforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may\ndisproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices. Additionally,\nEurope’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident response\ncapabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital infrastructure sector. Non-\ncompliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative fines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up to 2% of the total\nworldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the\nUnited States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data\n30\nTable of Contents\ntransfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The\nEuropean Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer\npersonal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate\nlevel of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement /\nAddendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers\nto relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms\nare subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to\nlawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar\ncross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the\ncost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes\nvarious requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under\nChina’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and\napproval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC\nassessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using\ndata collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal\ndata to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to\ncollaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require\nus to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some\nEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating\nthe GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to\ncomply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain\nprivacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on\ntheir service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach\nexposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation,\nregulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security.\nRegulators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our\npractices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our\nproduct design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any\nthird parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may\nfail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data\nprivacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government\nenforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal\ndata, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes\nin tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe\nour tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the\namount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net\nincome, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could\nincrease our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of\noperations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with a significant\nportion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates\nincrease or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and\ncash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the\njurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including\nthe implementation of the Two-Pillar framework led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or\nOECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain multinational enterprises above a\nfixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One), and imposes a\nminimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which we conduct\nbusiness have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, elements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, or\nchanges in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our provision\nfor income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions,\n31\nTable of Contents\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon\nfinalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred\ntax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or\nregulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or\ninternational organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-\nbased compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period\nin which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based\ncompensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory\nproceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we\nand certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from\nmanufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies,\nsuch as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse\nimpact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice\nrequirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and super-majority voting requirement to amend\nsome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if\nsomeone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last\nrights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA,\ndiscourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to\ncause us to take other corporate actions they desire.",

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 21,\n2025, we had approximately 842 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIn May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was\neffected through the filing of an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the\nAmendment, with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. In June 2024, the Company filed the Amendment to effect the\nStock Split and proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock from 8.0\nbillion to 80.0 billion. Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional\nshares of common stock, distributed after the close of market on June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per\nshare amounts presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for\n$34.0 billion. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to\n$38.7 billion of our common stock.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan or in structured share repurchase agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act,\nsubject to\n33\nTable of Contents\nmarket conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.

          "content": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and\ndigital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated\ncomputing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We\nbegan shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\nor supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated\ncomputing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased\ndemand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and\nmay continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future\nproducts. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our\nsupply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\nexecution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead\nto increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing\nindustry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing\nand diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center\nsolutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center\nofferings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\nvolatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in\nquality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in\nproduct delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product\nroadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may\ndelay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have\nmanaged prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions\nare difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur\nadditional costs.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not\nrequire a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China\nthat do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025. As a\npercentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in\nOctober 2023. The market in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with\nexport controls while serving our customers. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\nperformance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\ncustomers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain\nconstraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on\nour results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these\nmacroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment\nand value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes\nin our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIsrael and Regional Conflicts\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on\nactive military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our\nproduct development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however,\nif the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nFiscal Year 2025 Summary\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025          Jan 28, 2024       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        130,497       $        60,922               Up 114%\nGross margin                                                75.0  %               72.7  %            Up 2.3 pts\nOperating expenses              $                         16,405       $        11,329               Up 45%\nOperating income                $                         81,453       $        32,972               Up 147%\nNet income                      $                         72,880       $        29,760               Up 145%\nNet income per diluted share    $                           2.94       $          1.19               Up 147%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by\ndemand for our Hopper architecture accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation\nengines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of\nAda RTX GPU workstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and engineering development, compute and infrastructure\ncosts for new product introductions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related\ndisclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We\nhave critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory\nprovisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase\n38\nTable of Contents\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for\nexisting products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in\nadvance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in\ndemand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an\nunfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times\nand constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve\nmonths for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance\nof our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also\nadjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product\ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application\nof complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added\ncertainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign\njurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities\nfor potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\nadditional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional\nincome tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not\nto be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-\nlikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return\nrights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of\nprior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns\nfor credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in\nrevenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer\nprograms include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes\nwhich require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant\ninternal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to\ndate as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each\nproject includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs\nas applicable.\n39\nTable of Contents\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration\nor interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone\nselling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not\nsell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other\nobservable inputs.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal\nyear 2024 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\nRevenue                                     100.0  %           100.0  %\nCost of revenue                              25.0               27.3\nGross profit                                 75.0               72.7\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development                      9.9               14.2\nSales, general and administrative             2.7                4.4\nTotal operating expenses                     12.6               18.6\nOperating income                             62.4               54.1\nInterest income                               1.4                1.4\nInterest expense                             -0.2               -0.4\nOther, net                                    0.8                0.4\nOther income (expense), net                   2.0                1.4\nIncome before income tax                     64.4               55.5\nIncome tax expense                            8.6                6.6\nNet income                                   55.8  %            48.9  %\n40\nTable of Contents\nReportable Segments\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended                               $         %\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $         116,193    $        47,405    $  68,788       145  %\nGraphics                           14,304             13,517          787         6  %\nTotal                   $         130,497    $        60,922    $  69,575       114  %\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended                               $         %\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $          82,875    $        32,016    $  50,859       159  %\nGraphics                            5,085              5,846         -761       -13  %\nAll Other                          -6,507             -4,890       -1,617        33  %\nTotal                   $          81,453    $        32,972    $  48,481       147  %\nCompute & Networking revenue – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing\nand AI solutions. Revenue from Data Center computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing\nplatform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Revenue from Data\nCenter networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\nplatform.\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nReportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income\nwas driven by growth in revenue. The year over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an\nincrease of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in revenue.\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense\nreflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors,\nODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and\nmay use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect\ncustomers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet\ncompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nDirect Customers – Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were\nprimarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment, are presented in the following table:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\nDirect Customer A              12  %                  *\nDirect Customer B              11  %              13  %\nDirect Customer C              11  %                  *\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIndirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer\npurchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect\ncustomer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily\npurchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is\nestimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of\ncustomers, and this trend may continue.\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to\nindirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted\nfor 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of\nsemiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing\nsupport costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and\nwarranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes\nacquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements,\nIP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase\nwas primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory\npurchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and\n2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years\n2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended                                     $         %\nJan 26, 2025          Jan 28, 2024          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $          12,914       $         8,675       $   4,239        49  %\n% of net revenue                                   9.9  %               14.2  %\nSales, general and administrative                3,491                 2,654             837        32  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   2.7  %                4.4  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          16,405       $        11,329       $   5,076        45  %\n% of net revenue                                  12.6  %               18.6  %\nThe increases in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2025 were driven by a 32% increase in\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\nincreases, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering development costs for\nnew product introductions.\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2025 were primarily driven by\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\nincreases.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended                               $\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $           1,786    $           866    $     920\nInterest expense                            -247               -257           10\nOther, net                                 1,034                237          797\nOther income (expense), net    $           2,573    $           846    $   1,727\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nOther, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in\nOther, net, compared to fiscal year 2024, was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our non-marketable\nequity securities and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our non-\nmarketable equity securities.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $11.1 billion and $4.1 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax as a\npercentage of income before income tax was an expense of 13.3% and 12.0% for fiscal years 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an\naudit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit,\nand income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax\nrate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the audit resolution.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated\nwith certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period\nthe release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our\nassessment of all available information.\nRefer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         8,589    $         7,280\nMarketable securities                              34,621             18,704\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        43,210    $        25,984\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating           $        64,089    $        28,090\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $       -20,421    $       -10,566\nNet cash used in financing activities    $       -42,359    $       -13,633\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of\ninvestment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, due to growth in\nrevenue.\nCash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by\nnet purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher\nshare repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our\noperations.

Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item\n15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for\n$34.0 billion. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to\n$38.7 billion of our common stock.\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a\npre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees\nwhile maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases\nas we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash\ndividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in\nthe best interests of our shareholders.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares\nissued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase\ncost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 26, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\nJan 26, 2025\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $             —\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  2,750\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -37\nNet long-term carrying amount                   $         8,463\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 26, 2025, we\nhad no commercial paper outstanding.\n44\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nFor a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 11,\nNote 12, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024, we spent $3.4 billion and $1.1 billion on capital expenditures,\nrespectively. We expect to increase capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 relative to fiscal year 2025 to\nsupport the future growth of our business.\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $251 million, were\nrecorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2025. We are unable to estimate the timing of\nany potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the\nunderlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 13\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nfurther information.\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability\nregulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for\nthese investments of $238 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our\nsales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or\nexpenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not\nsignificant for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been $136 million and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January 26, 2025 and\nJanuary 28, 2024, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by\n45\nTable of Contents\ncorresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming\nthe hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.",

Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 26, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose\nin reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n26, 2025.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 26,\n2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update much of our\nexisting core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to\nreport operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there\nare changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n46\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the\nCompany’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was\n$30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past

accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nIn June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share\namounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the\nStock Split.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were\nall 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill,\nincome taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-\nmarketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges,\nrevenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment\nterms, is generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of\nservices.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market\nsegment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We\naccount for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with\nsupport, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates\nand upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the\ncustomer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a\nstandalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a\nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the\nprice we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from oneto three yearsfor products to repair or replace products\nfor manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product\nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an\nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification\nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on\nour corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the\nfair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs.\nThe compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over\nthe requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be\nissued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an\noffering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an\naccelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected\nforfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a\nloss in any of our pending litigation,\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we\nwill record the loss. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially\ndifferent from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that a loss is\nreasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and\nliabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts\nor circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies\nbased on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that\npayment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we\nmay be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part,\nto jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity\nawards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held equity securities.\nWe classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in\ncurrent operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.\nThese available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The\nfair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of\nmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income\n(expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-\nsale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by\nexpected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we\nwill be required or we intend to\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nsell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are\nrecognized in the Other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPublicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other\nincome (expense), net.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable\ndebt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are\nrecognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value\nhedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses\nor gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a\ncomponent of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure\nis recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value\nare recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is\ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of twoto seven years.\nOnce an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or\namortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to\nthirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold\nimprovements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or\nthe estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\n60\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a\nquantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer\nrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently\namortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that\nreflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or,\nif that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected\nto be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its\nestimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and\nliabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would\nbe reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be\ndepreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the\npurchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and\nassumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount\nrate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently\nuncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement\nperiod of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in\nthe same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market\nand the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All\ngains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted\nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is\nidentified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring\ndisclosures of significant expenses in operating segments. We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual\nreport. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for further information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures,\nincluding disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this\nstandard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material\nimpact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense\ninformation on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory,\nemployee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense\ncaption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect\nthe adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than\nadditional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to\nsignificant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition\ntermination cost of $ 1.4billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at\nsigning.\nNote 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is associated with RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.\nConsolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into\ninventory and subsequently recognized to cost of revenue, as follows:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nCost of revenue                      $           178    $           141    $           138\nResearch and development                       3,423              2,532              1,892\nSales, general and administrative              1,136                876                680\nTotal                                $         4,737    $         3,549    $         2,710\nStock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nThe following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions, except per share\ndata\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nAwards granted                                                         89                140                250\nEstimated total grant-date fair     $                               7,834    $         5,316    $         4,505\nvalue\nWeighted average grant-date fair\nvalue                               $                               87.99    $         37.41    $         18.37\nper share\nESPP\nShares purchased                                                       30                 30                 30\nWeighted average price per share    $                               17.74    $         15.81    $         12.25\nWeighted average grant-date fair\nvalue                               $                                8.61    $          6.99    $          5.19\nper share\nAs of January 26, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $ 11.6billion, which is expected to\nbe recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one yearfor\nESPP.\nThe fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025                      Jan 28, 2024    Jan 29, 2023\n-Using the Black-Scholes model\nESPP\nWeighted average expected life (in    0.1-2.0                           0.1-2.0         0.1-2.0\nyears)\nRisk-free interest rate               3.6%-5.4%                         3.9%-5.5%       —%-4.6%\nVolatility                            31%-75%                           31%-67%         43%-72%\nDividend yield                        0.03%                             0.06%           0.09%\nFor ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the\npurchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSUs,\nPSUs, and market-based PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of\nRSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical\nforfeitures.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In\naddition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards\ngranted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended\nand restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs\nand market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan. As of January 26, 2025, up to 274million shares of our common stock\ncould be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, and 1.4billion shares were available for\nfuture grants.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs vest generally over four years subject to continued service. PSUs vest over\nfour years, subject to continued service and performance conditions. Market-based PSUs vest on the third\nanniversary of the date of grant subject to market conditions. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs\nand market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of\npre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently\namended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. Starting in March 2025, employees may have up to 25% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about 24months,\ndivided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be\nequal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering\nperiod or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 26,\n2025, we had 2.2billion shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nOutstanding\nNumber of Shares\n(In millions, except per share       Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair\ndata)                        Value Per Share\nBalance as of Jan 28, 2024                                           367    $                             24.59\nGranted                                                               89    $                             87.99\nVested                                                              -173    $                             24.89\nCanceled and forfeited                                                -9    $                             32.10\nBalance as of Jan 26, 2025                                           274    $                             44.75\nVested and expected to vest after\nJan                                                                  272    $                             44.59\n26, 2025\nAs of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, there were 1.4billion and 1.5billion shares, respectively, of common\nstock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nThe total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 26,\n2025, January 28, 2024, and January 29, 2023, was $ 15.1billion, $ 8.2billion, and $ 4.3billion, respectively.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 4 - Net Income Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for\nthe periods presented:\nYear Ended\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions, except per share\ndata\nNumerator:\nNet income                          $                              72,880    $        29,760    $         4,368\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares                                      24,555             24,690             24,870\nDilutive impact of outstanding\nequity                                                                249                250                200\nawards\nDiluted weighted average shares                                    24,804             24,940             25,070\nNet income per share:\nBasic (1)                           $                                2.97    $          1.21    $          0.18\nDiluted (2)                         $                                2.94    $          1.19    $          0.17\nAnti-dilutive equity awards\nexcluded                                                               51                150                400\nfrom diluted net income per\nshare\n(1) Net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n(2) Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\nNote 5 - Goodwill\nAs of January 26, 2025, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 5.2billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.8billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nAs of January 28, 2024, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.1billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nGoodwill increased by $ 758million in fiscal year 2025 from acquisitions and was allocated to our Compute &\nNetworking reporting unit.

Realized gains and losses on investments in publicly-held\nequity securities sold during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were not significant.\n66\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nJan 28,\n2024\nAmortized       Unrealized        Unrealized         Estimated         Reported\nCost             Gain              Loss        Fair Value               as\nCash        Marketable\nEquivalents        Securities\n-In\nmillions\nCorporate\ndebt          $       10,126    $          31    $           -5    $       10,152    $       2,231    $   7,921\nsecurities\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by              9,517               17               -10             9,524            1,315        8,209\nthe U.S.\nTreasury\nMoney\nmarket                 3,031                —                 —             3,031            3,031            —\nfunds\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by              2,326                8                -1             2,333               89        2,244\nU.S.\ngovernment\nagencies\nCertifica…               510                —                 —               510              294          216\nof deposit\nForeign\ngovernment               174                —                 —               174               60          114\nbonds\nTotal debt\nsecurities\nwith fair\nvalue\nchanges       $       25,684    $          56    $          -16    $       25,724    $       7,020    $  18,704\nrecorded\nin other\ncomprehen…\nincome\nThe following tables provide the breakdown of unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of\ntime that individual debt securities have been in a continuous loss position:\nJan 26,\n2025\nLess than                         12 Months                             Total\n12 Months                        or Greater\nEstimated            Gross        Estimated       Gross             Estimated            Gross\nFair Value       Unrealized       Fair Value       Unrealized       Fair Value       Unrealized\nLoss                        Loss                                    Loss\n-In\nmillions\nDebt\nsecuriti…\nissued by    $       6,315    $         -22    $         177    $  —             $       6,492    $         -22\nthe U.S.\nTreasury\nCorporate\ndebt                 5,291              -29               15       —                     5,306              -29\nsecuriti…\nDebt\nsecuriti…\nissued by              816               -5               21       —                       837               -5\nU.S.\ngovernme…\nagencies\nTotal        $      12,422    $         -56    $         213    $  —             $      12,635    $         -56\nJan 28,\n2024\nLess than                         12 Months                             Total\n12 Months                        or Greater\nEstimated            Gross        Estimated            Gross        Estimated            Gross\nFair Value       Unrealized       Fair Value       Unrealized       Fair Value       Unrealized\nLoss                              Loss                              Loss\n-In\nmillions\nDebt\nsecuriti…\nissued by    $       3,343    $          -5    $       1,078    $          -5    $       4,421    $         -10\nthe U.S.\nTreasury\nCorporate\ndebt                 1,306               -3              618               -2            1,924               -5\nsecuriti…\nDebt\nsecuriti…\nissued by              670               -1                —                —              670               -1\nU.S.\ngovernme…\nagencies\nTotal        $       5,319    $          -9    $       1,696    $          -7    $       7,015    $         -16\nGross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities included in cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities are shown below by contractual maturity.\n67\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nJan 26, 2025                        Jan 28, 2024\nAmortized        Estimated          Amortized        Estimated\nCost       Fair Value               Cost       Fair Value\n-In millions\nLess than one year    $        18,426    $      18,450    $        16,336    $      16,329\nDue in 1 - 5 years             23,636           23,656              9,348            9,395\nTotal                 $        42,062    $      42,106    $        25,684    $      25,724\nNote 8 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Non-marketable Equity Securities\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical\nassets or market prices of similar assets from active markets.

Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts greater than one year in length\nwill be recognized over the next twelve months.\nNote 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on\nour operating expenses. The foreign currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting\nhedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and\nreclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. In fiscal years\n2025 and 2024, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other\ncomprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.\nWe also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on\nmonetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair\nvalue of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair\nvalue of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other\nincome or expense.\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:\nJan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nDesignated as accounting hedges        $         1,424    $         1,168\nNot designated as accounting hedges    $         1,297    $           597\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of January\n26, 2025 and January 28, 2024.\nAs of January 26, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within 18months. The expected realized gains and\nlosses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts\nwithin the next twelve months were not significant.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 11 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nExpected    Effective\nRemaining Term (years)    Interest Rate       Jan 26, 2025       Jan 28, 2024\n-In millions\n0.584% Notes Due 2024 (1)                              —    0.66%            $             —    $         1,250\n3.20% Notes Due 2026                                 1.6    3.31%                      1,000              1,000\n1.55% Notes Due 2028                                 3.4    1.64%                      1,250              1,250\n2.85% Notes Due 2030                                 5.2    2.93%                      1,500              1,500\n2.00% Notes Due 2031                                 6.4    2.09%                      1,250              1,250\n3.50% Notes Due 2040                                15.2    3.54%                      1,000              1,000\n3.50% Notes Due 2050                                25.2    3.54%                      2,000              2,000\n3.70% Notes Due 2060                                35.2    3.73%                        500                500\nUnamortized debt discount and\nissuance                                                                                 -37                -41\ncosts\nNet carrying amount                                                                    8,463              9,709\nLess short-term portion                                                                    —             -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                                                      $         8,463    $         8,459\n(1) In fiscal year 2025, we repaid the 0.584% Notes Due 2024.\nOur notes are unsecured senior obligations.

We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that\nallow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are\ncancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. Though,\nchanges to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $\n14.3billion, including $ 10.9billion of multi-year cloud service agreements.

The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August\n25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district\ncourt’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the\nNinth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on\nOctober 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending\nNVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final\ndisposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the\nSupreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument,\nthe Supreme\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nCourt dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on\nJanuary 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August\n28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of\nus, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of\ncorporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination\nof allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining\non GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements\nto NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment\ndismissing the Company’s petition for writ of certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation\nSecurities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30days while the parties discuss next steps\nand ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on\nbehalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\nenrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a),\n10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified\ndamages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate\ngovernance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,\ncaptioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of\nus, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This\nderivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 26, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described\nabove based on our belief that liabilities, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss\nor range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.4billion of cumulative undistributed\nearnings held by certain subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for\ntemporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of both January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital\nloss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the\nextent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax\nassets as income tax benefits during the period.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated\nwith certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period\nthe release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our\nassessment of all available information.\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 479million, $\n332million and $ 349million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years\n2026 and 2027, respectively.

The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We\nrecognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our\nconsolidated statements of income of $ 92million, $ 42million, and $ 33million during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and\n2023, respectively. As of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we have accrued $ 251million and $ 140million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 26, 2025, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26,\n2025, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal\nyears after 2021, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal\nyears 2014 through 2024. As of January 26, 2025, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under\nexamination include Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2014 through 2024, and the State\nof California for fiscal years 2020 to 2022.\nNote 14 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $ 50billion to our share repurchase\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 310million and 210million shares\nof our common stock for $ 34.0billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized,\nsubject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $ 38.7billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase\nprogram aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our\noperating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment\nopportunities.\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29million shares for $ 3.7billion pursuant to a\npre-established trading plan.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nIn fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $ 834million, $ 395million, and\n$ 398million, respectively. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing\ndetermination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\nNote 15 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $ 314million, $ 255million, and $ 227million,\nrespectively.\nNote 16 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information\npresented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our\nCODM assesses operating performance of each segment based on regularly provided segment revenue and segment\noperating income. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and\ncosts or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our\ntwosegments. Our CODM reviews expenses on a consolidated basis, and expenses attributable to each segment are not\nregularly provided to our CODM.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and AI solutions and\nsoftware; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and\nother embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing services.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse Enterprise software for building and operating industrial AI and digital twin applications.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that are not allocated to either Compute & Networking or Graphics\nfor purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based\ncompensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other\nnon-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis.
