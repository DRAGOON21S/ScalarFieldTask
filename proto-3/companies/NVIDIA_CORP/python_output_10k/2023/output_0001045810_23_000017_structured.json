Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for\ndevelopers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that\nleverage our platforms.\nAs NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to\nplatforms, systems and software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in\nour partner network, certain of our products are also sold direct to CSPs, enterprise customers, retail channels\nand consumers.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers,\nprofessional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half\nof our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for\nnotebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker\nrevenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and\nour revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy,\nwhereby we employ key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly,\ntesting, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the\nInternational Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and\nassurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated\nwith owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products, such as memory, substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible\nfor procurement of most of the raw materials used in the\n9\nTable of Contents\nproduction of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality\nassurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product\ncomponents in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and\ncapacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations. We utilize\nsuppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce\nour semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers, such as Amkor\nTechnology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., or BYD Auto, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Hon Hai, King Yuan Electronics Co.,\nLtd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform\nassembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex\nLtd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter\ncard products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our networking cables. We purchase substrates from\nIbiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from\nMicron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or\nmaterials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc. and\nChroma ATE Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto and Hon Hai,\ndistributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel,\nand the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test\nspecifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some\nof our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and\nmay be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment\nin the future.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other\naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD,\nand Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing chips and software that incorporate accelerated or\nAI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc.,\nAmazon, Inc., and Baidu, Inc.;\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms;\n10\nTable of Contents\nsuppliers of SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming\ndevices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas\nElectronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use,\nsuch as Tesla, Inc.; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch cable solutions, and DPUs such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista\nNetworks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks,\nInc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud\nservices companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally.

Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government announced new license requirements that impact\ncertain exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of some of our data center products. The impact\nof the new license requirements is difficult to quantify, and it may be challenging for us to manage our operations\nand forecast our operating results due to these requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to\nRegulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nAdditionally, our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such\nregulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a\nmaterial impact on our business. In February 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by\nwhich we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the\ntransaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI,\n11\nTable of Contents\nclimate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and\notherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in\nsubsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate\nsound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the\nCompany. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing\nand discussing with management our practices related to ESG. We assess our programs annually in consideration of\nstakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our\ncontinued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and\npractices. More information can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual\nCorporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is\nnot incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nthe SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks,\nincluding current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year\n2022. Fiscal year 2023 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2024. There has been\nno material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year\n2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for\nour offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs\nare inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput,\nperformance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued\nstrong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most energy\nefficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will\nenable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate\nchange and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had 26,196 employees in 35 countries, 19,532 were engaged in\nresearch and development and 6,664 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and\nhave been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted strong talent globally with our\ndifferentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive and diverse recruits. The COVID-19\npandemic created expanded hiring opportunities in new geographies and provided increased\n12\nTable of Contents\nflexibility for employees to work from locations of their choice. Our workforce is about 80% technical and about\n50% hold advanced degrees.\nEarlier in fiscal year 2023, we slowed our hiring to focus on our current employees and manage costs. We maintain a\nconnection for global talent from universities through on-campus collaborations with professors and student\norganizations, as well as engagement with technical organizations and participation at industry conferences. Our\nown employees help to surface top talent, with over 37% of our new hires in fiscal year 2023 coming from employee\nreferrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops,\npanel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common development needs and\nconstantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and\ntechnologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced\ncertifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental\nactivities and internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development\nprograms for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for\nfuture advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize\nareas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts\nabout making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come\nand stay. In fiscal year 2023, our overall turnover rate was 5.3%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and\nfinancial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee\nstock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-\nmanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the\nregions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including\nassistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those\nwho wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or managing current talent, we focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining a more\ndiverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women,\nBlack/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\nAssigning dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process;\n13\nTable of Contents\nEmbedding inclusion recruiting partners throughout the business to help align candidates with internal\nopportunities;\nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;\nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for nine internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for\ndiversity;\nEnsuring we have and review a diverse pool of candidates for requisitions; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of\nour workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nHealth and COVID-19\nWe supported our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority during fiscal year 2023\nand throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our workforce safe.\nHybrid Working Environment\nWe support a hybrid work environment, understanding that many employees want the flexibility to work in the office\nor from home, and make that decision based on the conditions around them at any point in time.\nSteps we took to support employees working from home include:\nHome-focused health and well-being programs;\nLearning and development resources on how to work, lead and manage remotely; and\nOpportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days”\nfor employees to recharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of\nFebruary 17, 2023:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       60    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

          "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not\nlimited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part\nof your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\n15\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology reduces our control over product quantity and quality,\nmanufacturing yields, development, enhancement, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and can damage\nour business.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nInternational operations are a significant part of our business, and economic, political, business, and other\nchanges in the regions in which we operate may expose us to risks that could harm our business.\nProduct, system security, and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect\nour financial condition, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets.\nA significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of customers and could be adversely affected if\nwe lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees.\nModification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business,\nprocesses and internal controls.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results\nare below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely\nimpact our business.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance\nresponsibilities could result in financial, reputational and operational harm.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational and\nfinancial harm and liability.\nAdequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are\nunsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other\nobligations. Privacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter\ncustomers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates and\nother tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents, and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance existing products and\ntechnologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies;\ndevelop new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including standalone software, cloud solutions, and software-,\ninfrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety and compliance standards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including\nour acquisitions integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity;\nand\ncomplete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\nWe invest in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce\nmeaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies,\nor if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins\nmay involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that\ncustomers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from\nobtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we\nbring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our\nfinancial results may be harmed.\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples\nof these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI\nmodels, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host\nthese services in their data centers, and we entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of\nfiscal year 2023 to support these offerings and our research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services\nmay not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone\nsoftware solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and\nseveral other software solutions. These new\n17\nTable of Contents\nbusiness models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or\nas-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these\nofferings.\nCompetition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or\nprovide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower than\nexpected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new\ndesigns and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These\ncompetitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and\ncapitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products,\nand secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could\nharm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to\nsome of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may\noffer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish\nmarket share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which\nwould cause our revenue to decline.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long\nmanufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply\ndeliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are\nultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a significant mismatch between\nsupply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our\nmarket platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past\nentered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure\nsufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs or our long-term demand expectations may change.\nAdditionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties\nthat are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor\nindustry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We\nhave previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits\nto secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not\nhave the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\nDemand for our products is based on many factors in addition to the lead times described above that have caused\nand/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our\nproducts, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume\nof our revenue, including:\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local\nhealth issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\ntime to market;\n18\nTable of Contents\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and AI cloud service\nofferings;\nthe demand for cryptocurrency mining; or\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage.\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown\nsignificantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of\nour total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with\ndemand for our products.\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are\ncomplex and frequently negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products\nsimultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture\ntransitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to predict\ndemand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions\nand channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can\ncreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand\nfor current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple\nproduct architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. While we have managed prior\nproduct transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned\nfor any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers.\nAs a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing\nmarket conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various\ndownstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-\ntime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a\ntimely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do\nso in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we\nfail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we\ncould lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose\nto purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase\ncommitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel\npricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of\nfuture demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products\nin the future. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments.\nThese impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in\nadvance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future\nproducts. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a\ngreater portion of our total supply while our\n19\nTable of Contents\nrevenue has sequentially declined. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial\nresults.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples\ninclude our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates\nfor these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we\nmay not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as\nthose involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,\ncontract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material\nadverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use\ncases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent\nspikes and drops in demand. For example, a number of years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital\ncurrency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact\nof cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create\nincreased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand\nfor our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining\ncapability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the\nEthereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new\nproducts or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes\ndemand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and\ndistribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that\nleverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content\navailable on our platforms such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers to build applications that leverage our\nplatforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable\nterms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our\nproducts reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and\nproduct delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely\non third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products\nor product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from\nour products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. We face several risks which have\nadversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,\nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\n20\nTable of Contents\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers, and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural\ndisasters and electricity conservation efforts.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain\ndefects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of\nissues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our\nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released.\nThese risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our\nproducts, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component\nproviders may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the\ncustomer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services\nhave been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that\ncould attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead\nto substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs\nand automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect\nmay cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or\notherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues\nmay not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases, or related\nsoftware drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance,\nloss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with\nexisting and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn\nnegatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to\nreimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or\nin connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFor example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This\ndefect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components\nand finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during\nfiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for\nwarranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be\nincorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if\nthe alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost\nof defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel\nand harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be\nunavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, higher\ninterest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases\nin unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past and/or could in the\nfuture have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin and may continue to do so;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensing parties; reduced profitability may also\ncause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially\ncease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could\nadversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions\nand insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nInternational operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to us to risks that could harm\nour business.\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested\nand packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 69% of our revenue during\nfiscal year 2023 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number\nof risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and\npolitical conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government\nlockdowns to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues, differing legal standards with\nrespect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural practices\nthat differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural\ndisasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\n22\nTable of Contents\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,\nreduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our\nreputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or\nimplement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nThreat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to\ncontinue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other\nmajor conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-\nattacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. Furthermore, we rely on\nproducts and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including\nwithout limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other\nfunctions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third\nparties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that\nthey do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information\ntechnology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that\nsupport our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and\nthese may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party\nsuppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct\naccess to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are\nincorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or\nservices are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could\nresult in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the\nevolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While\nwe take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to\ndetect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have\ninstalled, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident\nhas occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address\nidentified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm.\nWe hold confidential and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of\nour security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary\ninformation or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to\na risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability,\nregulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our\nbusiness. For example, we hold propriety game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of\nour GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse\nof this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If\nwe or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to\nhave experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement\nactions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,\nindemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial loss, loss of data, material\ndisruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and\nservices, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a\nresult of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n23\nTable of Contents\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs .\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence,\npolitical and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or\nman-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center\ncapacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical\nbusiness operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations\nvulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these\ngeographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical\ninfrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide\ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where\nthe manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in\nchanging regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies,\nproduct demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted\nand may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales\nsupport operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our\noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are\ndisrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology\nsystem failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\nThe ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in\ncertain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-\nparty systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue,\nincreases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks\nand conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and\nvendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical,\nand certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind\ncoupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which\ncan have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including\nimpairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and\ncritical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our\ncustomers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher\nattrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety\nof property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability\nand cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be\nunable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater\ndirect costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw\nmaterials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and\nhigher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter\nour operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the\nimplications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our\nstated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025,\nwhich could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional,\n24\nTable of Contents\nunexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays\narising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face\ndecreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy\nefficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of\nour products, could negatively impact our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and\ntechnologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or\ninvestments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a\nparticular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our\nother strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to\nretain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and\nother changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact\nour business. For example, in February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing\nthe completion of the transaction. We recorded in operating expenses a $1.35 billion charge in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce\nthe ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate\nacquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold\ninvestments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to\nthe value of the investment.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or\nstrategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and\napprovals or financing;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n25\nTable of Contents\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be\nadversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of\nthese partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to\npurchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing\npatterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel,\nchange or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or\ncustomers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our\npartners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of\nwhich may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant\nreduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade\nrestrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are\nbeyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost\ninflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit\nregulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation,\nand in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the\nretentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services\nof our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and\nsmooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and\nlong-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. In fiscal year 2023, we\ncontinued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource\nplanning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming\nerrors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report\nour financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our\ncustomers, partners, vendors and suppliers. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create\nsupply chain and logistics constraints, and COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among\nother areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated\nas the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in China. End customer\nsales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if\nlockdowns return. COVID-19 has also resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of and volatility in\nglobal financial markets, which could impact overall technology spending or negatively affect our stock price and\nliquidity. All of these factors have had or could in the future have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, including with respect to flexible work\nand social distancing measures, and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the\nbest interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. These and other measures have caused and may in\nthe future cause us to incur incremental expenses and costs.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to\ntimely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. The impact of COVID-19\ncan also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described\nin these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but\nare not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\nour ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customers and their extended payment terms, and customer\nbad debt write-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial\nresults. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers,\nparticularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have\nrequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These\narrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. Failure to meet our expectations or\nthe expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in\nthe past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations;\ncybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our\ncompetitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our\nproducts. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance\nwith such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules\nand regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to\nmaterially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply\nour products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes\nor increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from\nregulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public\nconcern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their\ninterpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or\nincrease to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory\nactions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.\nAdditionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate\ncould negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government\nbodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic\nsanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products,\nprovide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to\nchange from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on\nour business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar\napplicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various\npenalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue to\ndo so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions\nthat target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in\nadditional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could include\nadditional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited\nto AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and\nassociated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S.\nand its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls\nmay be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one\nor more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and\nwarehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad\nand could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting\nGPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our ability to export our\ntechnology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a\ncompetitive disadvantage for us and\n28\nTable of Contents\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact\ndemand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral\nor multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and\nexport licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions\nimpact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce,\nand manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our\nA100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated\ncircuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving\ncertain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes\nthose circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking\nproducts, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China.\nWe are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time\nconsuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our\nrevenue, during any such transition period.\nWe have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license\nrequirements, such as our new A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new\nlicense requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant any\nexemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The new requirements\nmay have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who\nsell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and\ncompetitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings,\nif customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable\nto provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a\ntimely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory,\nharming our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\nburdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our\ncompetitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more\ncumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including\nsemiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance\nresponsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of\ncustomers and suppliers to do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have\nplaced increased importance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these\nparties, as well as government regulators, have focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices\nand disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied\nwith our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. Additionally, our ESG practices, oversight of ESG practices,\nor disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator, or other industry stakeholder expectations, or\nwe may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or ESG reporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, choose not to conduct\nbusiness with potential\n29\nTable of Contents\ncustomers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may\nnegatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational and financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational and financial harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such\nissues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI poses emerging\nethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we\nenable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI\nsolutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy,\nemployment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal\npolicies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through\nour sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance\nwith government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development,\nand changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change\nour business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address concerns relating\nto the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our\nproducts and services or cause reputational harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they\nmay also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations.\nPrivacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and\npotential customers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe may process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern\nthe processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use\n30\nTable of Contents\nof our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal\ninformation or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our\npossession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption\nof our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows\nfor statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of\ncertain categories of sensitive personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising\ntechniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the\nprivate right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose administrative\nfines for noncompliance. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation\nwhich differ from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023. Similar laws are being considered in several other\nstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted\nmeasures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become\nsubject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could\nimpose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our\nbusiness practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to\nthe United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries\noutside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities\nto validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to\nprovide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. While the European Union and United States\ngovernments have recently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism,\nit is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two European Union-United\nStates bilateral cross-border transfer agreements. These mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States.\nOther jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local\npersonal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could\nresult in fines from regulators. For example, China law imposes various requirements relating to data processing\nand data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China law, including personal data, may not be\ntransferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or\nCAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments,\ncould cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer\ndata outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and\nnegatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to\nEuropean, China, and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing\ncapabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies\nfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer\nlimitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply\nwith such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example,\n31\nTable of Contents\ncertain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and\nif a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to\nlitigation, regulatory action, or fines. We may publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements,\nsuch as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security.\nIf these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair,\nor misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or\nother adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate\nchanges to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process\npersonal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security\nobligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions,\nlitigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to\ndestroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\nbusiness, or financial condition.\nWe have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than\nexpected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are\ncurrently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and undergoing tax\naudits in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome\ncould increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business,\nand harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business.\nThese include changes to U.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15%\nminimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us\nin fiscal year 2023. It is possible that these changes, or other tax law changes, could increase our future tax\nliability or cause other adverse impacts. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant\nportion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates\nincrease or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and\ncash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise\nas a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development, or OECD. The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and continues to\ndevelop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and\nestablishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty\nand adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of tax audits, changes in\naccounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not\ndeductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation\nallowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business\ncombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure.\nFurthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may\nsignificantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may\nresult in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely\naffect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to\n32\nTable of Contents\nour business. For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from\nmultiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or\nfines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-\nconsuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior\nnotes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we\nmay receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial\ncondition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a\nsubstantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our\nflexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and\nrestrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially\nchange our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we\nbreach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness\nmay be declared immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and\nliquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such\nfinancing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting\nrequirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with\nMicrosoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 17,\n2023, we had approximately 344 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase\nadditional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares for a total cost of $17.12 billion\nthrough January 29, 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 63 million shares for $10.04 billion. As of\nJanuary 29, 2023, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up\nto $7.23 billion through December 2023.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in\ncompliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and\nother factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the\nprogram may be suspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we paid $398 million in quarterly cash dividends.

          "content": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics,\nmetaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown\nsignificantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of\nour total supply. Inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations totaled $2.17 billion in\nfiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with\ndemand for our products.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we\nand our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture\nof our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of\nnew product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. While we have managed prior product\ntransitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples\ninclude our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates\nfor these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we\nmay not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.\nNVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples\nof these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI\nmodels, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host\nthese services in their data centers.\nWe entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to these offerings and\nour research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time,\nresources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI\nEnterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions. These new business\nmodels or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-\nservice solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\n36\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced new license requirements that, with certain\nexceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated\ncircuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. We\nare required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), including research and\ndevelopment and supply and distribution operations. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative\nproducts not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and\ncompetitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings,\nif customers purchase product from competitors, or if customers develop their own internal solution, if the USG\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant\ntransition costs.\nCOVID-19\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office\ncosts as we ramped onsite services.\nRestrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19\ncontainment efforts in China. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been\nnegatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions\nhave created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand\ncould become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis.\nRussia\nIn fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and later in the year, we closed business operations in\nRussia. Direct sales to Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our revenue to partners that sell into Russia\nmay have been negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine.\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the\ntransaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\nFiscal Year 2023 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,          January 30,\n2023                 2022       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        26,974       $       26,914       —       %\nGross margin                                               56.9  %              64.9  %            Down 8.0 pts\nOperating expenses              $                        11,132       $        7,434               Up 50%\nIncome from operations          $                         4,224       $       10,041               Down 58%\nNet income                      $                         4,368       $        9,752               Down 55%\nNet income per diluted share    $                          1.74       $         3.85               Down 55%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2023 revenue was $26.97 billion, flat compared with a year ago.\n37\nTable of Contents\nData Center revenue was up 41% from a year ago led by strong growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects\npurchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud\nservice offerings and our research and development activities.\nGaming revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory\nlevels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting a lower sell-in to partners to help\nreduce channel inventory levels.\nAutomotive revenue was up 60% from a year ago reflecting growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing\nsolutions for electric vehicle makers and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions. The increase also included\ngrowth in automotive development arrangements.\nOEM and Other revenue was down 61% from a year ago driven by notebook OEM and CMP. CMP revenue was nominal in\nfiscal year 2023 and $550 million in fiscal year 2022.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely\nrelating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand\nexpectations for these products, particularly for the expected demand in China. The inventory charges were\ncomprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of\nour demand expectations.\nOperating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction,\nwere up 50% from a year ago. The increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering\ndevelopment costs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash\ndividends. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase\nauthorization through December 2023.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $15.01 billion, up 41% from fiscal year 2022. The strong growth in\nData Center revenue was influenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of our accelerated computing platforms and\nnetworking portfolio. In Data Center, we announced the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and began ramping the first\nproducts based on the architecture, including the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. The NVIDIA OVX server reference\ndesign launched for digital twins and other Omniverse applications. We completed two new large language models for\ncloud AI services — NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM. Additionally, we announced the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 end-\nto-end 400Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2 in December 2022.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $9.07 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Gaming results were\ninfluenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our channel partners. We\nintroduced pricing programs for our channel partners and started undershipping GPU supply to the partners so that\nwe could lower inventory in the channel. As we exited fiscal year 2023, we have made meaningful progress in\nestablishing lower inventory levels with our channel partners. In Gaming, we announced the new Ada Lovelace GPU\narchitecture, and introduced the first products based on Ada, including the GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX\n4070 Ti desktop GPUs and laptop GPUs featured in over 170 laptop designs. We introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 for over 50\ngames and applications. We brought GeForce RTX 4080-class performance to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.54 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022.\nProfessional Visualization results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess\ninventory with our OEM partners. In Professional Visualization, we added new NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX GPUs\nfor workstations. We also announced Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud and released a major update\nto NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 60% compared to fiscal year 2022 to $903 million. In Automotive, we\nstarted production of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle SOC and introduced next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE\nThor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and\nfuture product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which\nrequires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product\nintroductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end\nuse cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the\nimpact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nCancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\nan unfavorable impact of 7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company,\nwe must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must\naccount for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the past, our manufacturing lead times\nhave been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-cancellable\ninventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings\nand pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may\nimpact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling\n39\nTable of Contents\nprice basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each\nperformance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management\ndetermined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income,\nincluding capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we\nwould recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n40\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on\nadvances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage,\nand network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five\nyears to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024.\nBased on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net\nin use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating\nincome by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal\nyear 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s\nwebsite at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             43.1              35.1\nGross profit                                56.9              64.9\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development                    27.2              19.6\nSales, general and administrative            9.1               8.0\nAcquisition termination cost                 5.0                 —\nTotal operating expenses                    41.3              27.6\nIncome from operations                      15.6              37.3\nInterest income                              1.0               0.1\nInterest expense                            -1.0              -0.9\nOther, net                                  -0.1               0.4\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.1              -0.4\nIncome before income tax                    15.5              36.9\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                -0.7               0.7\nNet income                                  16.2  %           36.2  %\n41\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,            $         %\n2023              2022       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $          15,068    $       11,046    $   4,022        36  %\nGraphics                           11,906            15,868       -3,962       -25  %\nTotal                   $          26,974    $       26,914    $      60         —  %\nCompute & Networking - The year-on-year increase was led by growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects\npurchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud\nservice offerings and our research and development activities. The increase was also related to the growth in\nAutomotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023 compared to $550 million in fiscal year\n2022.\nGraphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory\nlevels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan\nrelated to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed\nlocation even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was\nprimarily due to $2.17 billion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04\nbillion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our\ncurrent demand projections.\nInventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% and 0.9% in\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCompute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when\ncompared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions.\nGraphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year\n2022, primarily due to inventory and related provisions and lower margins of GeForce GPUs.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,          January 30,               $         %\n2023                 2022          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           7,339       $        5,268       $   2,071        39  %\n% of revenue                                      27.2  %              19.6  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,440                2,166             274        13  %\nexpenses\n% of revenue                                       9.1  %               8.0  %\nAcquisition termination cost                     1,353                    —           1,353       100  %\n% of revenue                                       5.0  %                 —  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          11,132       $        7,434       $   3,698        50  %\n% of revenue                                      41.3  %              27.6  %\nThe increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased\ncompensation, employee growth, engineering development costs, and data center infrastructure.\nThe increase in sales, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased\ncompensation and employee growth.\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,            $         %\n2023              2022       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $             267    $           29    $     238       821  %\nInterest expense                            -262              -236          -26        11  %\nOther, net                                   -48               107         -155      -145  %\nOther income (expense), net    $             -43    $         -100    $      57       -57  %\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023\nand an expense of 1.9% for fiscal year 2022.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, requires taxpayers to capitalize research\nand development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over\nfifteen years.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate includes the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses beginning in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in a greater FDII deduction and significantly\nincreased current taxes, with a corresponding deferred tax benefit at the relevant statutory tax rate.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nincreased tax benefits of the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit,\nrelative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of\nearnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign\nsubsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to\ntax benefits from the FDII deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal\nresearch tax credit.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the FDII deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S.\nfederal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal\nresearch tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         3,389    $        1,990\nMarketable securities                               9,907            19,218\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        13,296    $       21,208\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,\n2023              2022\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         5,641    $        9,108\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $         7,375    $       -9,830\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing    $       -11,617    $        1,865\nactivities\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of\n$7.91 billion from the end of fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to\na decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35\nbillion, and higher tax payments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were\nprimarily driven by lower accounts receivable due to strong collections partially offset by timing of supplier\npayments and inventory deliveries.\nCash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily driven\nby lower purchases and higher sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, due to share\nrepurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in fiscal year 2023, offset by absence of debt repayment.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and cash generated\nby our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.25 billion of debt\nrepayment due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our\naccess to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued\nby highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nRefer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.10 billion to $1.30\nbillion related to property and equipment.\nExcept for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and\nto amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The adverse cash\nflow impact of mandatory capitalization will be reduced in future years as capitalized research and development\nexpenditures continue to amortize. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\nIV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.04 billion in share repurchases and $398 million in quarterly cash\ndividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our\nBoard of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder\nare in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $         1,250\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  4,000\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -47\nNet carrying amount                                      10,953\nLess short-term portion                                  -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                         $         9,703\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

We are unable to reasonably estimate the\ntiming of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in\nthe underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are\ncurrently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

          "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values\nfor these investments of $17 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of\n46\nTable of Contents\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nadditional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United\nStates dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange\nrate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense. The\nimpact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is\nIsraeli Shekel.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29,\n2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n29, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29,\n2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system,\nwhich will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter\nof fiscal year 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included\nupdating our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are\nchanges that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.",

Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\n52\nTable of Contents\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and\nthe Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920\nmillion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)\nthe consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both\n52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to\nwrite off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on\nadvances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage,\nand network equipment from threeto a range of fourto five years, and assembly and test equipment from fiveto seven\nyears. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the\ncarrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of\nthe end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $\n133million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nsold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and\nextended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line\n60\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nattribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized\nusing an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock\npurchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and\nSeptember of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.\nAdditionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of\nforfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a\nloss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate\nthe loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual\nliability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could\nrequire us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets\nand liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.48billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state,\nand certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to\njurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by\ncertain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock\nownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would\nrecognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses\non the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the\nother income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of\navailable-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any,\nis caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely\nthan not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAllowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nidentified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure\nexcludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods\nranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a\nstraight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an\nindefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible\nasset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are\ninherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the\nmeasurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant\n64\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nregulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of\n$ 1.35billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nIn April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to\n65\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nintegration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general\nand administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as\nfollows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized. In fiscal year 2023, we\ncommenced amortization of the IPR&D intangible asset.\nSupplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA\nand Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\nPro Forma\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31, 2021\n-In millions\nRevenue       $            17,104\nNet income    $             4,757\nThe unaudited pro forma information presented above includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired\nintangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and\ntransaction costs.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, or the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 29, 2023, up to 47million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted\nunder the 2007 Plan, of which 2million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All\noptions are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant\nRSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 29, 2023, there were 160million\nshares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued\nservice, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25%\nvesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-\ndetermined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C)\nover a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-\nyearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the\nanniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on\napproximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs\nand market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on\nachievement of pre-determined criteria.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently\namended and restated, or the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock.

The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty activity consisted of\nthe following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,           January 31,\n2023              2022                  2021\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period                    $           46    $           22        $           15\nAdditions                                                    145                    40                    28\nUtilization                                                 -109               -16                   -21\nBalance at end of period                          $           82    $           46        $           22\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recorded $ 122million in product warranty liabilities primarily\nrelated to a defect identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. In the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2023, we recognized a warranty-related benefit of approximately $ 70million in cost of\nrevenue due to favorable product recovery.\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters\nsuch as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions\nin our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated\nbecause many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.\nLitigation\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits\nThe plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on\nDecember 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses,\n79\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincluding attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2,\n2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment\nin favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May\n10, 2022.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading,\nmisappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange\nAct based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n80\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 29, 2023, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 29,\n2023, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIndia, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022.

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that\nprogram are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the\ndeclaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between\nadditional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $\n20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares.\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 227million, $ 168million, and $ 120million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive AI\nCockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing\nplatforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and CMP.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or\nGraphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-\nbased compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs,\nrestructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement costs, contributions, and other\nnon-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment\nreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our\nreportable segments and the “All Other” category.\n84\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nCompute & Networking\nYear Ended January 29, 2023:              (In millions)       Graphics       All Other       Consolidated\nRevenue                         $                15,068    $    11,906    $          —    $        26,974\nOperating income (loss)         $                 5,083    $     4,552    $     -5,411    $         4,224\nYear Ended January 30, 2022:\nRevenue                         $                11,046    $    15,868    $          —    $        26,914\nOperating income (loss)         $                 4,598    $     8,492    $     -3,049    $        10,041\nYear Ended January 31, 2021:\nRevenue                         $                 6,841    $     9,834    $          —    $        16,675\nOperating income (loss)         $                 2,548    $     4,612    $     -2,628    $         4,532\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29,       January 30,       January 31,\n2023              2022              2021\n-In millions\nReconciling items included in \"All\nOther\" category:\nStock-based compensation expense         $        -2,710    $       -2,004    $       -1,397\nAcquisition termination cost                      -1,353                 —                 —\nAcquisition-related and other costs                 -674              -636              -836\nUnallocated cost of revenue and                     -595              -399              -357\noperating expenses\nRestructuring costs and other                        -54                 —                 —\nIP-related and legal settlement costs                -23               -10               -38\nContributions                                         -2                 —                 —\nTotal                                    $        -5,411    $       -3,049    $       -2,628\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the billing location of the customer.\nEnd customer location may be different than our customer’s billing location.
