NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can solve complex\nproblems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches.\nIndeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance\nleaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and software\nlayers. With our acquisition of Mellanox, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures,\npositioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach\nallows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,\nwhich include Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of\nthese end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA\nas the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged\ninvestments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by\nusing a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We\nutilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing\nplatform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs,\ninterconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely\nsuited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our\nleadership\n7\nTable of Contents\nposition. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our\nGPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our\nown AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to\nhelp deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of\nuniversities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program.

We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the\ntransportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms\nrequired for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-\ncoded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full\nfunctionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are\nbringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1\nsuppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural\nnetworks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air\nsoftware updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the\ntransportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our\ncustomers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities\ndirectly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development\narrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-\nperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our\nglobal markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network.

Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for\ndevelopers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that\nleverage our platforms.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAs NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to\nplatforms and complete systems to software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to\ncustomers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to\ncloud service providers and enterprise customers.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers,\nprofessional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half\nof our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for\nnotebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker\nrevenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and\nour revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will\ncontinue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy,\nwhereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified\nby the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and\nassurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated\nwith owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for\nprocurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our\nresources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and\nprovided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\nWe utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung\nElectronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor\nTechnology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd.,\nand Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use\ncontract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture\nour standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We\npurchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology\nCorporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often\nconsign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract\nmanufacturers.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and\nthen ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry\nCo., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong,\nIsrael, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit\nand test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC\nsolutions.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SoCs, and\nother accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance\ninterconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our\n9\nTable of Contents\ncompetitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be\nmore able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the\nfuture.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing\nsolutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\nlarge internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing\nfunctionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\nsuppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as\nAmbarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or\ncompanies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista\nNetworks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as\nwell as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply\nwith such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could\nhave a material impact on our business. On February 8, 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase\nAgreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of\nthe transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance\nwith laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of\noperations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for\nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not\nlimited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs,\nanti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy\nrequirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity,\nenvironmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and\nconsumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\n10\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and\ndiscussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake an annual analysis to ensure that our ESG\npriorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These\nissues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our\nstakeholders.\nThe following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found\non the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility\nReport, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by\nreference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks,\nincluding current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\nIn our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting\nyear being fiscal year 2021, with our fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been\nno material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations or competitive position associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year\n2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for\nour offices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs\nare inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput and\nperformance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately 40x more energy efficient than\ntraditional CPU servers for AI workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong\npresence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the\nNovember 2021 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system\nwill build a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution\nclimate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with\nmore urgency.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and\ndevelopment and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated\nhiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting\ntop talent to NVIDIA.\nWe attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization\naffiliations, industry conferences, community resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our\nemployees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new hires coming from employee referrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include\nworkshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common\n11\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current\nprograms and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and\nadvanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on\ndevelopmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed\nmentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure\nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize\nareas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts\nabout making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\nIn fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour stockholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and\nfinancial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee\nstock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-\nmanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits\nbased on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support\nfor new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those\nhistorically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino\ncandidates.\nOther efforts we have been or are undertaking include:\nExpanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with\nminority-serving institutions and professional organizations;\nSupported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;\nSupported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce\nin the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nHealth and COVID-19\nWe support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022\nand the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and\noffices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also\nmade some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while adhering to government\nguidelines. Steps we took to support employees include:\nProviding work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home\nexpenses;\n12\nTable of Contents\nEnhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental health resources\nand virtual care offerings, and care for those with COVID-19;\nLearning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and\nOpportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.\nWe will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to\nrecharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of March\n11, 2022:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       59    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

          "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not\nlimited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part\nof your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our\nrevenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nOur accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization,\nand Automotive. These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product\nintroductions and enhancements, and industry standards.\nOur strategic and business success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and\ntechnologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\naccurately forecast demand in our businesses;\nmeet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;\nmanage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\ndevelop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support,\ne-commerce and IP licensing capabilities; and\ncomplete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\nWe make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a\nlimited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to\ndevelop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAchieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and\ndepend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in\nindustry standards or disruptive technological innovation could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards,\nour customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design\nwin may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not\nguarantee revenue.\nWe cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our\ncustomers and partners. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology\ntrends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be\nharmed.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCompetition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide\nbetter functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our\nproducts. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger\ncustomer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and\ngreater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more\neffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly\ntransition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-\nconstrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also\nintegrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar\nto ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable\nsuch customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully\ncompete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this\ncompetitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our\nrevenue to decline.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our\nfinancial results could be harmed.\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to\nmarket, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can\nimpact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to\nretailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers\nand distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to\nproperly forecast demand.\nGPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining,\nincluding blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute\ntechnologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new\ncryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in\nthe future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products, and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased\naftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the\ndistribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce\nGPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of\nour LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our\ngaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether\nour strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold\non the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with\nour distribution channels.\nConsumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data\nCenter, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may\ncontinue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside.\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires\nus to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of\nthe worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect\nour demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could\nlead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory.\nDemand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and\ncause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products\nand carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory\npurchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-\ndown our\n15\nTable of Contents\ninventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in\naverage selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand.\nSituations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in\nour target markets and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;\nhigher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nnew product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to\nunexpected end use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nfluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or\ndecrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future\nproducts where we have entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent\nwe are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times and/or before the design of those products is\nfinal.\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate\nlead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders\non a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able\nto increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely\nmanner. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could\nbe damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain,\nas we are in today, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our\nhistorical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example,\nwhile we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, we have begun placing orders at least\ntwelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future\nquarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such\nperiods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and\nfuture demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other\ncharges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is\nserved by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\nWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products,\nwhich reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and\nproduct delivery schedule and could harm our business.\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication\nfacility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and\ntechniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors.\nWe also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of\nnew products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater\nfunctionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for\ncapacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet\ncustomer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and\nadversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\n16\nTable of Contents\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nlimited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory\nmanufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours; and\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology.\nIf our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our\nreputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or\nexperience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging,\nmaterials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices,\nmarkets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may\nonly be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our\nproducts or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious\nsoftware programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to\nspecifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been\nintegrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such\ndefect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product\nrecall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or\nreleases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve\nmarket acceptance, loss of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and\npartners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\nconsumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If a product liability claim is brought\nagainst us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and\nmanagement personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future\ncoverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic\nconditions, which may harm our business.\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested\nand packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal\nyear 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of\nrisks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations, including:\ndomestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\ndiffering legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\ndomestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\ndisruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and\n17\nTable of Contents\nnatural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic\nevents.\nAdverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital\nexpenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence\nand spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee, facilities and\ninfrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have\na material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial\nresults, including:\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;\nour customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\ndifficulties in obtaining capital;\nreduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other\nmanufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;\nlead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect\nour ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions\nand insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\nWe have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and\ncompanies with business in Israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other\ncountries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli\noperations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and\nvendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We\nhave facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind\ncoupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk. These\nmeasures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers,\nincluding impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply\nchain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where\nwe, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience\nhigher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance\ncoverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary\ndepending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our\ninsurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which\ncould harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to\nclimate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and\npollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing\nprocesses or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital\nexpenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as\nwell as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance\ncosts that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by\nincreasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our\n18\nTable of Contents\noperations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the\nimplications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our\nstated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025,\nwhich could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also\nexperience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which\ncould result in increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face\ndecreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy\nefficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of\nour products, could negatively impact our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we\nbelieve will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives.\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our\nbusiness, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial\nresults. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to\nenter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely\ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable\nto pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022,\nNVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the\ncompletion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In\naddition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions\nmay be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they\ncould create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\nRisks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of\nthe acquired business;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or\nstrategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and\napprovals or financing;\nStock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of\nour acquisition or investment.\nSystem security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our\nexpected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or\nimplement adequate preventative measures.\nFor example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our\nnetwork by a group of independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause.\nThe threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and through deception, obtained two-factor authentication\ncapability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA proprietary information,\nincluding NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident,\nwe engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further\nunauthorized access, hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and\nnotified law enforcement and other authorities.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nThreat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to\ncontinue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which\nwe rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we rely on products and services\nprovided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation,\ncloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which\nexposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and\ninfrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not\ncontain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our\nservices. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not\nhave adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a\nsecurity breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their\nsystems, logs and other information related to the security breach.\nTo defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the\nevolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in our\nsecurity controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and\ntechniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may\nexperience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\nBreaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of\nproprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties\naffected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent\nliability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. If we\nor a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security\nincident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting\nrequirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations,\nreputational harm, diversion of funds, financial\n20\nTable of Contents\nloss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell\nand distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower\nmargins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock\nprice and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence,\npolitical and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or\nman-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center\ncapacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical\nbusiness operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations\nvulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these\ngeographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical\ninfrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For\nexample, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our\nemployees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of\nour assets in those regions. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing,\nlogistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water\nshortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental,\npublic health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if\nthe conflict between Russia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our\nfoundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other\nsuppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war\nor catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a\nresult of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume\noperations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating\nresults.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be\nadversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of\nthese partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to\npurchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing\npatterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel,\nchange or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or\ncustomers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our\npartners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of\nwhich may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant\nreduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are\nbeyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost\ninflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse\ntalent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could\nimpair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts,\nor if we cannot retain key employees, our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in\nincreased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a\nresult of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly\ndependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning,\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic\nplanning and execution and long-term success.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation of these processes and systems is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth, including\nfor acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation\nof accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued\nability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These\nchanges may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.\nFailure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remediate any material weakness,\nour financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to\nreport our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital\nmarkets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or\ninvestigation by regulatory authorities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners,\nvendors and suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic\nand demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical services, may have a\nmaterial net negative impact on our business and financial results. While COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales\nfor certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around\nthe world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations\ncould limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity\nand components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary\nlevels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.\nCOVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and\nmay continue to result in, disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price\nand liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting\ndemand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as\nrequired by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.\nThere is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our\nability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we expect to incur\nincremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to\ntimely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of\nglobal supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative\nimpact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though\nthe full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described\nin these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but\nare not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\n22\nTable of Contents\nour ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nthe inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance over the\npurchasing credit extended to these customers, and customer bad debt write-offs;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial\nresults. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could\ncause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption;\nbusiness acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements;\ncompetition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and\nsafety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with\nsuch requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business\noperations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and\nregulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees,\ncontractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help\nensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal\nsanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to\nour reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we\ncould incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and\noperate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in\nanti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from\ngrowing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government\nbodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic\nsanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products,\nprovide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to\nchange from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on\nour business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies\nhave imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control\nmeasures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on\nexports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular\nentities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage\nof our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, and restrict\naccess by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems,\nnegatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United\nStates and foreign government bodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and\nprocedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our employees, contractors,\npartners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be\nultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to\nvarious penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the\nregions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and\nKorea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may\nresult in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions\nthat could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability.\nThe increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory\nrestrictions that target products\n23\nTable of Contents\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings.\nSuch restrictions could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and\nfinancial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nRecent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may\nadversely affect our Gaming business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and\nenforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs,\nrestrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect\non our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and\nservices, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We\nare increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI presents risks and challenges\nthat could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI poses emerging ethical issues and if we enable or\noffer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to\ndevelop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and\nsystems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal\nliability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related\nresearch and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others\ncould undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational\nharm.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities\ncould result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and\nsuppliers to do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants,\nshareholders and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies,\nincluding those associated with climate change and human rights. These parties have placed increased importance on\nthe implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other\nindustry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business\nactivities may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability\ndisclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including\ncorporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management,\nproduct quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that\nstakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur\nadditional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, or\nchoose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing\ncustomers, due to our policies. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any\nsustainability disclosure could have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An\nunfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third\nparties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP\nrights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and\nresolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims\nare made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have\nto seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms\nacceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to\nsubstantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products.\nWe may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not\nconcluded on commercially reasonable\n24\nTable of Contents\nterms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other\nindemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a\nresult, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be\nreduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously\nassess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be\ncertain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able\nto enforce such protections.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our\nproducts and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and\nservices, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information\nthat is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies,\ncontracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our\npractices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security\nor disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded,\ncould damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data\nin our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings,\ndisruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data\nprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nindividuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a\nproposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations and could require us\nto change our business practices.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For\nexample, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European\nCommission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data\nout of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of\nprotection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of doing business. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and\nnegatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to\nEuropean and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing\ncapabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nThe United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows\nfor statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches. California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or\nCPRA, which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use\nof cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of personal information; expand the types of\ndata breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimpose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado\nPrivacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data\nprivacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional\nobligations.\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere\nare quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that\nis\n25\nTable of Contents\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies,\nsystems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our\nefforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or\nare perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face\nsignificant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal\ndata. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax\nrates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll,\nsales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various\nforeign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and\nexpenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for\nincome taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.\nFor example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019\nand under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities\nmay disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase\nour worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or\ninternational tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including\nproposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a\nresult of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in\nfiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the\nTCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures\nover five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision,\nit will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals to increase\nthe U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of\ninternational business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax\nrates. Numerous countries, as well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and\nare considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax\nobligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business, which could\nmaterially impact our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in\njurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the\nresolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles,\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax\npurposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation\nallowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based\ncompensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the\nperiod in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in\nthe United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the\ndomestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of\nlimitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple\nshareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or\nfines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and\noverall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our\noperations. Our business is subject to laws and\n26\nTable of Contents\nregulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with\nchanges in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior\nnotes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to\nrefinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the\nnotes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial\npaper program.\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us\nto dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal\nrepayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability\nto obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other\npurposes; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected\nby events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or\nlenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating\nagency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability\nto obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or\nprevent a change in control.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions\nthat could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These\nprovisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of\ndirectors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our\nshareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director\nnominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell\ngraphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the\nagreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11,\n2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nOn July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, such that each stockholder of record\nat the close of business on June 21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every\nshare held on the record date, or the Stock Split. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related\nshareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a\ntotal cost of $7.08 billion through January 30, 2022.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share\nrepurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nfactors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may\nbe suspended at any time at our discretion.\nWe did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. As of January 30, 2022, we are authorized, subject to\ncertain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of all existing 349\nmillion treasury shares. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the retirement of our treasury shares.\nRestricted Stock Unit Share Withholding\nWe withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the\nvesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2022, we\nwithheld approximately 8 million shares for a total value of $1.90 billion through net share settlements. Beginning\nwith the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in\ncapital, with withheld shares assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares.

          "content": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, AR and\nVR.\nOur two operating segments are \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September\n2020.\nDemand\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions,\ncompetitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and\nvolume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital\ncurrency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact\nof cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and\nnew cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand, and further impact\ndemand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards\nand processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for\nEthereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs,\nincrease returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have\nintroduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to\naddress demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly\nall our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to\ngamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our\ngaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-\nmining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired\noutcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for\nus to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more\npronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating\ntrends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\nSupply\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires\nus to make estimates of customers’ future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between\nsupply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more\nuncertain. To\n30\nTable of Contents\nhave shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build finished products\nand maintain inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, anticipating demand that does not\nmaterialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. During fiscal year 2022, we made substantial strides in\nbroadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. We expect to remain supply-\nconstrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. We have placed non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. Ordering product in\nadvance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or\nother charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is\nserved by our competitors. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may\ndisappear. Given our current long lead times, we may order components before our product design is finalized and\nchanges to the product design or end demand could trigger excess inventory. Our supply deliveries and production\nmay be non-linear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash flows.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022. Most of our employees continue to work remotely and we\nhave paused most business travel. During fiscal year 2022, our Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization\nmarket platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our\nProfessional Visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as enterprises support\nhybrid work environments. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume\nonsite services and related in-office costs.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain,\nlogistical services and component supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative\nimpact on our business and financial results.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper\narrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt\nrepayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations.\nFiscal Year 2022 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,          January 31,\n2022                 2021       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                          26,914       $       16,675               Up 61%\nGross margin                                                 64.9  %              62.3  %            Up 260 bps\nOperating expenses              $                           7,434       $        5,864               Up 27%\nIncome from operations          $                          10,041       $        4,532               Up 122%\nNet income                      $                           9,752       $        4,332               Up 125%\nNet income per diluted share    $                            3.85       $         1.73               Up 123%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2022 was $26.91 billion, up 61% from a year ago.\nGaming revenue was up 61% from a year ago reflecting higher sales of GeForce GPUs. We continue to benefit from\nstrong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal\nyear 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new\ngames supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand\nfor new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in\ncryptocurrency mining.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAlthough nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to\ngamers, our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency\nusing our GPUs, although we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility\nin the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying\ntransactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability\nto accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is\nlikely to have in the future.\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across\nboth training and inference for cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep\nrecommender models.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture\nproducts and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in\nworkloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in\nlegacy cockpit revenue.\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for\nthe fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.\nRevenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to\nestimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above,\nis likely to have on future CMP sales.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-\nrelated charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins\nalso benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation,\ncompensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share\nwere $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nAt our November 2021 GPU Technology Conference, we announced general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise;\n65 new and updated software development kits, including NVIDIA Riva, Modulus, ReOpt, Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara\nHoloscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge\nAI and autonomous machines.\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series\nGPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA\nDLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\nIn our Data Center platform, we launched new NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs for mainstream AI, data analytics and\ngraphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our\nfirst Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command\nand Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to\naddressing the global climate change crisis.\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop\nworkstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual\nworlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIn our Automotive platform, we unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan next-generation SOC; announced design wins with\nMercedes-Benz for the AI cockpit in its new EQS sedan; with Volvo Cars for the autonomous driving computer in its\nnext-generation cars, beginning with the XC90 in 2022; with energy vehicles from R-Auto, IM Motors, NIO, Faraday\nFuture, VinFast and Xpeng; with robotaxis including Cruise, Amazon Zoox, Pony.ai and AutoX; with autonomous\ntrucking companies Embark, Kodiak Robotics and Plus; formed a multi-year partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to\njointly develop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled services and experiences;\nand announced that Desay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform to manufacture\nsafe and secure AV systems for vehicle makers.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments\ncompared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for\nexisting products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer\ndemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer\npurchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\nan unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor\ncompany, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so,\nwe must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of\ncustomers’ future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our\nhistorical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to\nother market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions,\nand macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is\n33\nTable of Contents\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the\nstandalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a\nperformance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if\nindicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment\nreview process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill\nallocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion,\nrespectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of\nsignificant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities\nto each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but\nthat are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal\nyear 2021 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             35.1              37.7\nGross profit                                64.9              62.3\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development                    19.6              23.5\nSales, general and administrative            8.0              11.6\nTotal operating expenses                    27.6              35.1\nIncome from operations                      37.3              27.2\nInterest income                              0.1               0.3\nInterest expense                            -0.9              -1.1\nOther, net                                   0.4               0.1\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.4              -0.7\nIncome before income tax expense            36.9              26.5\nIncome tax expense                           0.7               0.5\nNet income                                  36.2  %           26.0  %\n35\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,            $         %\n2022              2021       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nGraphics                $          15,868    $        9,834    $   6,034        61  %\nCompute & Networking               11,046             6,841        4,205        61  %\nTotal                   $          26,914    $       16,675    $  10,239        61  %\nGraphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue\nto benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue\nduring fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the\nrelease of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and\nstreaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end\nusers to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\nCompute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal\nyear 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud\ncomputing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical\nindustries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and\nthat fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the\nlocation to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a\ndifferent location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal\nyear 2022 was primarily due to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory\nstep-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within\nGraphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years\n2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of\n0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021,\nprimarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs.\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year\n2021, primarily due to a shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive\nsolutions.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,          January 31,               $         %\n2022                 2021          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           5,268       $        3,924       $   1,344        34  %\n% of net revenue                                  19.6  %              23.5  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,166                1,940             226        12  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   8.0  %              11.6  %\nTotal operating expenses             $           7,434       $        5,864       $   1,570        27  %\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily\ndriven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher\ninfrastructure costs.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021,\nprimarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially\noffset by lower amortization of intangibles.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income\nwas $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was\nprimarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nInterest expense was $236 million and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in\nexpense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated\nentities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during\nfiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains\nfrom our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our\ninvestments in non-affiliated entities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our\nannual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S.\nfederal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction,\nand the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the\nBritish Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess\ntax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time\nbenefits of the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to\nincome earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was\nlower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax\nbenefits related to stock-based compensation.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information, including the Domestication.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         1,990    $          847\nMarketable securities                              19,218            10,714\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        21,208    $       11,561\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         9,108    $        5,822\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $        -9,830    $      -19,675\nactivities\nNet cash provided by financing              $         1,865    $        3,804\nactivities\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of\n$9.65 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net\nincome, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by\nprepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher\nrevenue.\nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021,\nreflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021,\nand higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable\nsecurities.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021,\nwhich primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock\nunits.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash\ngenerated by our operations. As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional supply. We\ncontinuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we\ncan finance our future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and\nits agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These\nmarketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to\nproperty and equipment.\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for\nwhich we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than\nthat, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of\nJanuary 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nFollowing the Domestication, we\n38\nTable of Contents\nhave utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in\nhigher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA\nrequires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over\nfive years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in\nsignificantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year\n2022.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding:\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;\n$1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030;\n$1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031;\n$1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040;\n$2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and\n$500 million of Notes Due 2060.\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 30, 2022, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million\nrecorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing\nof any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the\nunderlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently\nunder examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation.\nFor a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12,\nNote 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, respectively.\nClimate Change\nRefer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate\nGovernance activities. To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with\nglobal sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business\ntrends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are monitoring potential\nregulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other\njurisdictions. We believe that climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not\nexperienced any significant physical effects of climate change to date on our operations and results, nor any\nsignificant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build Earth-2, an AI\nsupercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy\nCredits.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.",

          "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis,\nparallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor,\nwould result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for\nthese investments of $22 million, respectively.\nAt January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less\nunamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no\nfinancial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of\nforeign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years\n2022 and 2021.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset\na corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30,\n2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n30, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30,\n2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system,\nwhich will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nthe Company’s financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the\nconsolidated financial reporting and general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate\neach quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.",

Exhibits\nThe exhibits listed in the accompanying index to exhibits are filed or incorporated by          81\nreference as a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n44\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of\ncomprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nJanuary 30, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under\nItem 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory\nprovisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess\ninventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including\ndeveloping assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over\nmanagement’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating\nthe appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the\napproach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market\nconditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating\nwhether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including\nhistorical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in\ntechnology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nMarch 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND

Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of\nthe software, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to\nsubscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services\nbased on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we\nestimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or\nsubstantial\n53\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nsettlement payments or judgements. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any\nof our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss\nassociated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in\nany such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to\nrecord additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary\nassets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary\nassets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses\nrelated to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses\nfrom foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date\nhave not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907million related to state and certain other deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of\n54\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\ntax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the\nsale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other\nincome (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair\nvalue of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more\nlikely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost\nbasis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it\ncreates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for\nnoncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts\nconsistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are\nnot limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable\nmultiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates\nregarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods\nranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a\nstraight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an\nindefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible\nasset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nto determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to\none year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with\nthe corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the\nfair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded\nto our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an\nacquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance\nwith Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting\nstandard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $ 1.36billion charge in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September\n2020.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nIn April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing,\nstorage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the\nentire computing, networking, and storage stack.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration.\nAcquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as\nfollows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox has an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized. Instead, the project is\ntested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be\nimpaired or may have reached technological feasibility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, or the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 30, 2022, up to 50million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted\nunder the 2007 Plan, of which 6million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All\noptions are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant\nRSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131million\nshares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to\ncontinued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant\nand 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40%\nvesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly\nthereafter. PSUs vest over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined\ndate that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based\nPSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares\nsubject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation\nCommittee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently\namended and restated, or the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately\n24months, which is generally divided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased\nunder our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the\ncommencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within\nthe offering. As of January 30, 2022, we had 233million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, January 31, 2021                                                     59    $                  66.17\nGranted                                                                        18    $                 190.69\nVested restricted stock                                                       -29    $                  66.67\nCanceled and forfeited                                                         -2    $                  86.47\nBalances, January 30, 2022                                                     46    $                 114.19\nVested and expected to vest after                                              46    $                 113.84\nJanuary 30, 2022\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, there were 131million and 148million shares, respectively, of common\nstock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $\n1.38billion, with an average exercise price of $ 3.55per share and an average remaining term of 1.1years.

These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains\nor losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to\noperating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nThe fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.

The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral\nargument is scheduled for May 10, 2022.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation , was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but\nstated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action\nis resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements\nrelated to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA\nCorporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading,\nmisappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange\nAct based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n72\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal                  $           482    $          197    $           65\nState                                 42                 1                 4\nForeign                               71               161                87\nTotal current                        595               359               156\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal                             -420              -246                 2\nForeign                               14               -36                16\nTotal deferred                      -406              -282                18\nIncome tax expense       $           189    $           77    $          174\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nDomestic (1)                $         8,446    $        1,437    $          620\nForeign                               1,495             2,972             2,350\nIncome before income tax    $         9,941    $        4,409    $        2,970\n(1) Fiscal year 2022 domestic income before income tax increased as compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 due to\nthe Domestication in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of\n21% to income before income taxes as follows:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nTax expense computed at federal           $         2,088    $          926    $          624\nstatutory rate\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal tax                 42                10                12\neffect\nForeign-derived intangible income                    -520                 —                 —\nForeign tax rate differential                        -497              -561              -301\nStock-based compensation                             -337              -136               -60\nU.S. federal R&D tax credit                          -289              -173              -110\nIP domestication                                     -244                 —                 —\nOther                                                 -54                11                 9\nIncome tax expense                        $           189    $           77    $          174\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are presented below:\nJanuary 30,       January 31,\n2022              2021\n-In millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nResearch and other tax credit           $           798    $          650\ncarryforwards\nProperty, equipment and intangible                  530                32\nassets\nGILTI deferred tax assets                           378               709\nAccruals and reserves, not currently                258                59\ndeductible for tax purposes\nOperating lease liabilities                         125               120\nNet operating loss carryforwards                    118               100\nStock-based compensation                             86                36\nOther deferred tax assets                            22                 —\nGross deferred tax assets                         2,315             1,706\nLess valuation allowance                           -907              -728\nTotal deferred tax assets                         1,408               978\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquired intangibles                               -169              -191\nUnremitted earnings of foreign                     -150              -111\nsubsidiaries\nOperating lease assets                             -113              -111\nGross deferred tax liabilities                     -432              -413\nNet deferred tax asset (1)              $           976    $          565\n(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 1.22billion and $ 806million and long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities of $ 245million and $ 241million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $ 189million, $ 77million, and $ 174million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and\n2020 respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was\nprimarily due to an\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S.\nfederal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and\nthe discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared\nto fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States\ntax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP\nto the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more\nclosely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax\nlaws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit\nprimarily from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 244million in fiscal\nyear 2022.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the\nBritish Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess\ntax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time\nbenefits of the Domestication.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the\ntax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the\nacquisition, we recorded $ 256million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over\nthe tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also\nrecorded $ 153million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.05billion and $ 232million of\ncumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We\nhave not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these\ninvestments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907million and $ 728million,\nrespectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 397million, $\n345million and $ 341million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year\n2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 341million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of\nJanuary 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 102million that will begin to expire in\nfiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.24billion, of which $ 1.18billion is\nattributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 55million is attributable to\nvarious other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other\nauthoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign\nnet operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and\nother limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such\nlimitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable,\nmay expire or be denied before utilization.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $ 1.01billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 808million would affect\nour effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 181million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state\nincome tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that\nwould likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 808million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January\n30, 2022 consisted of $ 670million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $ 138million reflected as a net\nreduction to the deferred tax assets.\n75\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nJanuary 30,       January 31,       January 26,\n2022              2021              2020\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period            $           776    $          583    $          477\nIncreases in tax positions for current                246               158               104\nyear\nIncreases in tax positions for prior                   14                60                 7\nyears (1)\nDecreases in tax positions for prior                   -4               -11                 —\nyears\nSettlements                                            -8                -5                 —\nLapse in statute of limitations                       -11                -9                -5\nBalance at end of period                  $         1,013    $          776    $          583\n(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the\nMellanox acquisition.\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we\nanticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt\nof cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of\nJanuary 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $ 59million, $ 44million, and $ 31million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 670million\nand the related interest and penalties of $ 59million are included in non-current income taxes payable.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on\nsuch tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 30,\n2022, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIndia, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2021. As of January 30,\n2022, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India,\nIsrael, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nThrough January 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04billion shares under our share repurchase program\nfor a total cost of $ 7.08billion. As of January 30, 2022, we have a remaining authorization, subject to certain\nspecifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24billion through December 2022. From January\n31, 2022 through March 17, 2022, we repurchased 7.7million shares of our common stock for $ 1.75billion.\nDuring fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $ 399million, $ 395million, and $ 390million in cash dividends to\nour shareholders, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of our existing\n349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The\nexcess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings,\nresulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $ 20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any\nfuture repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.\n76\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 168million, $ 120million, and $ 76million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and\nOmniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\nOur Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;\nMellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements,\nand autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nand other software.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &\nNetworking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include\nstock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related\ncosts, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment.
