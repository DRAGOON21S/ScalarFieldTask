There has been no material impact to\nour capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental\nsustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025,\nour goal is to purchase\n10\nTable of Contents\nor generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we increased the percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases\nto 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3\ncategory 1 GHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it\nis optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products\nis evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered\n24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will\nenable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate\nchange and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were\nengaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative\npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\nrelating to human capital management.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and\nhave been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong\nemployer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce\nis 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting,\nresulting in an increase in global female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent,\nwith over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee referrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted\ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand\nlearning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We create learning paths\nfocused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are\nexposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to\nsubsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide\none-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed\nmentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure\nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party\nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that\nwe can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their\nthoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect\nthe identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive\nresponses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come\nand stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall turnover rate was 2.7%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and\nfinancial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside\nthe U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies to address mental health,\nstress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable\nsupport across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of\nour Community Resource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to\nbecome parents.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing\nteam of world-class talent and their families.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline\nthat includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and\nHispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\nEmbedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the\ninterview process and find internal opportunities;\nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;\nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for\ndiversity;\nTrack equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of\nour workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nFlexible Working Environment\nWe support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under\ncertain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe\nmakes NVIDIA a great place to work.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days\noff a quarter for employees to rest and recharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages, and positions as of\nFebruary 16, 2024:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       60    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

The following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which\ncould cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or\nthat we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or\nreputation.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry may adversely impact our financial results.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and could\ndamage our business.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n13\nTable of Contents\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nProduct, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect\nour financial condition, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets.\nA significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to end customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented\nfrom selling to any of these end customers.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees.\nModification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, and\ninternal controls.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results\nare below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely\nimpact our business.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices\ncould result in financial, reputational, or operational harm and liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial\nharm and liability.\nAdequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are\nunsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other\nobligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or\nregulatory proceedings and liability.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates,\nchanges in tax laws, and other tax-related factors.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory proceedings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nDelaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nFailure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive\nproducts, and industry standards.\nOur success depends on our ability to:\ntimely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products\nand technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry\nstandards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products\ndeveloped by other companies;\n14\nTable of Contents\ndevelop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;\nlaunch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as\nsoftware-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;\nexpand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\nmeet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance\nstandards;\nmanage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;\ndevelop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our\nbusiness, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations,\ncustomer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and\ncomplete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities.\nWe have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not\nproduce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and\ntechnologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining\ndesign wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and\nfunctionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may\nprevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and\ntechnologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key\nsuccess criteria, our financial results may be harmed.\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners,\nwhich include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI\nFoundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services\nin their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support\nthese offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services\nhas changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer\nstandalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other\nsoftware solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any\nmeaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant\nrevenue from these offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and\nservice offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products,\nservices and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or\nprovide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-\nexpected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and\nhave longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections,\nmore design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors\nmay be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon\nopportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our\nability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment,\nwhich could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities\nsimilar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example,\nothers may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to\nestablish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and\nwe may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are\nnot provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-\nlinear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the\npast, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product\nshortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial\nresults.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past\nentered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure\nsufficient\n15\nTable of Contents\ncommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These\nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new\nsuppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Additionally, our\nability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products\nare not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of\nshortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead\ntimes on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead\ntimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity,\nwhich have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale\ntheir capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require\nadditional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our\nrevenue declines.\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our\ncustomers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products\nand impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud\nservices;\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\nthe demand for our products; or\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on\ngaming usage.\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are\ngathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new\ndata center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with\nexisting suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These\nincreased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may\ncreate more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements.\nOur purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024\nwere impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving,\nand demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand\nindications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in\nthe past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior\narchitecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due\nto our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our\nData Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product\nlaunch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions\nmay magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times.\nQualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing\nchannel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation\narchitectures when customers anticipate\n16\nTable of Contents\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future\narchitecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our\nfinancial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\nmay result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions,\nwarranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional\nchallenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of\ncustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have\npreviously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs,\nODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple\nOEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market\nconditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to\nimpact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various\ndownstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-\ntime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a\ntimely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a\ntimely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient\nsupply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer\nrelationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nAdditionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or\navailability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose\nto purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase\ncommitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel\npricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of\nfuture demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products\nin the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments\nand may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-\nreturnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to\nmake changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase\nas our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater\nportion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for\nnew use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels,\nand we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent\ntechnologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data\nCenter, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and\napplications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative\nAI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product\nofferings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to\nadequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and\nregional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural\ndisasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China,\nwhich comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and\nassembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use\ncases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent\nspikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital\ncurrencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past\nor current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in\ncryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining\nand demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to\ncryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced\nand may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create\nincreased aftermarket sales of our\n17\nTable of Contents\nGPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our\nnew products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also\nmakes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products\nand distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain\naccelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and\npublishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers,\nand other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by\nthird-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use\nby our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We\ndo not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These\nsubcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face several risks\nwhich have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply\nchain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business\noperations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and\ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient\nquantities or in a timely manner;\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of\nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies,\nincluding transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and\nmemory designs needed to manufacture our products;\nfailure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and\ntest providers and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products\nwithout our qualification;\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply\nin advance;\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process\ntechnology; and\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes,\nfires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage\nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future\ncontain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number\nof issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may increase\nas our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are\nreleased. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used\nin our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products we or our\npartners offer rely on\n18\nTable of Contents\ntraining data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may\ncontain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component\nproviders may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the\ncustomer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services\nhave been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or\nexpose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could\nattack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to\nsubstantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive\nmanufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to\nincur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise,\nwrite-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from\nour product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely\nor satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after\ncommencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins,\ntemporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and\nprospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact\nour business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our\ncustomers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection\nwith indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data\nCenter products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and\nsupply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net\nwarranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have\naccurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our\nestimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought\nagainst us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our\nsupply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical\nand management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or\nfuture coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency\nfluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT\ninfrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global\nsupply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the\nfuture have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively\nimpacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which\nhave reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’\ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers,\nlicensing parties or other third parties we rely on;\nreduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for\nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances\namong other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets,\nreduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial\ninstitutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or\nspeculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions,\nwhich could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to\nfulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are\nsubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns\nor events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio\ncomprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit\nrating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an\nunrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could\nharm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States. Our\nsales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal\nyear 2024. Although we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have\nstarted to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage\nof our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we\nexpect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business\nsubjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and\ninternational economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do\nbusiness, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards\nwith respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and\ncultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural\ndisasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,\nreduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-\nattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against\nthem or implement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be\nlimited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported\nactors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally,\nsome actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical\nconflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable\nto a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products.\nWe may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other\nthird-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,\ncontractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our\nsecurity policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,\nsecurity incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security\npolicies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us.\nFurthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical\nbusiness systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication\ntechnology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business\ndisruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply\nchains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that\ncould result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and\nservices, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate\nthird-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. These datasets may be\nflawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents.\nWe may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our\nAI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may\nnot have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers\na security incident (which has happened in the\n20\nTable of Contents\npast and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct\naccess to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are\nincorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or\nservices are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could\nresult in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and\nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our\nsecurity measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers\nhave appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our\ncustomers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and\nsecurity awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have\nidentified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security\ncontrols, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques\nchange frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience\ndelays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These\nvulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could\nresult in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and\ncustomers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose\nus and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation\nand subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm,\nincluding financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners\nin our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our\npartners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to\npotential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has\noccurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\nconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,\nrestrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds,\ndiversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar\nharms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicable data privacy and security\nobligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators\nand investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water\nshortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or\ncivil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and\nother natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our\ncurrent data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California,\nand other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia,\nmaking our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions\noccurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who\nprovide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political\ninstability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in\nwhich we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical\ntensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the\nmanufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing\nregulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product\ndemand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support\noperations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations\ncould be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any\nreason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology\nsystem failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or\npolitical issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects\nus, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of\ndeclines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nAll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year\n2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with\nthe conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may\ncontinue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience\nany significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact\nfuture product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third\nparties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of\nthese parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase\nour reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects,\ndisruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water\navailability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our\nproducts and services.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors.\nWater and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of\nour facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry\nconditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse\nimplications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability\nof our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure\nworldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and\nother risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our\npolicies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay\na claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits,\nsustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs,\nincluding costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in\nmanufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance\nand energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter\nour operations and product design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we\nmay face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could\nharm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience\ncontractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result\nin increased litigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could\nbe negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much\nmore energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new\nproducts or sell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and\ntechnologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments\ninvolve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or\nsell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular\ntransaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other\nstrategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in\nobtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain\ncritical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other\nchanges can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition,\nto the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been\n22\nTable of Contents\nharmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly\ntraded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\nIn addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives\nand to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining\ntheir strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time\nof our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in\nwhich we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our\ninvestment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry\nsectors could increase our impairment losses. We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic\ninvestments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; difficulty\nin realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic\ninvestment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or\nother consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\nand potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in\nwhich we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating\nand retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an\nacquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense,\nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to\nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products,\ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and\ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our\nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a\nconcentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely\naffected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which\nwas attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling\nmultiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within\nour partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In\nthe future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their\necosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a\npurchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little\nnotice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets\nfor which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of\nour customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,\ndistributors and other channel partners. One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through\nsystem integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately\n19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the\n23\nTable of Contents\nCompute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated\nnear a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase\ntheir credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a\nsignificant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’\ntrade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external\nfactors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and\nleaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in\ntheir administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nCompetition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times\nof stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value\nof our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our\nlongstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term\nsuccess.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment\nof internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient\noperation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design\nand implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any\nERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an\nimpact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our\nfinancial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial\ndemands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may\ncause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any\nmaterial weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material\nweakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the\ncapital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation\nby regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk\nfactors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future\nperformance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required\npayments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt\nwrite-offs;\nour vendors' payment requirements;\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example,\nwe have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during\nmacroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may\ncontinue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the\ncash we have available for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses\nand investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be\nsustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely\nto cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and\npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but\nnot limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations;\ncybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our\ncompetitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our\nproducts. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance\nwith such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules\nand regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to\nmaterially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply\nour products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes\nor increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in\nour business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and\nChina. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and\ncompetition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition\nin those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United\nKingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our\ninvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to\nreceive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing\nrestrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI.\nIf implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt\ndeployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively\nimpacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and\nenforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have\nan adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public\nperception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business\nand results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign\ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and\nrestrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade\nbarriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity\nList or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill\nour contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have\nviolated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation\noccurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic\nsanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia,\nBelarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business\noperations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory\nrestrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result\nin additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns\nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in\nunilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying\nLLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users\nworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively\nimpact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or\ntechnology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors\nassociated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control\nrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls\nrestricting GPUs and associated\n25\nTable of Contents\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have\nbeen and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all\ncustomers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our\nmanufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our\nability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are\nincreasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products,\nor services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage\nfor us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and\nsemiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to\nadditional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business\nand financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA\nAI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide\nservices to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve\ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export\ncontrols has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting\ncompetitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the\nexport control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and\nmaterially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our\nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export\ncontrols could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or\nmultilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the\nability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\nAdditional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to\nprovide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our\nrevenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our\nfulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that\nwe have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to\nvarious penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and\nadverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing\nrequirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of\ncertain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture\ncertain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100\nintegrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and\nchip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for\ncertain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also\ninformed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to,\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements\nalso apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with\nan ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us\nthat the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply\nand distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming,\nand adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue,\nduring any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new\nsolutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To\nthe extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the\ncustomer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is\noffered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept.\nThe USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for\nreview. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports\nof products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming\nand resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\n26\nTable of Contents\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new\nrestrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position\nhas been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if\nthere are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or\nproduct scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own\ninternal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the\nUSG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur\nsignificant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or\nimpose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing\nrequirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives\nto our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions\nto limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by\nimposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip\ntracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are\ndetected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\ncontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and\ndistribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and\nEurope. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products,\nwhich are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter\nGPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may\nalso impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the\nability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a\nwider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against\ncertain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export\ncontrols have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to\n“design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to\nensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged\nand may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors\nrather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,\nexcessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China,\nbut also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls\nincrease the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready\nfor market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such\ncontrols may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S.\ncontrols.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to\ngames may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely\naffect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of\nour products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese\ngovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron,\na supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners,\nespecially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components,\nparts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could\nresult in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers\nto do business with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and\ngovernment regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including\nthose associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate\nsustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-\nlevel initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’\nexpectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure\ncontrols may not meet evolving shareholder,\n27\nTable of Contents\nregulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or\nreporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and\ncomply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or\ndiscontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm\nour brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in\nreputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services\nmay result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues.\nWe are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also\noffer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw\ncontroversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended\nconsequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective\ninternal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered\nthrough our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.\nComplying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain\nproducts and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with\nexisting and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as\nunder any U.S. regulation adopted in response to the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also\nincrease the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency\nrequirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify\nthe USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could\ndisproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively\nimpact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the\nresponsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our\nproducts and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP\nrights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could\ninclude significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost\nprofits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless\nof their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they\nmay also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to\ninfringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP\nrights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could\nbe subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of\nour products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these\narrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our\ntechnology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result,\nthe value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We\nalso may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where\nto seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our\napplications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations.\nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or\nresult in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws,\nregulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the\nprocessing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products\nand services with regard\n28\nTable of Contents\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters,\nincluding for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to\nour reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs\nrelated to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years,\nnumerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,\nincluding providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning\ntheir personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain\npersonal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and\nautomated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products\nand services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including\nsensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory\nfines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access,\ndelete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how\nit is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and the law created a\nprivate right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as\nwell as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related\nto the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to\nadditional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning\ndata protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European\nEconomic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of\npersons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to\ncomply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and\nclasses of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact\nand disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to\nthe United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border\npersonal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries\noutside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities\nto validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to\nprovide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data\nTransfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which\nallows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the\nFramework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States.\nHowever, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on\nthese measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which\nwould increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example,\nChina’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as\nimportant under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior\nassessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements,\nincluding CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent\nus from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to\nimport personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit\nour ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security\nlaws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant\nexpense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for\nallegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply\nwith such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy\nlaws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their\nservice providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or\naltered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory\naction, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with\ncertain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies,\nmaterials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative\nof our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse\nconsequences.\n29\nTable of Contents\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our\nproduct design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any\nthird parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may\nfail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data\nprivacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government\nenforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal\ndata, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes\nin tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other\ntax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe\nour tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the\namount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net\nincome, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could\nincrease our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of\noperations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a\nsignificant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S.\ntax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net\nincome and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions\ncould arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and\nPillar Two Model Rules announced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and\nother changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect\nour provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives,\ncredits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to\nincome taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates\nof our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of\nexisting laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the\ndomestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting\nfor stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in\nthe period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-\nbased compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands\nand/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.\nFor example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we\nand certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from\nmanufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies,\nsuch as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse\nimpact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of\nsenior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to\nrefinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect\nour financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a\nsubstantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our\nflexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and\nrestrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially\nchange our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we\nbreach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness\nmay be declared\n30\nTable of Contents\nimmediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our\nsecurities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a\nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to\ncreate and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without\nprior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting\nrequirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with\nMicrosoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock,\nMicrosoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent\na change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.",

          "content": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\nfields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions,\nscientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are\ngathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new\ndata center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with\nexisting suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These\nincreased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may\ncreate more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing\ncapacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may\ncontinue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving,\nand demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand\nindications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into\nlong-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to\naddress our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten\nour product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our\nsupply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and\nour channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are\nalmost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization,\nand Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and\ndiverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated\nwith managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of\nnew product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and\ncomplexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory\nprovisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates\nadditional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact\nthe timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions\nand have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may\nimpair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX\nCloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases,\napplications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not\nbe able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such\nas generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term\ntrajectory is unknown.\n34\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain\nexceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated\ncircuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\nperformance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements\nalso apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with\nan ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us\nthe licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to\n14% in fiscal year 2024.\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center\nproduct portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance\nnotice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China\nrepresented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due\nto USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year\n2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license\nfor the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the\nlicense application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in\nthe long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance\nof AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any\ntime and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements,\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\nincluding the Middle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply\nchain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our\nresults of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these\nmacroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital\nequipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-\nterm changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our\nvendors.\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\nhealth and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year\n2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with\nthe conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may\ncontinue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience\nany significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact\nfuture product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year 2024 Summary\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024          Jan 29, 2023       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                        60,922       $        26,974               Up 126%\nGross margin                                               72.7  %               56.9  %            Up 15.8 pts\nOperating expenses              $                        11,329       $        11,132               Up 2%\nOperating income                $                        32,972       $         4,224               Up 681%\nNet income                      $                        29,760       $         4,368               Up 581%\nNet income per diluted share    $                         11.93       $          1.74               Up 586%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer\ninternet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare.\nCustomers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data\nCenter compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the\nnormalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%.\nAutomotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving\nplatforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory\nprovisions as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating expenses increased for fiscal year 2024, driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Fiscal\nyear 2023 also included a $1.4 billion acquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we\nlaunched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and\nNVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX\nCloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI\nmodels. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA’s\nautomotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately\n40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers\nrepresented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers.\nWe announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the\nGeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. We announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud\nEngine for Games, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform\ngames and launched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. Additionally, we released TensorRT-LLM for Windows and launched\nGeForce RTX 40-Series SUPER GPUs. Gaming reached a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games and applications utilizing\nNVIDIA DLSS, ray tracing and other NVIDIA RTX technologies.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.6 billion, up 1% from fiscal year 2023. In\nProfessional Visualization, we announced new GPUs based on the NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace architecture, and announced\nNVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, for the development and deployment of\nindustrial metaverse applications.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 21% from fiscal year 2023. In Automotive, we announced\na partnership with MediaTek, which will develop mainstream automotive systems on chips for global OEMs integrating\na new NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics. We furthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-\ngeneration\n36\nTable of Contents\nelectric vehicles, and announced further adoption of NVIDIA DRIVE platform with BYD, XPENG, GWM, Li Auto, ZEEKR and\nXiaomi.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related\ndisclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nestimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We\nhave critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory\nprovisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management\njudgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\nour products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product\nintroductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate\ncustomer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of\nchanges in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\nCancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an\nunfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead\ntimes and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond\ntwelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in\nadvance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We\nalso adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product\ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application\nof complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added\ncertainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign\njurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities\nfor potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\nadditional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional\nincome tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return\nrights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of\nprior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns\nfor credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue\nand accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs\ninclude distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which\nrequire judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals\ninclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and\nexternal factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to\ndate as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each\nproject includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs\nas applicable.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration\nor interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance\nobligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone\nselling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not\nsell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other\nobservable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in\ntechnology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network\nequipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to\nseven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million\nfor cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\nmillion and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal\nyear 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\nRevenue                                     100.0  %           100.0  %\nCost of revenue                              27.3               43.1\nGross profit                                 72.7               56.9\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development                     14.2               27.2\nSales, general and administrative             4.4                9.1\nAcquisition termination cost                    —                5.0\nTotal operating expenses                     18.6               41.3\nOperating income                             54.1               15.6\nInterest income                               1.4                1.0\nInterest expense                             -0.4               -1.0\nOther, net                                    0.4               -0.1\nOther income (expense), net                   1.4               -0.1\nIncome before income tax                     55.5               15.5\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                  6.6               -0.7\nNet income                                   48.9  %            16.2  %\nReportable Segments\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended                               $         %\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $          47,405    $        15,068    $  32,337       215  %\nGraphics                           13,517             11,906        1,611        14  %\nTotal                   $          60,922    $        26,974    $  33,948       126  %\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended                               $         %\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nCompute & Networking    $          32,016    $         5,083    $  26,933       530  %\nGraphics                            5,846              4,552        1,294        28  %\nAll Other                          -4,890             -5,411          521       -10  %\nTotal                   $          32,972    $         4,224    $  28,748       681  %\nCompute & Networking revenue – The year-on-year increase was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute grew 266%\ndue to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs,\nrecommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of\nInfiniBand.\nGraphics revenue – The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to\npartners following the normalization of channel inventory levels.\nReportable segment operating income – The year-on-year increase in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating\nincome was driven by higher revenue.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAll Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost\nin fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year\n2024.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to\nend customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of\nthe United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public\nsector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors.\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to\nthe Compute & Networking segment.\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including\nthrough Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024,\nattributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device\ncosts, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield\nfallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year\nincrease was primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a\npercentage of revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024\nand 2023. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted\nin a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net\neffect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended                                     $         %\nJan 28, 2024          Jan 29, 2023          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           8,675       $         7,339       $   1,336        18  %\n% of net revenue                                  14.2  %               27.2  %\nSales, general and administrative                2,654                 2,440             214         9  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                   4.4  %                9.1  %\nAcquisition termination cost                         —                 1,353          -1,353      -100  %\n% of net revenue                                     —  %                5.0  %\nTotal operating expenses             $          11,329       $        11,132       $     197         2  %\n% of net revenue                                  18.6  %               41.3  %\nThe increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year\n2024 was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee\ngrowth and compensation increases.\nAcquisition Termination Cost\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended                               $\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Change\n-$ in millions\nInterest income                $             866    $           267    $     599\nInterest expense                            -257               -262            5\nOther, net                                   237                -48          285\nOther income (expense), net    $             846    $           -43    $     889\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in\ninterest income was due to higher yields on higher cash balances.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\nOther, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the\nimpact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by\nchanges in value from our non-affiliated investments. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our\ninvestments in non-affiliated entities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 and income tax benefit of $187 million for\nfiscal year 2023. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year\n2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax\nreturns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related\nto this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in\nunrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit,\npartially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based\ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The\nincrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax\ncredit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules\nfor a new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including\nEuropean Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two legislation that will start to become\neffective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and\nlegislation on Pillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global\nimplementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective\ntax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $         7,280    $         3,389\nMarketable securities                              18,704              9,907\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        25,984    $        13,296\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $        28,090    $         5,641\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $       -10,566    $         7,375\nactivities\nNet cash used in financing activities       $       -13,633    $       -11,617\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of\ninvestment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in\nrevenue. Accounts receivable balance in fiscal year 2024 reflected $557 million from customer payments received\nahead of the invoice due date.\nCash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily driven\nby lower marketable securities maturities and higher purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to a debt\nrepayment and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share repurchases.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated\nby our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt\nrepayment due in fiscal year 2025 and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued\nby highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nRefer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we expect to use our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the\ncash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion\nrelated to property and equipment.\nExcept for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of\nfiscal year 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends.\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of\nDirectors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in\nthe best interests of our shareholders.\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.0\nbillion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7\nbillion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional\nshares of our\n42\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased 2.8 million\nshares for $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset\ndilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and\nother investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares\nissued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022 which was not material for fiscal year 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 28, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\nJan 28, 2024\n-In millions\nDue in one year                                 $         1,250\nDue in one to five years                                  2,250\nDue in five to ten years                                  2,750\nDue in greater than ten years                             3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs                -41\nNet carrying amount                                       9,709\nLess short-term portion                                  -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                         $         8,459\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to\nour analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for\nthese investments of $93 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $9.7 billion of senior Notes net outstanding. We carry the Notes at face\nvalue less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we\nhave no\n43\nTable of Contents\nfinancial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United\nStates dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange\nrate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The\nimpact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been $116 million and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign\ncurrency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and\nJanuary 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by\ncorresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming\nthe hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.",

Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n28, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 28,\n2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system,\nwhich will update much of our\n44\nTable of Contents\nexisting core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to\nreport operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there\nare changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.",

We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the\nCompany’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was\n$16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s\napproach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii)\nthe consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were\nall 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation,\nlitigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment,\nand other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in\ntechnology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network\nequipment from threeto fouror five years, and our assembly and test equipment from fiveto seven years. The effect\nof this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $ 33million and $ 102million for cost of\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $ 135million and\nnet income of $ 114million after tax, or $ 0.05per both basic and diluted share.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations\nin the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of\nobservable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition\nof revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with\nsupport or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended\nwarranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs\nfor potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as\na single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure\nprogress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required\nto complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession\nof the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.\nRevenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue\nrelated to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a\nstandalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a\nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance\nobligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the\nprice we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from oneto three yearsfor products to repair or replace products\nfor manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product\nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an\nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification\nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical\nexperience.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including\npotential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and\nemployment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement\npayments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our\npending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated\nwith such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such\nlitigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record\nadditional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and\nliabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and\nexpenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-\nmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been\nsignificant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts\nor circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies\nbased on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that\npayment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we\nmay be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part,\nto jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax\nbenefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity\nawards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as\navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized\ngains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity,\nnet of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses\non the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the\nother income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of\navailable-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any,\nis caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely\nthan not we will be required or\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nwe intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and\nwrite-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\nequity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative\ninstruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in\nearnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to\nthe risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative\ninstruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other\ncomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is\ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of threeto seven years.\nOnce an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or\namortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to\nthirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold\nimprovements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or\nthe estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a\nquantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from\npublicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding\nindustry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer\nrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently\namortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from oneto twenty yearsusing a method that\nreflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or,\nif that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected\nto be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its\nestimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and\nliabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would\nbe reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be\ndepreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the\npurchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and\nassumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount\nrate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently\nuncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement\nperiod of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-\nmarketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have\nreadily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable\nequity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do\nnot have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in\nthe same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market\nand the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All\ngains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on\nour Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted\nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is\nidentified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n59\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide\nfor additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our\nannual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026\nretrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and changes to income tax\ndisclosures including disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments\nin the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and\nshould be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our\nannual period beginning fiscal year 2026.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended\nand restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 28,\n2024, up to 37million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007\nPlan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28,\n2024, there were 147million shares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject to continued\nservice, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25%\nvesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-\ndetermined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C)\nover a four-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-\nyearperiod, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the\nanniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on about the\nthree-yearanniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based\nPSUs that are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined\ncriteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently\namended and restated, the 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of\ncommon stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about 24months,\ndivided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be\nequal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering\nperiod or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 28,\n2024, we had 227million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs\nOutstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, Jan 29, 2023                                                           45    $                 158.45\nGranted                                                                          14    $                 374.08\nVested restricted stock                                                         -21    $                 148.56\nCanceled and forfeited                                                           -1    $                 206.35\nBalances, Jan 28, 2024                                                           37    $                 245.94\nVested and expected to vest after Jan                                            37    $                 245.49\n28, 2024\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, there were 147million and 160million shares, respectively, of common\nstock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nThe total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 28,\n2024, January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022, was $ 8.2billion, $ 4.3billion, and $ 5.6billion, respectively.\nNote 5 - Net Income Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for\nthe periods presented:\nYear Ended\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023       Jan 30, 2022\n-In millions, except per share\ndata\nNumerator:\nNet income                          $                              29,760    $         4,368    $         9,752\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares                                       2,469              2,487              2,496\nDilutive impact of outstanding\nequity                                                                 25                 20                 39\nawards\nDiluted weighted average shares                                     2,494              2,507              2,535\nNet income per share:\nBasic (1)                           $                               12.05    $          1.76    $          3.91\nDiluted (2)                         $                               11.93    $          1.74    $          3.85\nEquity awards excluded from\ndiluted net\nincome per share because their                                         15                 40                 21\neffect\nwould have been anti-dilutive\n(1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\nNote 6 - Goodwill\nAs of January 28, 2024, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.1billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nAs of January 29, 2023, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.4billion, consisting of goodwill balances\nallocated to our Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units of $ 4.0billion and $ 370million, respectively.\nGoodwill increased by $ 59million in fiscal year 2024 from an immaterial acquisition and was allocated to our\nCompute & Networking reporting unit.

These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains\nor losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to\noperating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on\nmonetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward\ncontracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these\ncontracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:\nJan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\nDesignated as cash flow hedges    $         1,168    $         1,128\nNon-designated hedges             $           597    $           366\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of\nJanuary 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023.\nAs of January 28, 2024, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18months. The expected\nrealized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency\nforward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.\nDuring fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting\ntreatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be\nhighly effective.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nThe carrying value of our outstanding notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were\nas follows:\nExpected    Effective\nRemaining Term (years)    Interest Rate       Jan 28, 2024       Jan 29, 2023\n-In millions\n0.309% Notes Due 2023 (1)                              —    0.41%            $             —    $         1,250\n0.584% Notes Due 2024                                0.4    0.66%                      1,250              1,250\n3.20% Notes Due 2026                                 2.6    3.31%                      1,000              1,000\n1.55% Notes Due 2028                                 4.4    1.64%                      1,250              1,250\n2.85% Notes Due 2030                                 6.2    2.93%                      1,500              1,500\n2.00% Notes Due 2031                                 7.4    2.09%                      1,250              1,250\n3.50% Notes Due 2040                                16.2    3.54%                      1,000              1,000\n3.50% Notes Due 2050                                26.2    3.54%                      2,000              2,000\n3.70% Notes Due 2060                                36.2    3.73%                        500                500\nUnamortized debt discount and\nissuance                                                                                 -41                -47\ncosts\nNet carrying amount                                                                    9,709             10,953\nLess short-term portion                                                               -1,250             -1,250\nTotal long-term portion                                                      $         8,459    $         9,703\n(1) In fiscal year 2024, we repaid the 0.309% Notes Due 2023.\nAll our notes are unsecured senior obligations.

The amended complaint\nasserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.\nPlaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of\nreasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without\nleave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an\nappeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August\n25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district\ncourt’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case.

This\nderivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 28, 2024, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated

We\nhave not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these\ninvestments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6billion and $ 1.5billion,\nrespectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 315million, $\n342million and $ 361million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years\n2026 and 2025, respectively.

The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income\ntaxes during a period beyond a year.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We\nrecognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our\nconsolidated statements of income of $ 42million, $ 33million, and $ 14million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we have accrued $ 140million and $ 95million,\nrespectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included\nas a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 28, 2024, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably\npossible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the\nnext twelve months.\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 28,\n2024, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal\nyears after 2020, as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal\nyears 2005 through 2023. As of January 28, 2024, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under\nexamination include Germany, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2005 through 2023.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $\n25.0billion, without expiration. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21million shares of our common stock for $\n9.7billion. As of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional\nshares of our common stock up to $ 22.5billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased\n2.8million shares for $ 1.9billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to\noffset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market\nfactors and other investment opportunities.\nDuring fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we paid $ 395million, $ 398million, and $ 399million in cash dividends to\nour shareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that\nprogram are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the\ndeclaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between\nadditional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $\n20million and retained earnings by $ 12.0billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $ 255million, $ 227million, and $ 168million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance.\nThe Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive\nartificial intelligence, or AI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle\nsolutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI\nEnterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvirtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems;\nand Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or\nGraphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-\nbased compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs,\nintellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost, and other non-recurring charges\nand benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, our CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.
