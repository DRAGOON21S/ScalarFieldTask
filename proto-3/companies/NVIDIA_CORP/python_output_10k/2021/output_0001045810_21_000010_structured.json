We purchase substrates from\nIbiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from\nMicron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and\nconfiguration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors,\nmotherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United\nStates. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test\nspecifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\nWe also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as\nWistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key\n9\nTable of Contents\nelements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are\nresponsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide\nbetter performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new\ncompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s\nrecent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on\nInfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater\nmarketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer\nor technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.\nOur current competitors include:\nsuppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions,\nincluding chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation,\nand Xilinx, Inc.;\nlarge internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated\ncomputing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc. and Amazon, Inc.;\nsuppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as\nAmbarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and\nXilinx or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\nsuppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks,\nBroadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum\nHoldings, Marvell Technology Group, and Xilinx, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet\nservices companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and\ninternationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous\npatents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending\npatent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We\nalso rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws\nof certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries\nin Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United\nStates. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We\ncontinuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based\non such factors as:\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\nthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions;\nand\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\nregions.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\nas of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon\nour capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate\nmaterial capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or\nfuture governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business\nacquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on\nour business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our\nstakeholders. As of January 31, 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and\ndevelopment and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented\nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development\npersonnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below, in addition to an overview of\nemployee programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecruitment\nThe demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new\ncollege graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education\ninstitutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our\nemployees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our\ncommunity resource groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We\nhave a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based\nforums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common\ndevelopment needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to\nlearner feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics.

We\nencourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide\ntrained coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource\ngroups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a\nsuggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the company’s\nfuture. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) that is tied to the value of\nour stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of\nour stockholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs\nin the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours\nand time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our\nbenefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including\nassistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those\nwho wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n11\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports\nall employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those\nhistorically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In fiscal\nyear 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity\nrecruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents\nthe global population.\nEfforts we are undertaking include:\nShepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from\nunderrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in minority-\nserving institutions and professional organizations.\nDeveloping an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent\nreview sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career\nacceleration programs.\nIncreasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment.\nAs of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in the United\nStates was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nSafety and COVID-19\nWe support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to\nslow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020\nfor all except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources\nto work remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain\nopen, we instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided\nresources for employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work\nfrom home expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of\nFebruary 19, 2021:\nName                Age    Position\nJen-Hsun Huang       58    President and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

          "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other\ninformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such\nan investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following\nrisks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our\nstock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Markets\nIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our\nrevenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nOur GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success\ndepends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products,\nservices and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable\ntechnical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the\ndevelopment of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as\nthe automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we must\ncontinue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and\ndeliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be\nnegatively impacted. We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by\nleveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also\ncontinue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and\nsupport, e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our\nbusiness, including by developing\n13\nTable of Contents\nmarket specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies,\nexpanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our\nbusiness in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety\nand compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and\nsystems. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not\nproduce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to\ndevelop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted,\nour business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure\nyou that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our\ncustomers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target\nmarkets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions\nevolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.\nFor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor,\nincluding for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a\ncustomer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and\nconsumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in\nsubsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in\nfuture competitive bid selection processes.\nUnanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major\nhardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing\nindustry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design\nstrategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as\nmuch revenue as anticipated, if any.\nCompetition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\nOur target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors\nexpand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new\ncompetitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may\noffer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than\nexpected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own\nfabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios\nand patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user\ncustomer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line\nwidth geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In\nour networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have\nin-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting\nsuch customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their\nown products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may\nbecome competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable\nto successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings\nto meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China,\ndemand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and\ncause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed\nand may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or\nsuppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing\nWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which\nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product\ndelivery schedule and could harm our business.\nWe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication\nfacility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nCompany Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication\nequipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on\nindependent subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment\ncontracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and\ncapacity commitments\n14\nTable of Contents\nas our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain. As\nour business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet\ncustomer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue\nand/or financial results, including:\na lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which\ncould be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient\nquantities and/or in a timely manner;\na failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or\ntest capacity for our products;\na failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process\ntechnologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node\ntechnologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;\na limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or\nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change\na supplier;\na lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our\nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.\nIn addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase\nmanufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations,\ngross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product\ndesign, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry.\nLow yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield\nproblem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be\nidentified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the\nproblem.\nWe also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of\nnew products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner.\nIn the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the\ninability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities\nof our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater\nfunctionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss\ndesign cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose\nmarket share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will\nbe harmed.\nIf our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our\nreputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.\nOur products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security\nvulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design,\nfabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are\nintroduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as\nnew versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or\nservice has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our\nproducts or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who\ndevelop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services.\nFailure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to\nthe products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs,\nAIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur\nsignificant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us\nto lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to\nfind and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers\nafter commencement of commercial shipments could result in\n15\nTable of Contents\nfailure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and\nharm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\nconsumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive\nrecalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive,\ndamage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our\ncompetitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is\nbrought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our\ntechnical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be\ninadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial\nresults.\nRisks Related to Our Operating Business\nIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.\nOur products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or\nexcess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel\nmodel, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions\nmade by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the\nchanging demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times\nand quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do\nnot occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what\nwe believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain,\nwe may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or\nprovide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial\nresults. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions,\ncompetitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue.\nFor example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency\nhas fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market,\nincluding changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for\nour new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our\nGaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop\nworkstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more\npronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple\nassumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our\nproducts, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or\nobsolete inventory include:\nchanges in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;\nchanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;\na sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;\na higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\nour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;\nless demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or\nincreased competition, including competitive pricing actions.\nThe cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could\nadversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the\nlast month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in\nresponse to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of\ncost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if\nwe incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.\n16\nTable of Contents\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate\nlead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill\ncustomers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other\nevents. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be\nable to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis,\nor at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation\ncould be damaged.\nSystem security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our\nexpected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in\nrecent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend\nagainst them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past\nand are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our\nsecurity controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third\nparties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy\nviruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in\nour products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve\nfunctionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication\nsoftware products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience\nbreaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of\nour third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of\nthis breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data\nsecurity breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our\nsystems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must\ncontinuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in\nincreased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have\nappropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or\nour business could be negatively impacted.\nActual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved\ndissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or\nthird parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting\nin litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and\nreputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our\nexpenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of\nexisting or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and\ninterrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions\ncould adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,\noutages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions,\ncyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and\nother natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these\ndisruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our\ncosts and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in\norder to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in\nCalifornia, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located\nin Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data\ncenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business\ndisruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our\nproducts and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China,\nHong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs\nthrough Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the\nUnited States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic\ndisruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and\nprofitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement\n17\nTable of Contents\ncould result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and\ncontrols on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of\n2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party\nvendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel.\nIn addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political\nor social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase\nlevels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.\nPolitical instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major\ncountries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are\ndisrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts\nfrom climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,\nenvironmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries\nand other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or\ncatastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result\nof declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.\nAll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain\nthe disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These\nmeasures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and\nour partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party\ncontract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods\ninventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers\nand suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions\nand closures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both\npositive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to\nwork, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home\ntrends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID\nlevels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in\nsales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand\nglobally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which\ncould cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain\nsupply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from\ncustomers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net\nnegative impact on our business and financial results.\nThe manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are\nconcentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant\nportion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our\nheadquarters is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and\nhas taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on\nour support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable\nuncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as\nrestrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport,\nport closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-\nfrom-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take\nfurther actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best\ninterests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely.\nThere is no\n18\nTable of Contents\ncertainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to\nperform critical functions could be harmed.\nWhile the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to\nassess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global\nfinancial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or\nfuture purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting\nfrom the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting\ndemand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to\nchange. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including\nour ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future\ndevelopments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the\nactions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related\nrestrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any\nrecession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of\nglobal supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative\nimpact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the\nfull extent and duration is uncertain.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or\ninvestments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to\nsuccessfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products\nor sell our products.\nWe have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that\noffer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products,\nstrategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April\n2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a\ntransaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or\ninvestments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop\nnew products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial\nresults. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs;\naccordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other\ntransactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete\nacquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce\nthe anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may\nin the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments.\nAdditional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or\nstrategic investments include, but are not limited to:\ndifficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;\ndifficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of\nacquired assets;\nintegrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\ncoordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;\nacquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating\ninternational operations and joint ventures;\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;\ndifficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other\napprovals or financing;\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an\nacquisition;\nthe potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for\nan acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\nfailure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;\nlegal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\nuncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target\noperate;\nthe need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or\ncompany; and\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of\nour acquisition or investment.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and\nour revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and\npartner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms\nthrough their channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our\npartner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the\nfuture, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:\nmost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay\nproduct purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;\nour partners may develop their own solutions;\nour customers may purchase products from our competitors; or\nour partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\nWe could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade\nrestrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our\ninability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our\ncustomers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these\ncustomers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain\nsales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit\ninsurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic\nconditions, which may harm our business.\nWe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our\nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the\nUnited States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We\nallocate revenue\n20\nTable of Contents\nto individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’\nrevenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of\nthe United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for\nfiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021.\nAdditionally, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States.\nThe global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\ninternational economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do\nbusiness;\nunexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws\nand employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;\ndiffering legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business\npractices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption\nlaws and regulations;\nexporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions,\ntariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;\nincreased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and\npollution limits; and\nnatural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor\n“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.\nIf our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue\nmay be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas\nincluding, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption;\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising;\nemployment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with\nsuch requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively.\nExpanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely\naffect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for\nthose workloads.\nAlthough we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there\ncan be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our\npolicies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our\nofficers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The\ntechnology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our\nexposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nAdverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or\nuncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital\nexpenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence\nand spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand\nuncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible\nthat it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the\npandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating\nresults and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown\nin economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a\ndecrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our\ncustomers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability\nto supply our products to our customers and/or the\n21\nTable of Contents\ninability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers,\ncustomers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by\ncounterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining\ncapital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge\nwith other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result\nin lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect\nsuppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations\nand deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other\nequipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or\nincreased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced\navailability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties\nincluding financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial\ninstruments.\nAdditionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing\nlocated in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may\ndirectly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the\npast been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may\ncontinue in the future, to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations.\nFurther, we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may\nhave an impact on our results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute\nour business strategy effectively.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our\nexecutives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and\ndevelopment personnel is critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally,\nchanges in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or\nregulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in\nour recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful\nproducts and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs\nin the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to\nour workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce\nneeds. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the\nanticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also\nimportant to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions\ninvolving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We continue to evolve our business\npractices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are\nworking remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices\nthat remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees\nsufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous\nfactors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of our future performance.\nAdditional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect\nour results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;\nour inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of\nour products and services;\nfluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the\nrisk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;”\n22\nTable of Contents\nchanges in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;\nour ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;\nour ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;\nproduct rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;\nour ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;\nsupply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;\ninventory write-downs;\nour ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our\npartner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner\nnetwork’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;\nour dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;\nthe inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit\ninsurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;\ncustomer bad debt write-offs;\nany unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;\nunexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;\nour ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls;\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and\ngeneral macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial\nresults. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could\ncause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete\ncould be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nWe have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings\nalleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that\nwe have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual\nproperty related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents,\nindemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that\nour products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur\nsignificant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and\nattention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such\nproceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we\ncould be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made\nagainst us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our\nindemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However,\nwe may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we\nor one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is\nused in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the\nmanufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross\nlicense our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business\ncould be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our\noperating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a\ncombination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing\narrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United\nStates and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our\nintellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our\nproducts or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the\npossibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or\npublication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position\nand reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development,\nproduct development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our\nemployees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection\nfor existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such\nprotections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential\nusers from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information\nthat is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of\nour products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal\ninformation or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used,\nstored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased\nsecurity costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or\nincreased costs related to defending legal claims.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data\nprotection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General\nData Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018\nregarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is\nstored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in\npenalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of\n2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access,\ndelete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how\nit is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right\nof action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy\nlaws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California\nPrivacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use\nof certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising\ntechniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches\nsubject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and\nenforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the\nstates in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting\na trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere\nare often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data\npractices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing\nlaws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on\nour business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in\nsignificant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher\nthan expected tax rates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll,\nsales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various\nforeign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and\nexpenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for\nincome taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.\nFor example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019\nand under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are\nreasonable, tax authorities may\n24\nTable of Contents\ndisagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our\nworldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or\ninternational tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially\nimpact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or\nstatutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in\navailable tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally\naccepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses\nnot deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in\ndeferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of\naccounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the\nincome tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts\nin the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of\nincome before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as\nthe expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may\nreduce our net income.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or\ninvestigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a\nglobal basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and\ncertain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our\nbehalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of\ndirectors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or\nsettlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and\noverall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to\nour operations.\nIn addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be\nrequired to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and\nregulations.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft\nCorporation could delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our\noutstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;\nthe prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder\napproval;\na super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nthe inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOn March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips\nand to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an\nindividual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares\nof our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft\nprovision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These\nprovisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of\ntheir choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or\nfulfilling our contractual obligations.\nIn March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040,\n$2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March\n2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20%\nNotes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments\nrelated to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return\nprogram and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments\nand other general corporate purposes.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common\nstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 19,\n2021, we had approximately 303 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a\ntotal cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed\ninto treasury stock.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share\nrepurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nfactors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may\nbe suspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized,\nsubject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December\n2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.\nRestricted Stock Unit Share Withholding\nWe also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations\nupon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year\n2021, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements.\nRefer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.\n27\nTable of Contents\nStock Performance Graphs\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and\nthe Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\npurchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a\nfocus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the\nsustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU\narchitecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.\nThrough fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable segments\nto \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics;\nvGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\nOur Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;\nMellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements,\nand autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\nAll prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming,\nProfessional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nPending Acquisition of Arm Limited\nOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank,\nall allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash\nat signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and\nissue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction\nincludes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by\nArm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can\nelect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our\ncommon stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2\nbillion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the\nprepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a\n20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of\nspecified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting\nperiod, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain\nother assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European\nUnion, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will\nbe refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair\nvalue basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We\nbelieve the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.\nDemand\nOur products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are\nvery long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or\nexcess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel\nmodel, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions\nmade\n29\nTable of Contents\nby our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing\ndemand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and\nquicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not\noccur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we\nbelieve is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we\nmay place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or\nprovide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial\nresults. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions,\ncompetitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue.\nFor example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency\nhas fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market,\nincluding changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\npending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for\nour new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our\nGaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop\nworkstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more\npronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating\ntrends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\nCOVID-19\nThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including\nrestrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly\nimpacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March\n2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.\nOur Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn,\nand play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home\ntrends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In\nAutomotive, COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand\nglobally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply\nchain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and\nfinancial results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the\nheading “Risk Factors”.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper\nand other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset\npurchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.\nFiscal Year 2021 Summary\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,          January 26,\n2021                 2020       Change\n-$ in millions, except per\nshare data\nRevenue                         $                           16,675       $       10,918               Up 53%\nGross margin                                                  62.3  %              62.0  %            Up 30 bps\nOperating expenses              $                            5,864       $        3,922               Up 50%\nIncome from operations          $                            4,532       $        2,846               Up 59%\nNet income                      $                            4,332       $        2,796               Up 55%\nNet income per diluted share    $                             6.90       $         4.52               Up 53%\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $16.68 billion, up 53% from a year earlier.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFrom a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across\ndesktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce\nRTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations\nas enterprise demand was impacted by COVID.\nData Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp\nof the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company\nrevenue.\nAutomotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy\ninfotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and\nautonomous vehicle solutions.\nOEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with\nhigher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by\nthe inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee\ncompensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily\ninclude $190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring\namortization of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm.\nIncome from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net\nincome per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a\nyear earlier.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90\nbillion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March\n2020 and cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions.\nWe paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in our Gaming platform, we announced the launch of new laptop models powered by NVIDIA\nGeForce GPUs; unveiled GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs including our second generation NVIDIA RTX; expanded NVIDIA\nGeForce NOW; announced that a range of games now support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS AI super resolution;\nunveiled NVIDIA Reflex and NVIDIA Broadcast; expanded the RTX Studio lineup powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs;\nand released DLSS 2.0.\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we launched mobile workstations with Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and\nMicrosoft based on NVIDIA Quadro graphics for professional creators; released NVIDIA Quadro View; collaborated with\nAdobe to bring GPU-accelerated neural filters to Adobe Photoshop AI-powered tools; powered Autodesk’s latest 3D\nvisualization software with NVIDIA Quadro RTX; and collaborated with many other independent software vendors to\nhelp incorporate NVIDIA RTX and AI technology in their applications.\nIn our Data Center platform, we announced the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and DGX A100, the first products based on\nthe NVIDIA Ampere architecture; announced more than 50 NVIDIA A100-powered systems with OEM partners and released\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems with NVIDIA A100 GPUs to OEMs; shared news that major cloud providers, including Google\nCloud Platform, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, reached general availability of cloud\ncomputing instances based on the NVIDIA A100 GPU; announced the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD Solution for Enterprise;\nintroduced the new family of NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs; introduced new products for the EGX Edge AI platform;\nannounced a broad partnership with VMware to create an end-to-end enterprise platform for AI and a new architecture\nfor data center, cloud and edge; powered eight of the top 10, and two-thirds of the total systems, on the latest\nTOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers; announced that five supercomputers backed by EuroHPC will use\nNVIDIA’s data center accelerators or networking; and set 16 AI performance records on the latest MLPerf benchmarks.\nIn our Automotive platform, we announced with Mercedes-Benz that the automaker will launch software-defined,\nintelligent vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology starting in 2024; announced that NVIDIA DRIVE autonomous\n31\nTable of Contents\ndriving technology is powering a range of electric vehicles from carmakers SAIC, Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng, robotaxi-\nmaker Zoox, and cabless truck-maker Einride; announced that NVIDIA is powering the new Mercedes-Benz AI cockpit in\nthe first half of 2021; announced that Hyundai Motor Group’s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will\ncome standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems starting in 2022; and expanded the NVIDIA DRIVE\nsensor ecosystem with new solutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses\nand related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related\nto business combinations, inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of\nthese critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit\nCommittee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price\nexceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly\nintangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In\ncertain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions\nand subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly,\nthe measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and\ncircumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period\nadjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been\nrecorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business\ncombination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible\narises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and\nsold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract,\nasset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and\ntrade name acquired in a business combination and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally\nassess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate\nfair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market\nconditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require\nsignificant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our\nassessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological\nfeasibility.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost\nor net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments\ncompared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or\n32\nTable of Contents\nunexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer\npurchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was\ninsignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to\npurchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party\nmanufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and\npricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact\ndemand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for\nfurther discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and\nsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the\ncontract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of\nthe transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n(where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs\nto determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or\nas, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold\nalong with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the\nservice period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer\nprograms and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our\nintellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the\ndevelopment services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are\nperformed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated\ntotal cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we\nrecord a provision for such loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change\n33\nTable of Contents\nbased, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax\nlaws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.\nIn addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these\namounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if\nindicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment\nreview process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.\nWe changed our reportable segments to \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\" starting with the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2021. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new\nreporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately\nprior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and\nthe amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and\n$3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and\ninvolves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating\nassets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe\nto be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal\nyear 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\nyear 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 26, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\nRevenue                                    100.0  %          100.0  %\nCost of revenue                             37.7              38.0\nGross profit                                62.3              62.0\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development                    23.5              25.9\nSales, general and administrative           11.6              10.0\nTotal operating expenses                    35.1              35.9\nIncome from operations                      27.2              26.1\nInterest income                              0.3               1.6\nInterest expense                            -1.1              -0.5\nOther, net                                   0.1                 —\nOther income (expense), net                 -0.7               1.1\nIncome before income tax expense            26.5              27.2\nIncome tax expense                           0.5               1.6\nNet income                                  26.0  %           25.6  %\nRevenue\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,            $         %\n2021              2020       Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nGraphics                $           9,834    $        7,639    $   2,195        29  %\nCompute & Networking                6,841             3,279        3,562       109  %\nTotal                   $          16,675    $       10,918    $   5,757        53  %\nGraphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting\ngrowth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations.\nCompute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to\nfiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA\nAmpere GPU architecture systems and new products.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal\nyears 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the\nlocation to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a\ndifferent location.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of\nour total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily\nof the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and\npackaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such\npurchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of\n35\nTable of Contents\nrevenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related\ncosts, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\nOur overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal\nyear 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by\nMellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and\nongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million.\nInventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of\ninventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nAs a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nA discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:\nGraphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year\n2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix\nwithin Quadro/Nvidia RTX.\nCompute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when\ncompared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center\ncompute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,          January 26,               $         %\n2021                 2020          Change    Change\n-$ in millions\nResearch and development expenses    $           3,924       $        2,829       $   1,095        39  %\n% of net revenue                                  23.5  %              25.9  %\nSales, general and administrative                1,940                1,093             847        77  %\nexpenses\n% of net revenue                                  11.6  %              10.0  %\nTotal operating expenses             $           5,864       $        3,922       $   1,942        50  %\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven\nprimarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related\ncosts, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020,\ndriven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related\ncosts, including stock-based compensation.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income\nwas $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was\nprimarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September\n2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our\nannual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a\ndecrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from\nstock-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\nprimarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the\ntax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nCash and cash equivalents                 $           847    $       10,896\nMarketable securities                              10,714                 1\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable    $        11,561    $       10,897\nsecurities\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nNet cash provided by operating              $         5,822    $        4,761\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing    $       -19,675    $        6,145\nactivities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing    $         3,804    $         -792\nactivities\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of\n$664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed\nincome securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our\nportfolio.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was\nallocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual\nproperty licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment\nresulted in $1.36 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion\nfor the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets\nand $0.47 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net\nincome, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital\ninclude increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021\nrevenue, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm.\nCash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020,\nwhich primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed\nacquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and\nintangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020,\nwhich primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to\ntax on restricted stock units.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash\ngenerated by our operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next\ntwelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our\ncapital requirements beyond twelve months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These\nmarketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and\nthe cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion\nrelated to property and equipment, including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.\nWe have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for\nwhich we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than\nthat, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of\nJanuary 31, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to\nNote 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nIn fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of\nfuture cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of\nour common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year\n2021.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities\nWe have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due\n2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.\nWe have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the\nSeptember 2016 Notes.\nWe have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can\nobtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under\nthis agreement.\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $395 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current\nincome tax payable as of January 31, 2021. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax\nliability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax\npositions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by\nthe Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

          "content": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The\ninvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital\nneeds and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis,\nparallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would\nresult in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these\ninvestments of $8 million, respectively.\nIn September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March\n2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050,\nand $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with\nchanges in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item\n15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign\ncurrency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of\nforeign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years\n2021 and 2020.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars,\nand, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar\nrelative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to\ncompete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result\nin our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have\ninternational operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses\nbenefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our\noperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge\nrelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are\nrecognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary\nassets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in\nother income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would\nhave been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset\na corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31,\n2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense),\nnet by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,\nassuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of January 31, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set\nforth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\n31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is\nincluded herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the\nfact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually\nmonitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating\neffectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe\nthat we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial\nreporting during this integration.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n40\nTable of Contents",

Exhibits\nThe exhibits listed in the accompanying index to exhibits are filed or incorporated by          79\nreference as a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n43\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January\n31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item\n15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it\naccounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of\n44\nTable of Contents\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.- Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and\nDevelopment Intangible Assets Acquired\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the\nacquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for consideration of approximately $7.13 billion, of which $1,640 million\nof developed technology and $630 million of in-process research and development intangible assets were recorded.\nThe fair values of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets were determined\nusing the multi-period excess earnings method. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment\nin estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of certain estimates and\nassumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, the technology migration curve, and\nrisk-adjusted discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the\ndeveloped technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of\nMellanox Technologies Ltd. is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity\nin applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and in-process research and\ndevelopment intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate,\n(ii) significant audit effort in evaluating management’s assumptions relating to the estimate, such as revenue\ngrowth and the technology migration curve, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible\nassets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration\ncurve. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s\nprocess for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and in-process research and development\nintangible assets acquired. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation\nmethod and the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology\nmigration curve for the intangible assets acquired, and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to\nassist with the evaluation. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past\nperformance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts. The technology migration curve was\nevaluated by considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and in-process research and\ndevelopment based on the assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and\nnew generation products and the technology carryover rate.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory\nprovisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess\ninventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and\nmarket conditions. As\n45\nTable of Contents\ndisclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of\ninventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including\ndeveloping assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over\nmanagement’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating\nthe appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data\nused in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved\nevaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results,\nincluding historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes\nin technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\nDelaware in April 1998.\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year.\nFiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement\ncosts, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates\nconsider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and\nsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the\ncontract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of\nthe transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n(where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs\nto determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or\nas, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold\nalong with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the\nservice period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer\nprograms and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products\nin various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners\nthat are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential\nrebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our\nintellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the\ndevelopment services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are\nperformed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated\ntotal cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we\nrecord a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the\ncustomer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the\nduration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-\ncontract customer support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made\navailable to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from oneto three yearsfor products in order to\nrepair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes\nthe estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for\nknown warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the\nfair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our\ncorporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate\nthe fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The\ncompensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated\namortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or\nESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.\nStock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we\nestimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent\nperiods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many\nuncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other\nthird-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If\ninformation becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we\nwill record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or\ninvestigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary\nassets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary\nassets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those\nexpenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nGains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\n53\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax\nbenefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in\naccounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income\ntax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we\ndetermine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial\nstatements accordingly.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728million related to state and certain foreign deferred\ntax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future\ntaxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of\ntax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during\nthe period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially\ndilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method,\nthe effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for\nperiods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid\ndebt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments\nas current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of\nacquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the\nrelated unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of\nshareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.\nRealized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification\nmethod and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair\nvalue of an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the\ndifference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities\nif it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net\nsection of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\ntheir fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable\nsecurities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related\nunrealized gains or losses\n54\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair\nvalue of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are\nrecognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative\ninstruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of\nchange together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For\nderivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the\nderivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently\nrecognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not\ndesignated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-\nrated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain\nlimits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and\nmaintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific\ncustomers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our\ncustomers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer\nissues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of\ngross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit\ninsurance or letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and\noverhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of\npurchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down\nour inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our\ninventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been\nwritten-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally threeto five years. Once an asset is\nidentified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and\nassets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than\n12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the\nlease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred\nand prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the\nlease\n55\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nwhen it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if\nindicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a\nqualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant\nevents and factors affecting the reporting units.\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting\nunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are\nnot limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable\nmultiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates\nregarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process\nresearch and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology\nlicenses, patents, and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite\nlives over periods ranging from twoto twenty yearsusing a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic\nbenefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an\nintangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an\namortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nexceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated\ndiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be\ndisposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the\nfair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,\nbut our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions\nused in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are\ninherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the\nmeasurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nonly if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded\nthrough net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.\nThe estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities\nby the investee.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing\nincurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires\nconsideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for\naccounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the\nstandard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nPending Acquisition of Arm Limited\nOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank\nall allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40billion. We paid $ 2billion in\nSigning Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10billion in cash and issue to SoftBank\n44.3million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $ 21.5billion. The transaction includes a\npotential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during\nthe fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either\nup to an additional $ 5billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3million shares of our common stock. We will issue\nup to $ 1.5billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2billion paid upon signing was\nallocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36billion and the prepayment of intellectual\nproperty licenses from Arm of $ 0.17billion and royalties of $ 0.47billion, both with a 20-yearterm. The closing of\nthe acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and\nregulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation\nof the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are\nengaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other\njurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $\n1.25billion of the Signing Consideration. The $ 2billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis\nand any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the\nclosing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.\nAcquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\nOn April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase\nconsideration of $ 7.13billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing,\nstorage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the\nentire computing, networking, and storage stack.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\nPurchase Price\nCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares    $  7,033\n(1)\nCash for Mellanox equity awards (2)                         16\nTotal cash consideration                                 7,049\nFair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by             85\nNVIDIA (3)\nTotal purchase consideration                          $  7,134\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents                             $    115\nMarketable securities                                      699\nAccounts receivable, net                                   216\nInventories                                                320\nPrepaid expenses and other assets                          179\nProperty and equipment, net                                144\nGoodwill                                                 3,431\nIntangible assets                                        2,970\nAccounts payable                                          -136\nAccrued and other current liabilities                     -236\nIncome tax liability                                      -191\nDeferred income tax liability                             -258\nOther long-term liabilities                               -119\n$  7,134\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately\n56million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249thousand Mellanox stock options held\nby employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination\nservices.\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non the estimated fair values.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.\nGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim\nindicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax\npurposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment.\nRefer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021\nsince the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal\nyear 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration.\nAcquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28million were included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:\nFair Value\n(In millions)    Useful Lives\nDeveloped technology (1)                    $          1,640    5 years\nCustomer relationships (2)                               440    3 years\nOrder backlog (3)                                        190    Based on actual shipments\nTrade names (4)                                           70    5 years\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible               2,340\nassets\nIPR&D (5)                                                630    N/A\nTotal identified intangible assets          $          2,970\n(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without\nMethod.\n(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-\nPeriod Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-\nRoyalty Method under the income approach.\n(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the\npattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset\nof $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project\nwill be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project\nmay be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest\nrates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP\nis estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU,\nPSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values\nof RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the\nestimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are\nestimated based on historical experience.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the\nfollowing equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have\nassumed the stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and substituted them with our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and\nrestated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other\nstock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options.\nAs of January 31, 2021, up to 244million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards\ngranted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options.\nAll options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs,\nPSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37million shares\navailable for future issuance.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-yearperiod, subject\nto continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of\ngrant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-yearperiod, subject to continued service, with\n40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting\nquarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-yearanniversary of the date of grant.\nHowever, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\nAmended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated,\nthe 2012 Plan.\nEmployees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock.\nStarting in March 2021, employees who participate may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares\nof common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately\n24months, which is generally divided into fourpurchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased\nunder our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the\ncommencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. As\nof January 31, 2021, we had 60million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\nNumber of Shares            Weighted Average\n(In millions, except years and per share data)       Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalances, January 26, 2020                                                       14    $                 176.72\nGranted                                                                           9    $                 307.25\nVested restricted stock                                                          -7    $                 159.35\nCanceled and forfeited                                                           -1    $                 193.83\nBalances, January 31, 2021                                                       15    $                 264.69\nVested and expected to vest after                                                14    $                 264.13\nJanuary 31, 2021\nAs of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, there were 37million and 29million shares, respectively, of common\nstock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $\n1.20billion, with an average exercise price of $ 14.40per share and an average remaining term of 1.7years.

As a result, our\nreporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their\nrelative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was nogoodwill\nimpairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill\nwas $ 4.19billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was\n$ 347million and $ 3.85billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $\n618million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $\n347million and $ 271million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $ 3.57billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill\nof $ 3.43billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $ 143million from other acquisition\nactivities, all of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit.

Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of\nintangible assets as of January 31, 2021 is estimated to be $ 548million in fiscal year 2022, $ 545million in\nfiscal year 2023, $ 423million in fiscal year 2024, $ 367million in fiscal year 2025, $ 97million in fiscal year\n2026, and $ 757million in fiscal year 2027 and thereafter.\nNote 8 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale”\ndebt securities.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26,\n2020:\nJanuary 31,\n2021\nAmortized       Unrealized       Unrealized          Estimated         Reported\nCost             Gain       Loss               Fair Value               as\nCash               Marketable\nEquivalents        Securities\n-In\nmillions\nCorporate\ndebt          $        4,442    $           2    $  —              $        4,444    $         234    $   4,210\nsecurities\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by\nUnited                 2,975                1       —                       2,976               28        2,948\nStates\ngovernment\nagencies\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by              2,846                —       —                       2,846               25        2,821\nthe United\nStates\nTreasury\nCertifica…               705                —       —                         705               37          668\nof deposit\nMoney\nmarket                   313                —       —                         313              313            —\nfunds\nForeign\ngovernment                67                —       —                          67                            67\nbonds\nTotal         $       11,348    $           3    $  —              $       11,351    $         637    $  10,714\nJanuary 26,\n2020\nAmortized       Unrealized       Unrealized            Estimated       Reported as\nCost       Gain             Loss                 Fair Value\nCash                 Marketable\nEquivalents          Securities\n-In millions\nMoney\nmarket         $         7,507    $  —             $  —               $         7,507    $        7,507    $  —\nfunds\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by                1,358       —                —                         1,358             1,358       —\nthe United\nStates\nTreasury\nDebt\nsecurities\nissued by\nUnited                   1,096       —                —                         1,096             1,096       —\nStates\ngovernment\nagencies\nCorporate\ndebt                       592       —                —                           592               592       —\nsecurities\nForeign\ngovernment                 200       —                —                           200               200       —\nbonds\nCertificat…                 27       —                —                            27                27       —\nof deposit\nAsset-back…                  1       —                —                             1                 —       1\nsecurities\nTotal          $        10,781    $  —             $  —               $        10,781    $       10,780    $  1\nNet realized gains and unrealized gains and losses were not significant for all periods presented.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2021\nand January 26, 2020 are shown below by contractual maturity.\nJanuary 31, 2021                        January 26, 2020\nAmortized        Estimated              Amortized        Estimated\nCost       Fair Value                   Cost       Fair Value\n-In millions\nLess than one year    $            10,782    $      10,783    $            10,781    $      10,781\nDue in 1 - 5 years                    566              568                      —                —\nTotal                 $            11,348    $      11,351    $            10,781    $      10,781\n65\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 9 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical\nassets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.

Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.\nNote 12 - Debt\nLong-Term Debt\nIn March 2020, we issued $ 1.50billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $ 1.00billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $\n2.00billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $ 500million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March\n2020 Notes.

The Credit Agreement expires October 2021.\nWe have a $ 575million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we\nhad not issued any commercial paper.\nNote 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $ 2.54billion, which are\nexpected to occur over the next 12 months, and other purchase obligations totaling $ 317million, which are\nprimarily expected to occur over the next 18 months.\nAccrual for Product Warranty Liabilities\nThe estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 22million and $ 15million as of January 31, 2021 and\nJanuary 26, 2020, respectively.\nIn connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the\nindemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual\nproperty indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential\nfuture payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.

The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and\ncertain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the\nExchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory\nand the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nallege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.\nPlaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and\nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On\nJune 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any\nclaims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the\nmotion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint\nin the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary\nduty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the\nExchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory\nand the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other\nrelief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.\n(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the\nIn Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty,\nunjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading\nstatements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and\nunspecified corporate governance measures.\nIt is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to\nthese same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal\nproceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except\nas specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated\nat this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,\nwhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal                         $           197    $           65    $            1\nState                                         1                 4                 —\nForeign                                     161                87                69\nTotal current                               359               156                70\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal                                    -246                 2              -315\nForeign                                     -36                16                 —\nTotal deferred                             -282                18              -315\nIncome tax expense (benefit)    $            77    $          174    $         -245\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nDomestic                    $         1,437    $          620    $        1,843\nForeign                               2,972             2,350             2,053\nIncome before income tax    $         4,409    $        2,970    $        3,896\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of\n21% to income before income taxes as follows:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nTax expense computed at federal           $           926    $          624    $          818\nstatutory rate\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal tax                 10                12                23\neffect\nForeign tax rate differential                        -561              -301              -412\nU.S. federal R&D tax credit                          -173              -110              -141\nStock-based compensation                             -136               -60              -191\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017                           —                 —              -368\nOther                                                  11                 9                26\nIncome tax expense (benefit)              $            77    $          174    $         -245\n72\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are presented below:\nJanuary 31,       January 26,\n2021              2020\n-In millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nGILTI deferred tax assets               $           709    $          428\nResearch and other tax credit                       650               605\ncarryforwards\nOperating lease liabilities                         120               114\nNet operating loss carryforwards                    100                62\nAccruals and reserves, not currently                 59                39\ndeductible for tax purposes\nStock-based compensation                             36                28\nProperty, equipment and intangible                   32                12\nassets\nGross deferred tax assets                         1,706             1,288\nLess valuation allowance                           -728              -621\nTotal deferred tax assets                           978               667\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquired intangibles                               -191                -1\nUnremitted earnings of foreign                     -111               -40\nsubsidiaries\nOperating lease assets                             -111              -107\nGross deferred tax liabilities                     -413              -148\nNet deferred tax asset (1)              $           565    $          519\n(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 806million and $ 548million and long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities of $ 241million and $ 29million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term\ndeferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognized an income tax expense of $ 77million and $ 174million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nand income tax benefit of $ 245million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7%, 5.9%, and (\n6.3)% for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year\n2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject\nto United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective\ntax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence\nof tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%\ndue primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where\nthe tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits,\nexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax\neffects of the TCJA in 2019.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the\nacquisition, we recorded $ 256million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over\nthe tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also\nrecorded $ 153million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred\ntax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price\nallocation. As a result of the acquisition, as of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest\napproximately $ 1.16billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have\nnot provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments\nin Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\nAs of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728million and $ 621million,\nrespectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be\nrealized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax\n73\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nassets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the\nperiod.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 333million, $\n308million and $ 344million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 344million may be carried forward\nindefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 238million that will\nbegin to expire in fiscal year 2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 987million, of which $\n944million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 43million is\nattributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or\nmodification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances.\nUtilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to\nlimitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state\nand foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and\ntax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had $ 776million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 606million would affect\nour effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 132million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state\nincome tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that\nwould likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 606million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31,\n2021 consisted of $ 352million recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $ 5million recorded in current income\ntaxes payable, and $ 249million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nBalance at beginning of period            $           583    $          477    $          447\nIncreases in tax positions for current                158               104               129\nyear\nIncreases in tax positions for prior                   60                 7                52\nyears (1)\nDecreases in tax positions for prior                  -11                 —              -141\nyears\nSettlements                                            -5                 —                 —\nLapse in statute of limitations                        -9                -5               -10\nBalance at end of period                  $           776    $          583    $          477\n(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the\nMellanox acquisition.\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we\nanticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term\nliability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt\nof cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\nOur policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $ 44million, $ 31million,\nand $ 21million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits,\nwhich is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $ 352million and the related interest and penalties of $ 43million are included in non-current income\ntaxes payable, and unrecognized tax benefits of $ 5million and the related interest and penalties of $ 1million are\nincluded in current income taxes payable.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could\nbe greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related\nmatters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled\nor otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on\nsuch tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31,\n2021, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong,\nTaiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020. As of January 31,\n2021, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India, for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.\nNote 15 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\nThrough January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260million shares under our share repurchase program\nfor a total cost of $ 7.08billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury\nstock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our\ncommon stock up to $ 7.24billion through December 2022.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 395million in cash dividends to our shareholders.\nNote 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.\nOur contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 120million, $ 76million, and $ 70million,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial\ninformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial\nperformance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported twooperating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the\nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in\nwhich our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The twonew operating segments are\n\"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking\". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments\nare equivalent to our reportable segments.\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related\ninfrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for\ncloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute &\nNetworking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox\nnetworking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and\nautonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or\nexpenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &\nNetworking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include\nstock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal\nsettlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and\namortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each\nsegment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,\ntherefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment\nreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our\nreportable segments and the “All Other” category.\n75\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nGraphics\nYear Ended January 31, 2021:       (In millions)       Compute & Networking       All Other       Consolidated\nRevenue                         $          9,834    $                 6,841    $          —    $        16,675\nOperating income (loss)         $          4,612    $                 2,548    $     -2,628    $         4,532\nYear Ended January 26, 2020:\nRevenue                         $          7,639    $                 3,279    $          —    $        10,918\nOperating income (loss)         $          3,267    $                   751    $     -1,172    $         2,846\nYear Ended January 27, 2019:\nRevenue                         $          8,159    $                 3,557    $          —    $        11,716\nOperating income (loss)         $          3,417    $                 1,251    $       -864    $         3,804\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,       January 26,       January 27,\n2021              2020              2019\n-In millions\nReconciling items included in \"All\nOther\" category:\nStock-based compensation expense         $        -1,397    $         -844    $         -557\nAcquisition-related intangible asset                -591                -6                -6\namortization\nUnallocated cost of revenue and                     -357              -283              -261\noperating expenses\nAcquisition-related inventory step-up               -161                 —                 —\ncharge\nAcquisition-related and other costs                  -84               -25                 4\nIP-related costs                                     -38               -14               -35\nLegal settlement costs                                 —                 —                -9\nTotal                                    $        -2,628    $       -1,172    $         -864\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are\ninitially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different\nlocation.
