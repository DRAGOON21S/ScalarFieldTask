Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 22, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter
ended April 28, 2024. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein is financial information and commentary by
Colette M. Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, regarding results for the
quarter ended April 28, 2024, or the CFO Commentary. The CFO Commentary will be posted to
http://investor.nvidia.com immediately after the filing of this Current Report.

The press release and CFO Commentary are furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or subject to the liabilities of that Section or Sections 11 and
12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information in this Current Report shall not be
incorporated by reference in any filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made by the Company,
whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
                                                                                                                   
  Item 8.01. Other Events.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
On May 22, 2024, the Company announced a ten-for-one forward stock split, or the Stock Split, of the Company’s
issued common stock to be effected through the filing of an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, or the Amendment, with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. The Amendment will result in a
proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. As a result of the Stock Split, each
record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024 will receive nine additional
shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to
commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.

The Company also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150 percent from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of
common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis and will be paid
on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.
