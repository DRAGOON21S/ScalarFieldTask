Adoption of Fiscal Year 2022 Variable Compensation Plan
On March 15, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company,
adopted the Variable Compensation Plan for Fiscal Year 2022, or the 2022 Plan, which provides eligible executive
officers the opportunity to earn a variable cash payment based on the level of achievement by the Company of
certain corporate performance goals, or the Performance Goals, during fiscal year 2022. The Company operates on a
fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January and designates its fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal
year ends. Fiscal year 2022 refers to the Company’s fiscal year ending January 30, 2022.

The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2022 based upon the achievement of
specified fiscal year 2022 revenue and has established threshold, base operating plan, and stretch operating plan
levels. An eligible participant’s variable cash compensation under the 2022 Plan will be based on the achievement
by the Company of the Performance Goals in fiscal year 2022.

Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the
payment date under the 2022 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.

The following table sets forth the respective target award opportunities for base operating plan achievement for
the Company’s named executive officers under the 2022 Plan:
