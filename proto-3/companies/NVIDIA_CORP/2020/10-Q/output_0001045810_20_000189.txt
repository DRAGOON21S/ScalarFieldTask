Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and
with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X.
The January 26, 2020 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, as filed with the SEC, but
does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and
financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative
of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report include the financial results of Mellanox
Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, prospectively from April 27, 2020. For additional details, refer to Note 2 -
Business Combination.
Significant Accounting Policies

Except for the accounting policies for business combination and investment in non-affiliated entities, there have
been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.
Business Combination
We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities
assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, or IPR&D, based on their
estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net
tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject
to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the
amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash
flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the
estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we record
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the
conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an
acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our condensed consolidated
statements of income.
We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. We assess for
impairment thereafter. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased
intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities
Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis
only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded
through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive
market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.
The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities
by the investee.

Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year and
fiscal year 2020 is a 52-week year. The third quarters of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement
costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates
consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. These
estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing
incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for
accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the
standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited

On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or
Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from
SoftBank, all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40billion. We paid $
2billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10billion
in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $ 21.5billion. The
transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance
targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can
elect to receive either up to $ 5billion in cash or up to 10.3million shares of our common stock. We will issue up
to $ 1.5billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2billion paid upon signing was
allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36billion and the prepayment of intellectual
property licenses from Arm of $ 0.17billion and royalties of $ 0.47billion. The closing of the acquisition is
subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and
approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization
and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. If the Purchase Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $ 1.25billion of the Signing Consideration. The $
2billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will
use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the
first quarter of calendar year 2022.

We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on the preliminary estimates of their estimated fair values, which were determined using generally accepted
valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of the acquisition and are
subject to change during the measurement period which is not expected to exceed one year. The primary tasks that
are required to be completed include validation of business level forecasts, jurisdictional forecasts, customer
attrition rates, contingent liabilities assessments and any related tax impacts from the acquisition. Any
adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period will be
recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox.
Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim
indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax
purposes. Goodwill

arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 15 –
Segment Information for further details on segments.

The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the
third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue
attributable to Mellanox was approximately 13% and 10% of consolidated revenue for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2021, respectively. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to
Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 27million were included in
selling, general and administrative expense for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021.

(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.
(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without
Method.
(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-
Period Excess Earning Method.
(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-
Royalty Method under the income approach.
(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earning Method.
The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the
pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.

Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached
technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset
of $ 630million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project
will be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired
or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to
amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

We recognized an income tax expense of $ 12million and $ 64million for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2021, respectively, and $ 60million and $ 109million for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9% and
2.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 6.3% and 5.6% for the third
quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 as compared
to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings
subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 21% due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, and tax benefits related to stock-based
compensation.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the
acquisition, we recorded $ 256million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over
the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also
recorded $ 153million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred
tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price
allocation. Upon finalization of the purchase price allocation, additional adjustments to the amount of our net
deferred taxes and long-term tax liabilities may be required. As a result of the acquisition, we intend to
indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 675million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S.
subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences
related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.

For the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain
subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we assumed $ 59million of
unrecognized tax

benefits and $ 4million of related interest through the Mellanox acquisition. Other than these amounts, there have
been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal
year ended January 26, 2020.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we
believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax
authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and
foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying
matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 25, 2020, we do not
believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or
decrease within the next twelve months.

(1) Investment in non-affiliated entities is privately held and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis
only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded
through net income. The amount recorded as of October 25, 2020 has not been significant.

(2) These liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value, net of
unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and are not marked to fair value each period. Refer to Note 12 of
these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(1) As of October 25, 2020, acquisition-related intangible assets include the fair value of a Mellanox IPR&D
project of $ 630million, which has not been amortized. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will
begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $ 174million and $ 465million for the third quarter and

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the remaining contracted license, development
arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and
amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of October 25, 2020, the amount of our remaining performance
obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 679million, of which we expect to recognize approximately
41% as revenue over the next twelve monthsand the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining
performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements
on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains
or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to
operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 25, 2020 and January 26, 2020.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including
intercompany hedging instruments, or intercompany derivatives, with wholly-owned subsidiaries in order to hedge
certain forecasted expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in
other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 25,
2020 and January 26, 2020:

As of October 25, 2020, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The
expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign
currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.

During the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments
designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such
instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with
ineffectiveness.

whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of
the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $ 1.98billion,
after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.

Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior
obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively
subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All
existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.
The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:

As of October 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required covenants under the Notes.
Revolving Credit Facility

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $ 575million for general corporate purposes and can
obtain revolving loan commitments up to $ 425million. As of October 25, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts and
were in compliance with the required covenants under this agreement.

Commercial Paper

We have a $ 575million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 25, 2020, we
had not issued any commercial paper.

Purchase Obligations

As of October 25, 2020, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $ 2.57billion and other purchase
obligations totaling $ 398million.

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities

The estimated amount of product returns and warranty liabilities was $ 19million and $ 15million as of October 25,
2020 and January 26, 2020, respectively, and the activities related to the warranty liabilities were not
significant.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the
indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual
property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential
future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We
have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Litigation

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on
December 21, 2018, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13,
2020. The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or
misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between
May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants
violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified
compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and
further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended
complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA
or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet
issued a decision.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation
Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint
in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary
duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory
and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other
relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.
(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the
In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty,
unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections
14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading
statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and
unspecified corporate governance measures.

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to
these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of October 25, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal
proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except
as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and,
while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will
not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Capital Return Program

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Through October 25, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260million shares under our share repurchase program
for a total cost of $ 7.08billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury
stock. As of October 25, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional
shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24billion through December 2022.

During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 99million and $ 296million in cash
dividends to our shareholders, respectively.

  Note 15 - Segment Information                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial
information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial
performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported twooperating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the
first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in
which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The twonew operating segments are
"Graphics" and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments
are equivalent to our reportable segments.

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related
infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-
based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking
segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI, high performance computing,
or HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles;
and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or
expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our twosegments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &
Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include
stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal
settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and
amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each
segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and,
therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment
reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our
reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year
2021. One customer represented 10% and 11% of our total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2020, respectively, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.

One customer represented 13% and 21% of our accounts receivable balance as of October 25, 2020 and January 26,
2020, respectively.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to Graphics and Compute &
Networking, as discussed in Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our
reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their
relative fair values. We determined there was nogoodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of
October 25, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.19billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to
our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $ 347million and $ 3.85billion, respectively. In the
first nine months of fiscal year 2021, goodwill increased by $ 3.57billion. The increase in goodwill in the first
nine months of fiscal year 2021 was due to goodwill of $ 3.43billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and
goodwill of $ 133million from other acquisition activity, both of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking
reporting unit.

  Our Company and Our Businesses                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a
focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the
sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU
architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.

Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. Starting with the first quarter of
fiscal year 2021, our reportable segments have changed to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking".

Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related
infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-
based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;
Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other
embedded platforms.

All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.

  Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank,
all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in
Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3
million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential
earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either
up to $5 billion in cash or up to 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in
restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between
advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses
from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary
closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and
expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution
of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon
signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in
the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of
calendar year 2022.
                                                                                                                   
  COVID-19                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including
restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly
impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March
2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.

Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn,
and play from home. In Professional Visualization, stronger demand for mobile workstations due to work from home
trends was partially offset by lower demand for desktop workstations. In Automotive, customers' production volumes
have largely returned to pre-COVID levels. In our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the
availability of capacity and components.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply
chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and
financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information under
the heading “Risk Factors”.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with
commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its
existing operations.

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $4.73 billion, up 57% from a year earlier and up 22%
sequentially.

Graphics segment revenue was $2.79 billion, up 25% from a year earlier and up 34% sequentially.

Compute & Networking segment revenue was $1.94 billion, up 146% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially.

From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $2.27 billion, up 37% both from a year ago and sequentially.
The increases reflect higher sales across desktop and notebook gaming GPUs, and game console SOCs. Desktop gaming
sales benefited from the launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

Professional Visualization revenue was $236 million, down 27% from a year earlier and up 16% sequentially. The
year-on-year decline was influenced by COVID-19, with reduced demand for desktop workstations. The sequential
increase reflects a sharp rebound in mobile workstations due to work from home trends.

Data Center revenue was $1.90 billion, up 162% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. Our recent acquisition of
Mellanox contributed 13% of total company revenue and approximately a third of Data Center revenue. In addition to
Mellanox, the year-on-year and sequential increases were driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products.

Automotive revenue was $125 million, down 23% from a year earlier and up 13% sequentially. The year-on-year
decrease reflects a decline in revenue from legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development
agreements. The sequential increase reflects higher sales of AI cockpit solutions.

OEM and Other revenue was $194 million, up 36% from a year ago and up 33% sequentially, primarily due to higher
volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.

Gross margin was 62.6% in the third quarter, down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 380 basis points
sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects charges related to the Mellanox acquisition and lower margins in
Gaming, partially offset by a shift in product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive sales. The
sequential increase was primarily driven by the absence of a non-recurring inventory step-up expense related to the
Mellanox acquisition in the prior quarter.

Operating expenses were $1.56 billion, up 58% from a year earlier and down 4% sequentially. The year-on-year
increase was primarily driven by compensation-related costs, the Mellanox acquisition, infrastructure costs, and
employee growth. The sequential decrease was due to a reduction in acquisition-related costs.

Income from operations was $1.40 billion, up 51% from a year earlier and up 115% sequentially. Net income was $1.34
billion. Net income per diluted share was $2.12, up 46% from a year earlier and up 114% sequentially.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter were $10.14 billion, up from $9.77
billion a year earlier and down from $10.98 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily
reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cash flow generation, partially offset by
acquisitions. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the $2 billion payment under the Purchase Agreement to
acquire Arm.

We paid $99 million in quarterly cash dividends in the third quarter.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses
and related disclosure of contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Our management has discussed the development
and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and
estimates in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Due to the Mellanox acquisition, we added the following critical
accounting policy:
                                                                                                                   
   Business Combinations                                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price
exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly
intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In
certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions
and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly,
the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and
circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period
adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been
recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business
combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible
arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and
sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract,
asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and
trade name acquired in a business combination and IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired
intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain
estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration
curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical
data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the
risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility.

There have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” to the condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional details. In addition, please refer to Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies
and estimates.

Graphics - Graphics segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter of
fiscal year 2020 increased by 25% and revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first
nine months of fiscal year 2020 increased by 22%. These increases reflect growth in GeForce GPUs and game console
SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro workstations.

Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to
the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 increased by 146% and revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021

Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new
products, partially offset by lower autonomous driving development agreement revenue.

quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual
countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to
end customers in a different location.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year
2021. One customer represented 10% and 11% of our total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2020, respectively, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.
                                                                                                                   
  Gross Margin                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
Our overall gross margin decreased to 62.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 from 63.6% for the third
quarter of fiscal year 2020, reflecting charges related to the Mellanox acquisition and lower margins in Gaming,
partially offset by a shift in product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive sales. Our overall gross
margin increased to 62.0% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 from 60.8% for the first nine months of
fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by Mellanox products, lower Automotive sales and lower product costs within
Compute & Networking, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related costs including a non-recurring inventory
step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $171 million.

Inventory provisions totaled $15 million and $42 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $29 million and $78 million for
the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross
margin was a favorable impact of 0.3% and 1.2% in the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Inventory provisions totaled $96 million and $114 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or -down totaled $116 million and $109 million for
the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross
margin was a favorable impact of 0.2% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 and an unfavorable impact of
0.1% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:

Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared
to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by a shift in product mix and higher product costs. The
gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the
first nine months of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by lower legacy infotainment sales and product mix within
Quadro.

Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020,
primarily driven by Mellanox products and lower product costs.

Research and development expenses increased by 47% and 33% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal
year 2021, compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven
by expenses related to the Mellanox acquisition. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation
and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.

Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 86% and 78% during the third quarter and first nine months
of fiscal year 2021, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by Mellanox
acquisition-related expenses. In addition to Mellanox, increases reflect employee compensation and related costs,
including stock-based compensation.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income
was $7 million and $45 million during the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $50
million and $137 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in
interest income was primarily due to lower interest earned on our investments.

Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September
2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $53 million and $13 million during the third quarter of
fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $131 million and $39 million during the first nine months of fiscal
years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
                                                                                                                   
  Income Taxes                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
We recognized an income tax expense of $12 million and $64 million for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2021, respectively, and $60 million and $109 million for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2020, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 0.9% and
2.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021, respectively, and 6.3% and 5.6% for the third
quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2020, respectively.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2021 as compared
to the same periods of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings
subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

As of October 25, 2020, we had $10.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of
$758 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed
income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our
portfolio.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was
allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual
property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment
resulted in $1.36 billion advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for
the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and
$0.47 billion prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first
nine months of fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes
in working capital include increases in outstanding trade receivables, purchases of inventory, and a prepayment of
royalties to Arm.

Cash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided
in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox
and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities,
higher maturities of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and
lower sales of marketable securities.

Cash provided by financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used
in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2021 and payments related to tax on restricted stock units.

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash
generated by our operations. As of October 25, 2020, we had $10.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies,
highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of
deposits. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient
liquidity to meet our operating requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

We have approximately $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that we have not accrued
any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the United States. Other than that, as a
result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities held outside of the
                                                        33

  Capital Return to Shareholders                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
In the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we paid $296 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend
program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing
determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of
our shareholders.

As of October 25, 2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of
our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first nine
months of fiscal year 2021.
                                                                                                                   
  Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040,
$2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March
2020 Notes. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $4.97 billion, after deducting debt discounts and
issuance costs.

In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due
2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion,
after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.

We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can
obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of October 25, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts under
this agreement.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 25, 2020, we
had not issued any commercial paper.

As of October 25, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations.
                                                                                                                   
  Contractual Obligations                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
There are $155 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized
tax benefits of $310 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $46 million recorded in non-current
income tax payable as of October 25, 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax
liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax
positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by
the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course
of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended January 26, 2020. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 26, 2020 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our long-term debt,
purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.

Based on their evaluation as of October 25, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
                                                                                                                   
   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting                                                            
                                                                                                                   
Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting
despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are
continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on
their operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control
environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control
over financial reporting during this integration.
                                                                                                                   
   Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously
described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020 and Item 1A of
our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 26, 2020 and July 26, 2020.

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but
not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
26, 2020 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 26, 2020 and July
26, 2020. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to
us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic
investments, including the Mellanox and Arm acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate
acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that
offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products,
strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion on April
27, 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all of the allotted and issued ordinary shares
of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the Arm acquisition and other past or
future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow
our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth
or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has
opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of
entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to
the Mellanox acquisition, the Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not
limited to:

• difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our
business;

• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;

• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of
acquired assets;

• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;

• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;

• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating
international operations and joint ventures;

• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;

• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other
approvals or financing;

• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for
an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;

• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;

• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;

• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
                                                        36                                                         
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target
operate;

• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or
company; and

• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result
of our acquisition or investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce. COVID-19 has resulted in
government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and
restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further
impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective
vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business
operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers, are
located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been
affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, our
Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play
from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform experienced stronger demand for mobile workstations due
to work from home trends, but was negatively affected by lower corporate demand for desktop workstations. Industry
production volume returned to pre-COVID levels in our Auto market platform, but these production volumes may be
further impacted by COVID-19. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in
sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand
globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, which could cause us to order
an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or
at all.

The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Korea. Additionally, a
significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Each of these countries
has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it. There is considerable uncertainty
regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing
facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such
measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost
of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet
customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-
from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take
further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our
employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees in the third quarter continued to work
remotely. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease,
and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.

In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in
particular is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in,
significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our
customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession
or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall
technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to
change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including
our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future
developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the
actions to contain the
                                                        37                                                         
disease or treat its impact, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the
impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and
cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of
liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,
outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions,
cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and
other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these
disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our
costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in
order to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic
continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in
California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located
in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data
center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business
disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our
products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China,
Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through
Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may
result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could
impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In
particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased
taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or
exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example,
regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans.
Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services
for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political
developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election
developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability
globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability or adverse political
developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other
operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water
shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental,
public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other
suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in
certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event
affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in
revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these
risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.

Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.

Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a
total cost of $7.08 billion through October 25, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed
into treasury stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share
repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to
acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

In the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we paid $296 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of October 25,
2020, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up
to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during the first nine months of fiscal
year 2021.

We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations
upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the third
quarter of fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 1 million shares at a total cost of $298 million through net
share settlements. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 2 million shares at
a total cost of $716 million through net share settlements.
