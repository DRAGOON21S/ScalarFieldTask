Adoption of Fiscal Year 2026 Variable Compensation Plan

On March 3, 2025, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Board, of NVIDIA Corporation, or the
Company, adopted the Variable Compensation Plan for Fiscal Year 2026, or the 2026 Plan, which provides eligible
executive officers the opportunity to earn a variable cash payment based on the level of achievement by the Company
of certain corporate performance goals, or the Performance Goals, during fiscal year 2026. The Company operates on
a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January and designates its fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal
year ends. Fiscal year 2026 refers to the Company’s fiscal year ending January 25, 2026.

The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2026 based upon the achievement of
specified fiscal year 2026 revenue and has established threshold compensation plan, base compensation plan, and
stretch compensation plan levels.

Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the
payment date under the 2026 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.

The following table sets forth the respective target award opportunities for base compensation plan achievement for
the Company’s named executive officers under the 2026 Plan:
