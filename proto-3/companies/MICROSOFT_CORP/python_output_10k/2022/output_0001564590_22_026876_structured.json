We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other\nintelligent devices, and related accessories.\nThe Ambitions That Drive Us\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\nReinvent productivity and business processes.\nBuild the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.\nCreate more personal computing.\nReinvent Productivity and Business Processes\nAt Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.\nOur family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and\ncollaboration tools and services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together\nOffice 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-\nbacked tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance\ncoverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat,\ncollaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings\ntogether communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights powered by Microsoft 365. Together with the\nMicrosoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and Azure Synapse bring a new era of collaborative applications\nthat transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive\nproductivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business\nintelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn,\ngrow, and get hired.\nBuild the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent EdgePlatform\nAs digital transformation accelerates, organizations in every sector across the globe can address challenges that\nwill have a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes\noperations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a\nproven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to\nMicrosoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted\ncloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at\nsignificantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer,\ngeographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network\nresources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the\ntechnology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a\nglobal-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted\nsecurity and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are\naccelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things (“IoT”)\nsensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack,\norganizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and\nthe intelligent edge.\n4\nPART I\nItem 1\nOur hybrid infrastructure consistency spanssecurity, compliance,identity,andmanagement, helping to support the\nreal-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises.Our industry clouds\nbring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations, to\nimprove time to value, increase agility, and lower costs.Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by\ndelivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and\nmanagement underlie our entire tech stack. We offer integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and\norganizations.\nIn March 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”). Together, Microsoft and\nNuance will enable organizations across industries to accelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-\nbased solutions infused with powerful, vertically optimized AI.\nWe are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh\nenables presence and shared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. The opportunity to merge\nthe physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks new workloads and\nexperiences to create common understanding and drive more informed decisions.\nThe ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for\ncustomers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize\nbuilt-in AI. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics in\na comprehensive solution. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation\nhelps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for\ncreating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI\nmodeling and data science. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter\nthe technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform.\nAdditionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing cloud computing to space. Azure\nOrbital is a fully managed ground station as a service for fast downlinking of data.\nCreate More Personal Computing\nWe strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to\ninteract with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and\norganizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working, learning, and playing.\nWindows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business with Windows 365, a desktop operating system\nthat’s also a cloud service. From another internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, you can\nrun Windows 365, just like a virtual machine.\nWith Windows 11, we have simplified the design and experience to empower productivity and inspire creativity.\nWindows 11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity and is designed to support hybrid work. It adds new\nexperiences that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways\nto stay connected through Microsoft Teams chat; the information you want at your fingertips; and more. Windows 11\nsecurity and privacy features include operating system security, application security, and user and identity\nsecurity.\nTools like search, news, and maps have given us immediate access to the world’s information. Today, through our\nSearch, News, Mapping, and Browse services, Microsoft delivers unique trust, privacy, and safety features.\nMicrosoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed\nto save you time and money. Organizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help make\nthe most of your time while browsing, streaming, searching, and sharing.\nWe are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device\ncategories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Laptop Studio,\nSurface Laptop 4, Surface Laptop Go 2, Surface Laptop Pro 8, Surface Pro X, Surface Go 3, Surface Studio 2, and\nSurface Duo 2.\n5\nPART I\nItem 1\nWith three billion people actively playing games today,anda new generation steeped in interactive entertainment,\nMicrosoft continuestoinvest in content, community, and cloud services. Wehave broadenedour approach to how we think\nabout gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including cloud\ngaming so players can streamacross PC, console, and mobile.We have a strong positionwithour large and growing\nhighly engaged community of gamers, including theacquisition ofZeniMaxMedia Inc., the parent company of Bethesda\nSoftworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard,Inc., a leader\ningamedevelopmentandan interactive entertainment content publisher.Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a\ncurated library of over100first- and third-partyconsole and PCtitles.Xbox Cloud Gamingis Microsoft’s game streaming\ntechnology that is complementary to our console hardware andgivesfans the ultimate choiceto play the games they\nwant, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\nOur Future Opportunity\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve\nproductivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent\nsolutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses\nand simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the\nlong term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\nTransforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and\nimprove how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\nBuilding and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for\nbusinesses and individuals.\nApplying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs\nusing natural methods of communication.\nTackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance,\nidentity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\nInventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any\ndevices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of\nentertainment.\nUsing Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement\nwith our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and\nsales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to\ndeliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\nCorporate Social Responsibility\nCommitment to Sustainability\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress\ntoward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers\nbuild sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we\nannounced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by\n2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion\nover four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments\nto be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We\nalso help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon\nfootprint.\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our\ngoals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased,\ndue in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the\nwork to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact\nof our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won’t always be linear.\n6\nPART I\nItem 1\nWhile fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that\nilluminate the diversity of our work include:\nWe purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon.\nFour of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.\nWe granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions\nthe world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration\nenergy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.\nWe joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal\nsector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030.\nSustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft\nCloud for Sustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon\nfootprint across their operations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call – an\ninitiative to mobilize collective action to solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero\nfuture.\nThe investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our\ndevices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and\ndatacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.\nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American\ncommunities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees’ communities, and beyond. Our Racial\nEquity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or\nexceed by 2025.\nStrengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black\nand African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.\nEvolving our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster\nsocietal change and create new opportunities.\nIncreasing representation and strengthening inclusion: build on our momentum, adding a $150 million\ninvestment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx\nleaders in the United States by 2025.\nOver the last year, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and\nscale a number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice\nReform Initiative, expanding access to affordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities\nand key institutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support\nBlack and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support\nfor nonprofits that provide critical services to Black and African American communities.\nWe have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. We are 90 percent of the way to our\n2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors,\nand senior leaders in the U.S., and 50 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior\nindividual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S.\nWe exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned\nfinancial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository\ninstitutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline,\nreaching more than 90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African\nAmerican-owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth\nInitiative and continue to invest in the partner community through the Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting\nevents focused on business growth, accelerators, and mentorship.\nProgress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity.\nWe are committed to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to\nhold ourselves accountable to accelerate change – for Microsoft, and beyond.\n7\nPART I\nItem 1\nInvesting in Digital Skills\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to record unemployment, disrupting livelihoods of people around the world. After helping\nover 30 million people in 249 countries and territories with our global skills initiative, we introduced a new\ninitiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to\ndevelop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning\nresources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is\nbuilt on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. We previously invested $20 million in key non-profit\npartnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people from underserved communities that are often excluded\nby the digital economy.\nWe also launched a national campaign with U.S. community colleges to help skill and recruit into the cybersecurity\nworkforce 250,000 people by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making\ncurriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s public community colleges, providing training for new\nand existing faculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000\nstudents.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster\ntheir and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work,\nwhere they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met.\nWe strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and\ninclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our\nmission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 122,000 in the U.S. and 99,000\ninternationally. Of the total employed people, 85,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution,\nproduct support, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and\nmarketing; and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining\nagreements.\nOur Culture\nMicrosoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and\ngrow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious\n– trying new things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:\nObsessing over what matters to our customers.\nBecoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.\nOperating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.\nMaking a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us.\nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and\nemployee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2022 Employee\nSignals survey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning\nand development. Throughout the fiscal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During\nfiscal year 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to\nEmployee Signals and Daily Pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership,\nperformance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service\nsupport.\n8\nPART I\nItem 1\nDiversity and Inclusion\nAt Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet\nto achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact\neconomies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different\nset of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better\nwe represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower.\nWe strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our\nworkplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone\nthe chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active\nEmployee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and\nemployees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As\ndescribed in our 2021 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team\ninclude an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time,\nwe publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including:\nDetailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with\ndata by job types, levels, and segments of our business.\nOur EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).\nDisability representation.\nPay equity (see details below).\nTotal Rewards\nWe develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly\ndifferentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These\nprograms reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend\nrewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our\ncolleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions.\nAs part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock\neligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and\nexempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and\nretail employees. In response to the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in\nannual merit and annual stock award opportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested\nin base salary adjustments for our datacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S.\nThese investments have supported retention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice.\nPay Equity\nIn our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S.\ncombined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for\nevery $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our twelve other\nlargest employee geographies representing 86.6% of our global population (Australia, Canada, China, France,\nGermany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) combined earn $1.001 for every\n$1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters\nour culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.\nWellness and Safety\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being and safety while they are at work and in their\npersonal lives.\nWe took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in shifting to return to office and/or hybrid\narrangements. We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to\nidentify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems.\n9\nPART I\nItem 1\nWe have invested significantly in holistic wellbeing,andoffer a differentiatedbenefits packagewhichincludes many\nphysical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee\nAssistance Program,mental wellbeing support,flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption\nassistance, and back-up care for children and elders.Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps\nensure employees can stay safe while they are working.\nWe continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with\nemergency relocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits.\nLearning and Development\nOur growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing – seeking out new ideas, driving innovation,\nembracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide\nrange of learning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our\nlearning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities\ninclude:\nPersonalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning\nportal Learning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS Learn are available\nto all employees worldwide.\nIn-the-classroom learning, learning cohorts, our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence\ncommunities.\nRequired learning for all employees and managers on topics such as compliance, regulation, company culture,\nleadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training.\nOn-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities.\nManagers holding conversations about employees’ career and development plans, coaching on career\nopportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship.\nCustomized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build\nleadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs.\nNew employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, and culture, as well as\nongoing onboarding programs.\nNew tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the new\nflexible hybrid world of work. These include quick guides for teams to use, such as Creating Team\nAgreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running Effective Hybrid Meetings.\nOur employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as\nthousands of informal and on-the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in\nfiscal year 2022 our employees completed over 4.7 million courses, averaging over 14 hours per employee. Given our\nfocus on understanding core company beliefs and compliance topics, all employees complete required learning\nprograms like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment courses. Our\ncorporate learning portal has over 100,000 average monthly active users. We have over 27,000 people managers, all\nof whom must complete between 20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned\nongoing required training each year. In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession\nthey are in each year.\nNew Ways of Working\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. We introduced a\nHybrid Workplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working\nthat shift paradigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows\nemployees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun\nreturning to worksites as conditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of\nworkweeks working at home, another site, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety\nof workstyles where individuals, teams, and our business can deliver success.\n10\nPART I\nItem 1\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business\nProcesses, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive\nfinancial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the\ndevelopment, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational\nallocation of resources within businesses.\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 –\nSegment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\nOur reportable segments are described below.\nProductivity and Business Processes\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms.

LinkedIn\nrevenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to\nTalentSolutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality\nof the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\nDynamics\nDynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource\nplanning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and other application\ndevelopment platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises.\nDynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue\nper user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications,\nincluding Power Apps and Power Automate.\nCompetition\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google,\nIBM, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as\nlocal application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email\nand calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise\ncommunications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and\nproductivity suite. Slack provides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers videoconferencing and cloud\nphone solutions. Okta, Proofpoint, and Symantec provide security solutions across email security, information\nprotection, identity, and governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also\npositioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible,\nsecure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create\ncomprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the\ncloud.\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies,\nand larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional\nrecruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions\ncompetes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions\ncompetes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.\n12\nPART I\nItem 1\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that\ncan power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\nServer products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server,\nVisual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.\nEnterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance\nprofessional services.\nServer Products and Cloud Services\nAzure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to\nbuild, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global\nnetwork of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive\nservices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of\napplications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure\nrevenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and\nper user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and\nefficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software\napplications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business\nintelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security,\nand identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects,\ndevelopers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for\ndevelopers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses\nsold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to\ncertain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated\nserver product.\nNuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI\nsolutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\nEnterprise Services\nEnterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance Professional\nServices, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop\nsolutions, and Nuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and\ncertification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\nCompetition\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source\nofferings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors\nincluding identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s\ncompetitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public\ncloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses\nof all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity\nand security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and\ndifferentiates us from the competition.\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by\ncompanies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard,\nIBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all\ncomputer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating\nsystem development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible\napplications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as\nRed Hat, supply versions of Linux.\n13\nPART I\nItem 1\nWe compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software\nvendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both\nInternet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of\ncompanies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing\nsolutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments\ninclude CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes withopen sourcesoftware\nsuch as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM,\nOracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and\nserver virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our\nproducts for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also\nagainst open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby\non Rails.\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and\nproductivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware\nand software applications, security, and manageability.\nOur Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business\nplanning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small\nniche businesses focused on specific technologies.\nMore Personal Computing\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\nWindows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows\noperating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows\ncloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\nDevices, including Surface and PC accessories.\nGaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content\n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming,\nthird-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.\nSearch and news advertising.\nWindows\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling\nconsistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted\nsignificantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the\ndevices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\nThe mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\nDifferences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\nAttachment of Windows to devices shipped.\nCustomer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\nChanges in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\nPricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts\nfrom local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows\nversions licensed.\nConstraints in the supply chain of device components.\nPiracy.\n14\nPART I\nItem 1\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud\nservices such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for\nvolume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue\noften reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the\nnumber of PCs sold in a given year.\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas,\nincluding mobile devices and cloud offerings.\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating\nsystems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.\nDevices\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and\norganizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products\nand services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in\nDevices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and\nexpanding into new categories.\nGaming\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content,\ncommunity, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party\nstudios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and\ncontent to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the\ncornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over\n100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage\nboth on- and off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued\ninvestment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and\non-demand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorite games\nwith them and play on the device most convenient to them.\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-\nenabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified\napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large\ncustomer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as\nwell as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox\nenabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power\nand reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences\nthrough first-party content creators.\nSearch and News Advertising\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to\na global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and\nmonetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent\nwith relevant content and advertiser offerings.\nOn June 6, 2022, we acquired Xandr, Inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our\ndigital advertising solutions.\nCompetition\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from\nApple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security,\nan easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including\nthose that enable productivity.\n15\nPART I\nItem 1\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination\nof high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers,\nmany of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming\nservices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other\nproviders of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console\nplatforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming\nplatform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services\nbased on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and\nentertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as\nother digital content offerings.\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like\nMeta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\nOPERATIONS\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order\nprocessing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional\ncenter in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the\nJapan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale,\nFlorida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to\nthe operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well\nas in the Middle East and Africa.\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in\ninternational markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a\nproduct may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we\nhave the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our\nrequirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified\nsuppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current\nvendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or\nmanufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer\ndemand.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\nCloud and AI, focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and\nefficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development\ntools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and\nservices for enterprises.\nExperiences and Devices, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and\ndevices, including Office, Windows, Teams, consumer web experiences (including search and news advertising),\nand the Surface line of devices.\nSecurity, Compliance, Identity, and Management, focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity\nand network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\nTechnology and Research, focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development\nefforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\nLinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\nGaming, focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow\nour user base through game experiences and social interaction.\n16\nPART I\nItem 1\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer\ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as\npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before\nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide\napplication vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we\nalso create product documentation internally.\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and\ninternationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply\nto our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology\ncompanies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued\nand over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property\nexclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies\nthat are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements\nwith other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that\nwe incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at\nno or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability,\nsupporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community.\nOur increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights\nbroadly in certain situations.\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products,\nservices, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses\ngenerally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product\ndevelopment are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to\nthe development of our products.\nInvesting in the Future\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users,\nto initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive\nbroad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs\nthat we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based\non our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across\na wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing,\nAI, devices, and operating systems.\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us\nremain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development\nactivities, and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and\nleverage the results across the Company.\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research\nis one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top\nuniversities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other\ndisciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation.\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors\nand resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial\nenterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital\ntransformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software\nvendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment\nfunctions for our products and services.\n17\nPART I\nItem 1\nOEMs\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they\nsell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also\nsell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and\nthe capability to subscribe to Office 365.\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them\nis managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one\nor more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and\nwith many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume\nPC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through\nthe Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\nDirect\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements\nand Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web\nagencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement\nSoftware Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate\ncustomers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support\nmany of these sales.\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search,\nand gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store\nphysical locations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to\nfacilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\nDistributors and Resellers\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners\n(“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may\nreach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell\nprimarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as\nLSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our\nmain partner program for reselling cloud services.\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized\nreplicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail\noutlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives\nand field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and\nsales support.\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners\nproviding vertical solutions and specialized services.\nLICENSING OPTIONS\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We\nlicense software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple\nlicenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use\ndifferent programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may\ndiffer in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also\nprovides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software\nefficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\n18\nPART I\nItem 1\nVolume Licensing Programs\nEnterprise Agreement\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the\nflexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for\nmedium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a\nthree-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.\nMicrosoft Customer Agreement\nA Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital\nexperience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers\nover time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement\nA Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement isdesigned for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to,\nactivate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows\ncustomers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreement\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license\ncloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-\nexpiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for\ncustomers that purchase perpetual licenses.\nOpen Value\nOpen Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements\nare designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a\nthree-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe\nto licenses and SA is included.\nSelect Plus\nA Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at\nany affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual\nlicenses and SA is optional.\nPartner Programs\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need\nin combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or\ncloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly\nprovision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors\nwho want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to\ntheir end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on\nconsumption.\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other\napplications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.\n19\nPART I\nItem 1\nCUSTOMERS\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector\ninstitutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products\npromptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\n20\nPART I\nItem 1\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUREXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOur executive officers as of July 28, 2022 were as follows:\nName                        Age    Position with the Company\nSatya Nadella                54    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nJudson Althoff               49    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer\nChristopher C. Capossela     52    Executive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief\nMarketing Officer\nKathleen T.

          "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described\nbelow, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the\ntrading price of our common stock.\nSTRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or\noperating margins.\nCompetition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources\nto small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical,\nmarketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in\nwhich we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent\nintroductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making\ninnovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants\ncan build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the\nmarketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms\nthat provide competing platforms.\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements\nof a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers,\ntablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model\nalso earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications\nand content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and\nperformance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated\nhardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a\nvertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant\ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and\ntablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the\ndevice and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the\npast were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a\npersonal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application\ndevelopers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost\nmay decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms\ncould increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by\nour original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\nCompeting platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases.\nThe variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device\npurchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching\nplatforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and\nensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete\nwith competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\noperating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our\nability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model\nobjectives.\n23\nPART I\nItem 1A\nBusiness model competition\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business\nmodel, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue.\nWe bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and\ndevelopment, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our\ncompetitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by\nselling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these\ncompetitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost\nto end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not\nbear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software\nmimics the features and functionality of our products.\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased\noperating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower\nrevenue, gross margins, and operating income.\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.A growing part of our\nbusiness involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is\nto compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an\nintelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly\ndeveloping and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are\nevolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice\nof which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based\nstrategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and\norganizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and\nintelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT\nwill depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere.\nWe may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed\nin cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market\nshare.\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of\ncomputing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as\nsensors and other IoT endpoints.\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the\nsecurity of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and\necosystems, including those of our competitors.\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we\nare not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate\ninnovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in\nline with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins\nand operating income.\n24\nPART I\nItem 1A\nRISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.We will continue to\nmake significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and\ntechnologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server,\nAzure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and\nacquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets,\ngaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many\nfactors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not\nperceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their\npurchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve\nsignificant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.\nNew products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new\nproducts and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get\nengagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data\nhandling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of\nmismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences,\ncould negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in\nnew releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.We expect to\ncontinue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term\nbusiness strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion,\nand inMarch 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022we\nannounced a definitive agreement to acquireActivision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion.These acquisitions and other\ntransactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our\nbusiness strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related\nobligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and\ntechnology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be\ncompleted. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may\nresult in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements\nwill depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop\ncompelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as\ndata governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from\nthese transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may\nultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge\nto earnings.We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from\nthose acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable\nintangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances,\nindicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include\na decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates\nin industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to\nrecord, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of\nour goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\n25\nPART I\nItem 1A\nCYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm\nto our reputation or competitive position.\nSecurity of our information technology\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated\norganizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose\nthreats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing\nand deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in\norder to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering\ntechniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive\ninformation or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a\ncoordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-\nsponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against us\nor our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict\nin Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For\nexample, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate.\nEmployees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal\nconfidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software\nupdates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\nCyberthreats are constantly evolvingand becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty\nof detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain\nvulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can\nhave cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our\npartners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our\nsystems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy\nof their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information\nharming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other\nassets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or\nremediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “Solorigate” or “Nobelium” are an example of a supply chain attack\nwhere malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates. The\nattackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems. We\nmay be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT.\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and\ntechnologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers\nusing methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and\ninternal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity\nregulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\n26\nPART I\nItem 1A\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products\nor servicesacross cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies\nlike us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT\ninfrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our\ninfrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our\nservices and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating\nsystems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries\ncan attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”)\nvulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises\nproducts. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if\ncustomers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before\npatching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to\nattack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire\nuser account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share\nthe same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized\naccess, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our\nproducts or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be\nvulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks.\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may\ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and\nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a\nresult, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature\nsolely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and\nstandards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and\ntechnical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help\nthem adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account\nfor this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services,\nincluding security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations\nand some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\nCyberattacks such as Solorigate/Nobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not\ndirectly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become\naware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to\nproviding guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence\nor extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack,\nespecially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited\nvisibility into our customers’ computing environments.\nDevelopment and deployment of defensive measures\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’\nsystems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability\nfeatures, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as\nwell as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even\nwhen software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of\nour network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and\nadvanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers\nin certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized\nrequirements to which we must engineer our products and services.\n27\nPART I\nItem 1A\nThe cost ofmeasures to protect products and customer-facing servicescould reduce our operating margins. If we fail\nto do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption\nissues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of\nproducts or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on\nprotecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or\nservices. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue\nto run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security\npatches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our\nreputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements\ntypically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these\nprovisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into\nagreements with larger liability exposureto customers.\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of\nthird parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit\ntargeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or\ncompetitive position.\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.As we continue to grow the\nnumber, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of\npersonal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence\nof an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the\nsecurity controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal\ndata, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent\nthe improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third\nparties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper\ndisclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to\nliability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software\nproducts and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or,\nincreasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce\ncustomer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency\nconcerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our\nefforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal\ninformation is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit\nadoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security\nmeasures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and\nhow to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause\nhigher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other\nMicrosoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or\ntechnical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use\nof this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third\nparties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for\ntheir own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.\nAbuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\nAdvertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third\nparties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our\nreputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This\nactivity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, dissemination of information that may be\nviewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services\nthat violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to\nthese actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not\nbe successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n28\nPART I\nItem 1A\nOther digitalsafetyabuses\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal\ncontent in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the\nlimitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users, such content may\nnegatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make\nplatforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to\ncontinue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage\nif we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the\nintelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the\nIoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities\nincluding AI. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain\ndefects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An\nIoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may\nnot develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many\nIoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts\nof data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may\nincreasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as\nintended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement\nactions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact\nour revenues or margins.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm or liability. We are building AI into many\nof our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making first- and third-party AI available\nfor our customers to use in solutions that they build. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We\nenvision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more\nproductive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could\naffect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or\ncontain biased information. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others\ncould result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These\ndeficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal\nliability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union\n(“EU”), and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI\nsolutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social,\neconomic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an\nadequate operations infrastructure.Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our\nproducts and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease\ndatacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our\nwebsites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies, the cost or\navailability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean\nenergy economy and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and\nservices and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft\n365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly\ngrowing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their\nend users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires\ndevelopment of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. It requires that we\nmaintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable\nwithin competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures,\nincluding temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage\nand compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in\ncontractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation,\nand loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n29\nPART I\nItem 1A\nWemay experience quality or supply problems.Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other\ndevices wedesignand market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software.\nWe could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or\nproduct liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty\nrepairs.\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated\nsoftware we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers\nincreasingly rely on us for critical business functionsand multiple workloads. Many of our products and services\nare interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or\nreliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and\nrevenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions,\nor legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our\nexposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same\nsuppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are\ndelayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or\nregulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies,\nresulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or\nprice reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface\ndevices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to\ndisruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our\nproducts.As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and\nforeign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes\nscrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow\ncompetitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities\nhave previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nThe European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the\nterms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces,\nand protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant\nscrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our\nWindows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with\nspecifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In\n2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to\ncompetition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to\ninteroperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to\ninnovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and\nincrease our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may\nenable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could\nhamper sales of our products.\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of\ndevices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating\na risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase.\nCertain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their\ncompetition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n30\nPART I\nItem 1A\nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to\nprovide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and\nthe revenue that comesfrom them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions\nas precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of\nways, including:\nWe may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and\ndeveloping alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a\ndelay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.\nWe may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect\ntheir fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property.\nWe are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent\ndecrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur\nlitigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions.\nOur ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.\nRegulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the\nultimate value of such transactions.\nOur global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and\nregulations.The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-\nCorruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of\nthe FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we\nreceive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and\nothers about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically,\nwe receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign\nlaw enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower\nDirective, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different\nforms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors\nfrom colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial\nresources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal\ncontrols designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents\nmay violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in\nsignificant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the\nconduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and\noutside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries\nprohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.\nU.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments\nin, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information\nand communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving\ninformation and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Periods of intense\ndiplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving\nsanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2)\nnegative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions\nas well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines,\nloss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\n31\nPART I\nItem 1A\nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings includerequirements related\ntouser privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection,advertising,and online content. For example, some\nregulators are taking the position that our offerings such asMicrosoftTeams and Skype are covered by existing laws\nregulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including EU Member State laws under the European\nElectronic Communications Code,are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services.This\ntrend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and\nlaw enforcement surveillance obligations.Regulatorsmay assert that our collection, use, and management of\ncustomerdataand otherinformationis inconsistent with their laws and regulations,including laws that apply to the\ntracking of users via technology such as cookies. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity\nrequirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.\nLegislativeandregulatory actionis emergingin the areasof AI and content moderation,which could increasecosts\norrestrictopportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over\ntime, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’\napproach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types\nof regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in\nreduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged\nnoncompliant activity.\nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an\nimportant aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors,\ncustomers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer\nexpectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal\nactions.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in\nincreased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based\nservices internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements\nrelating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in\nJuly 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer\ndata from EU member states to the United States. This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal\nrequirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data\nprotection authorities blocking the use of U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The\nU.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the\nTrans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. A failure of the U.S. and EU to finalize the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy\nFramework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. Potential new rules\nand restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our\nproducts and services in some markets. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to\nall of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the\nEU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has\nbeen developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital\nServices Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products\nand services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws\ninvolve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience\nreduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our\ncustomers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with\nthe GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular\nregulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply\n(including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can\nresult in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational\ndamage,blockage of international data transfers,and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have\nrecently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as\nChina, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations\nimposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data.\n32\nPART I\nItem 1A\nThe Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver\nto customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality,\nand operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that\nimpede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by\nregulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or\ninconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location,\nmovement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business\npractices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater\ndifficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to\ninnovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate.Failure to comply with\nexisting or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as\nwell as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.We are subject to a variety of claims\nand lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new\nproduct releases such as Windows, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment\npractices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive\nrelief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject\nto inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse\nimpact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable\noutcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from\ngovernment contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private\ncommercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these\ncontracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines\nand penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government\nto terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be\nsubject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for\nour products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and\nreputation.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our\nbusiness, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For\nexample, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative\nchanges may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates\nin our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its\nprovisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and\nas we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may\nmaterially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision\nfor income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have\ntaken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make\nresolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior\ntax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits,\nand other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and\nmay materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is\nmade.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in\ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or\ndisputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the\nCompany. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate\nmultinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S.,\nand changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may\nmaterially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n33\nPART I\nItem 1A\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.Source code, the\ndetailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business.\nAlthough we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take\nsignificant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we\nmight lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete\nwith our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.\nUnauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk\nfactors.\nLegal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual\nproperty. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and\nother intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact\non revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides\nless protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the\nunderlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure\nconsistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing\ngenuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers\nabout the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the\nlegal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.\nWe expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will\ngenerate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by\nlicensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate.\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue\nfor licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to\nobtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of\nour patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their\nobligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution\nof technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the\ndifficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also\ncause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact\nrevenue.\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.From time to time, others claim we infringe\ntheir intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in\nthe markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance\nof new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims, we may enter\ninto royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or\nredesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers.\nThese outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can\nseek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that\nhave infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties\nhave fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims\nrelated to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as\npart of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\nGENERAL RISKS\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and\nbrands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or\nbrands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and\nsustainability,supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers,\ngovernment entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering\ndecisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners\ndo not like.\n34\nPART I\nItem 1A\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\nData security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\nThe proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If\nour brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the\nmost highly qualified employees.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.Worsening economic conditions, including inflation,\nrecession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our\nrevenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for\nthose products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run\nour software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners,\nsuch as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they\nhave purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to\ngeneral credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events\nthat affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government\nsecurities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government\ncredit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely\naffected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring\nimpairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.A disruption or failure of our systems or\noperations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other\ncatastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical\nfunctions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and\ncertain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business\noperations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic\nevent that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the\ninfrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business\noperations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience\nof our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of\nprolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a\nrisk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively\nimpact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add\nuncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply\nchain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and\nrequirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and\nglobal markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to\ndo business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our\nrevenues.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as COVID-19 may adversely affect our operations,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and\nunpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. The extent to which\nglobal pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the\npandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic\nactivity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.\n35\nPART I\nItem 1A\nMeasures to containa global pandemicmayintensifyother risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of\nthesemeasuresmay adversely impact our ability to:\nMaintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services.\nSatisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such\nas through datacenter load balancing.\nEnsure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and\ndatacenter operations.\nEffectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies.\nHire and deploy people where we most need them.\nSustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering,\nand distribution functions.\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may\nadversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear.\nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may\naffect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business.\nChanges in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to\ndevelop software and provide cloud-based services.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.Our customers are located throughout the world and\na significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates\noperational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and\nlocal economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes.\nIn addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents\nseveral risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region,\nand difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trendsand\nconcerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and\ncommercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic\nnationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export\ncontrols, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in\nforeign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for\nour products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency\nexposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.Our business is based on successfully\nattracting and retaining talented employeesrepresenting diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The\nmarket for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and\nreputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are\nimportant to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit\ninternationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the\nflow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development\nefforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key\nleaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective\nsuccession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge\nand smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-\nrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and\nless flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is primarily non-unionized, but we have\nseveral unions and works councils outside of the United States. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in\nworkers exercising their right to form or join a union. While Microsoft has not received such petitions in the\nU.S., the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational\nchanges necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\n36\nPART I\nItem 1B, 2, 3, 4",

          "content": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is\nintended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation.\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements\nand the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally\ndiscusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021.\nFor a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, please refer to Part II,\nItem 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to\nachieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our\nplatforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector\nefficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing\nand supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering\nrelevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating\nemployees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support\nof our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:\nMicrosoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth\nof 18%.\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers\ngrew to 59.7 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 34%.\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of\n45%.\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 11%.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.\nXbox content and services revenue increased 3%.\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.\nSurface revenue increased 3%.\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for a total purchase price\nof $18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software\nprovider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific\ncloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since\nthe date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 –\nBusiness Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further\ndiscussion.\nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.\nEach industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further\ntransform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad\nrange of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers\nand users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n40\nPART II\nItem 7\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services\nin the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue\nto evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in\ninfrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of\nuniversity and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional\nworking environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many\ndifferent products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software,\nservices, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain\ncomponents for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term\nflexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our\nrequirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in\nour ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange\nrates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign\ncurrencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in\nfiscal year 2022.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.\nSecond quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season\nspending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts\nexecuted during the period.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,\nIntelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis\nconsistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained\nin Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K).\nMetrics\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation\nof resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide\ntransparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our\ncommercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and\nservices. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the\ncorresponding period of last fiscal year.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain\nmetrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer\nand Server products and cloud services metrics and changes to align with how we manage our Windows OEM and Search\nand news advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our\nMD&A.\n41\nPART II\nItem 7\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance. Nuance is included in all\ncommercial metrics and our Server products and cloud services revenue growth metric. Azure and other cloud services\nrevenue includes Nuance cloud services, and Server products revenue includes Nuance on-premises offerings.\nCommercial\nOur commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows\nCommercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics.

Gains and losses from changes in fair\nvalues of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income\n(expense), net.\nInterest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a\ndecrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased\nprimarily due to lower gains on equity securities.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13% and 14%, respectively. The decrease in our effective\ntax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022\nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income\ntaxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme\nCourt decision on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The\nCommissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing,\nand final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico\nsubsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability\nfrom the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nWe have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit\nassessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals,\nsome dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were\nnot a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes.\nTherefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect\nthe results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit\nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting\nfrom producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in\nIreland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a\nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2022,\nour U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income\ntaxes was $36.1 billion.\n47\nPART II\nItem 7\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011.\nIn February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004\nto 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years\n2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In\nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to\n2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to\n2017.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have\na material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances\nfor income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key\ntransfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the\ninformation currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies\nfor these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax\nauthorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax benefit\nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax\nbenefit related to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance\nand help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial\nresults:\n(In millions, except percentages and per                                    Percentage\nshare amounts)                                   2022            2021       Change\nNet income                                  $  72,738       $  61,271       19%\nNet income tax benefit related to              (3,291  )            0       *\ntransfer of intangible properties\nNet income tax benefit related to India\nSupreme Court decision on withholding               0            (620  )    *\ntaxes\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)              $  69,447       $  60,651       15%\nDiluted earnings per share                  $    9.65       $    8.05       20%\nNet income tax benefit related to               (0.44  )            0       *\ntransfer of intangible properties\nNet income tax benefit related to India\nSupreme Court decision on withholding               0           (0.08  )    *\ntaxes\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share         $    9.21       $    7.97       16%\n(non-GAAP)\n*  Not meaningful.\n48\nPART II\nItem 7\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to\ncapital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing\nand financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and\nthe transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $104.8 billion and $130.3 billion as of June 30, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. Equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation.\nThey consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries\nand individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include\nforeign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest\nrate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to\nachieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these\ninvestments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-\ngrade fixed-income securities.\nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to\ndetermine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments,\nsuch as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices\nfor similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\nindirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes\nand bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with\nunobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs\nare an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as\nthese vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing\nwithout applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the\ninvestment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the\nmarket in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2\ninvestments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant\nadjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to\ndemonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include\ncontrols that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation,\nreview of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices\nwhere appropriate.\nCash Flows\nCash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in\ncash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in\nfinancing increased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in\ncommon stock repurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7\nbillion to $30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions\nof companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in\nadditions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment\npurchases, sales, and maturities.\n49\nPART II\nItem 7\nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit\nrating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general\ncorporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures,\nrepurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we\nexchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take\nadvantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate\nenvironment. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K)for\nfurther discussion.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software\nAssurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each\ncontract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also\nincludes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer\ncontrol of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part\nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022:\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ending\nSeptember 30, 2022     $  17,691\nDecember 31, 2022         13,923\nMarch 31, 2023             9,491\nJune 30, 2023              4,433\nThereafter                 2,870\nTotal                  $  48,408\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing\ntransaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the\ntransaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.\n50\nPART II\nItem 7\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of\nJune 30, 2022:\n(In millions)\nLong-term debt: (a)                             2023       Thereafter         Total\nPrincipal payments                         $   2,750    $      52,761    $   55,511\nInterest payments                              1,468           21,139        22,607\nConstruction commitments (b)                   7,942              576         8,518\nOperating and finance leases, including        4,609           44,045        48,654\nimputed interest (c)\nPurchase commitments (d)                      42,669            2,985        45,654\nTotal                                      $  59,438    $     121,506    $  180,944\n(a)  Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n(b)  Refer to Note 7 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K).\n(c)  Refer to Note 14 – Leases of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n(d)  Purchase commitments primarily relate to datacenters and include open purchase orders and take-or-pay\ncontracts that are not presented as construction commitments above.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously\nsubject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight\nyears, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We\nhave paid transition tax of $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. The remaining\ntransition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months.\nProvisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental\nexpenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental\nexpenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is\nconducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes\nto foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase\nunless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for\n$28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made\nusing cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program.\nRefer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K)\nfor further discussion.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. We intend to\ncontinue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of\nDirectors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K) for further discussion.\n51\nPART II\nItem 7\nOther Planned Uses of Capital\nOnJanuary 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision\nBlizzard”) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision\nBlizzard’s net cash.The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders, and we expect it to\nclose in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing\nconditions.\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of\ntechnology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property\nand equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in\ncoming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters,\ncorporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We\nhave not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons\nthat are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for\nfurther discussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that\ninvolve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition\nor results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of\ninvestment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and\ninventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service\nand recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of\nintegration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period\nin which the cloud services are provided.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation.\nWe use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold\nwith SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we\nsell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated\nbased on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately,\nwe determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and\nservices by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the\ncustomer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n52\nPART II\nItem 7\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimatedat contract\ninception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to\nour estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nImpairment of Investment Securities\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its\nfair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers,\nand the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In\nmaking this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative\nevidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse\nconditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the\nsecurity or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a\ndecline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost\nbasis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur\nfuture impairments.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative\nassessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying\nvalue. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the\ninvestment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an\nimpairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business\ncombination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a\nrelative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating\nsegment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate,\nlegal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a\nreporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated\nprimarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments,\nincluding estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term\nrate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination\nof our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating\nresults, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect\nthe determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until\ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established,\nsoftware costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is\nrequired in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that\ntechnological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been\nresolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.\nThe amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n53\nPART II\nItem 7\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An\nestimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it\nis probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree\nof probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.\nChanges in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the\ncurrent year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been\nrecognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax\nposition only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax\nassets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and\npenalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future\ntax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nVariations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes\nmaterials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable\nvalue is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly\nreview inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of\nour inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development\nplans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in\nutility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nCHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to\ninvestments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as\nadvances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network\nequipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year\n2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of\nJune 30, 2022, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $3.7 billion. We\nhad previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n54\nPART II\nItem 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that\nare presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s\nestimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at\nreasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the\nfinancial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for\nassets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of\nresponsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.\nThe Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company,\nmeets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to\nensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial\nreporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.\nSatya Nadella\nChief Executive Officer\nAmy E.

with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these\nprior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or\nconsolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nIntercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the\nstandalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment\nof goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and\nintangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-\nbased compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential\noutcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax\nreturns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may\ndiffer from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to\ninvestments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as wellas\nadvances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network\nequipment from to . This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had\npreviously increased the estimateduseful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet\ndate. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation\nadjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications,\nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and\nhardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related\naccessories.\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,\nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting\nservices. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n62\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts\nthat can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nNature of Products and Services\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made\navailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide\ncustomers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the\nsoftware. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software\nis made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the\nupdates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally\nratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with\nSoftware Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and\nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises\nlicenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally\nrecognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA\ncomprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of\nthe software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services\nprovided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the\ncustomer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and\ninterdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized\nover the period in which the cloud services are provided.\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the\naction necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services\nare provided.\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot\nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a\nsingle performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to\nresellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by\nsignificant product and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service\nand recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of\nintegration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period\nin which the cloud services are provided.\n63\nPART II\nItem 8\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software\nupdates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the\nproducts and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the\nrelative SSP of the various products and services.\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately,\nwe determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and\nservices by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the\ncustomer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain\ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract\ninception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to\nour estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when\nrevenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\nFor multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period.\nWe record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an\nunconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and\ncloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-\nyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for\nconsulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox\nsubscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have\nbeen paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in\nunearned revenue during the period.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our\ncontracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is\nto provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive\nfinancing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of\na subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses\nthat are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $ billion and $ million, respectively, and\nare included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ billion\nand $ billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts\nreceivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,andother\ncurrently available evidence.\n64\nPART II\nItem 8\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,                2022          2021          2020\nBalance, beginning of period    $   798       $   816       $   434\nCharged to costs and other          157           234           560\nWrite-offs                         (245  )       (252  )       (178  )\nBalance, end of period          $   710       $   798       $   816\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n(In millions)\nJune 30,                                    2022       2021       2020\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance    $   633    $   751    $   788\nfor doubtful accounts\nOther long-term assets                        77         47         28\nTotal                                    $   710    $   798    $   816\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products\nand services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nour financing receivables, net were $ billion and $ billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing\nreceivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance\nsheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and\nother currently available evidence.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of\nthose costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the\nrequirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods\npresented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the\namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation\nprogram and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with\nannual sales activities.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating\ncosts related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include\nsoftware on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire\nonline advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter\ncosts and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of\nconsulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software\ndevelopment costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\nProduct Warranty\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time\nthe related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any).\nThe specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which\nwe do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years.\nFor software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated\nlife of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty\nliabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\n65\nPART II\nItem 8\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other\nheadcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include\nthird-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international\nmarkets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software\ndevelopment are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is\nreached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once\ntechnological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the\nestimated lives of the products.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other\nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,\ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $\nbillion, $ billion, and $ billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units\n(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures,\nover the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our\ncommon stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.\nWe measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized\nusing the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is\nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax\npositions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.\nThe tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported\nnet of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred\nincome taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of\npurchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In\ngeneral, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than\none year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as\nshort-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of\ncash that is available for current operations.\n66\nPART II\nItem 8\nDebtinvestments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific\nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excludingcredit losses andimpairments, are recorded inother\ncomprehensive income.Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates\ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,\ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is\nless than cost.To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative\nand qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of,\nand business outlook for, the investee. Ifwe have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we\nwill be required to sell the security before recovery, thena decline in fair valuebelow cost is recorded asan\nimpairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.If market,\nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without\nreadily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for\nobservable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative\nassessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value\nof the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting\ndesignation.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income\n(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components\nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component\nof other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding\nhedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are\nprimarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value\nbased on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each\nof our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our\nLevel 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.\nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where\napplicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using\nmarket-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and\nforward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate\nnotes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain\nover-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n67\nPART II\nItem 8\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined\nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3\nassets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill\nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs\nused in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of\nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may\ninclude quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their\ncarrying values.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes\nmaterials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable\nvalue is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly\nreview inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of\nour inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a\nnew cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line\nmethod over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of\nour property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, to ;\ncomputer equipment, to ; buildings and improvements, to ; leasehold improvements, to ; and furniture and equipment,\nto . Land is not depreciated.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-\nuse (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities\nin our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nat commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not\nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest\nfor collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options\nto extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n68\nPART II\nItem 8\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their\nestimated period of benefit, ranging from to . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by\ntaking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the\nasset may be impaired.\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for\nincome taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation,\nthe methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities\nfor outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign\nsubsidiaries. The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax\nlaws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill.\nWe adopted the standard effective July 1, 2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock\nmethod. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.\nThe components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\n(In millions, except earnings per share)\nYear Ended

Our objectives for holding\nderivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as\neffectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge\naccounting treatment.\nForeign Currencies\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our\nforeign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange\nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain\nEuro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging\ninstruments.\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in\nforeign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\nInterest Rate\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as\nfair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\n73\nPART II\nItem 8\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their\nmaturities. Wemanage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate\nto certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter\nswap and option contracts.These contractsarenotdesignated as hedging instrumentsand are included in\n“Othercontracts” in the tables below.\nEquity\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold\noptions, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in\n“Other contracts” in the tables below.\nCredit\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit\ndefault swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio\ndiversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in\nthe tables below.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and\noutstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain\nminimum liquidity of $ billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post\ncollateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, our\nlong-term unsecured debt rating was , and cash investments were in excess of $ billion.

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis\nCentre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some\ndating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a\nparty to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes.\nTherefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect\nthe results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996through fiscal year 2016.\nThe decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit\nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting\nfrom producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in\nIreland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in\nfiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from\nproducing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and\nPuerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court\ndecision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to\nearnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and\nservices through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to\nstock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland\nand Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated %, %, and % of our foreign income\nbefore tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021,\nincludes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and\n2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $\nbillion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible\nproperties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign\ncountries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an\nagreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(“TCJA”) regulations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was\nprimarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the\nU.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits\nrelating to stock-based compensation.\n83\nPART II\nItem 8\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30,                                       2022             2021\nDeferred Income Tax Assets\nStock-based compensation expense          $     601       $      502\nAccruals, reserves, and other expenses        2,874            2,960\nLoss and credit carryforwards                 1,546            1,090\nAmortization                                 10,656            6,346\nLeasing liabilities                           4,557            4,060\nUnearned revenue                              2,876            2,659\nOther                                           461              319\nDeferred income tax assets                   23,571           17,936\nLess valuation allowance                     (1,012  )          (769  )\nDeferred income tax assets, net of        $  22,559       $   17,167\nvaluation allowance\nDeferred Income Tax Liabilities\nBook/tax basis differences in             $    (174  )    $   (2,381  )\ninvestments and debt\nLeasing assets                               (4,291  )        (3,834  )\nDepreciation                                 (1,602  )        (1,010  )\nDeferred tax on foreign earnings             (3,104  )        (2,815  )\nOther                                          (103  )          (144  )\nDeferred income tax liabilities           $  (9,274  )    $  (10,184  )\nNet deferred income tax assets            $  13,285       $    6,983\nReported As\nOther long-term assets                    $  13,515       $    7,181\nLong-term deferred income tax                  (230  )          (198  )\nliabilities\nNet deferred income tax assets            $  13,285       $    6,983\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are\npaid or recovered.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ million, $ billion,\nand $ billion, respectively.

We remain under audit for tax years to .\nAs of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have\na material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances\nfor income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key\ntransfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the\ninformation currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies\nfor these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\nsubject to examination for tax years to , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.

In\n2019, the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law.\nProduct-Related Litigation\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a\ndefendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by\nindividual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other\nadverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and\nServices business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and\nare consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision,\nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of\ncellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission\nguidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either\noperated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits\nalso allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general\ncausation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in\npart the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an\ninterlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert\nscientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by\nthe defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The\nplaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In\nAugust 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports.A hearingon\ngeneral causation isscheduled for September of 2022.\nOther Contingencies\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nour business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in\naggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are\nsubject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ million. While we intend to defend these matters\nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ million in aggregate beyond recorded\namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a\nmaterial adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become\nreasonably estimable.\n88\nPART II\nItem 8\nNOTE 16—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShares Outstanding\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,            2022        2021        2020\nBalance, beginning of year    7,519       7,571       7,643\nIssued                           40          49          54\nRepurchased                     (95  )     (101  )     (126  )\nBalance, end of year          7,464       7,519       7,571\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ billion in\nshare repurchases.

During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance\nbased on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal\nComputing.\nOur reportable segments are described below.\nProductivity and Business Processes\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily\ncomprises:\nOffice Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial\nsubscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams,\nOffice 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva.\nOffice Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other\nOffice services.\nLinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\nDynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based\napplications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM\napplications.\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that\ncan power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\nServer products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server,\nVisual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.\nEnterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance\nprofessional services.\nMore Personal Computing\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\nWindows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system;\nWindows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and\nother Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.\nDevices, including Surface and PC accessories.\nGaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content\n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming,\nthird-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.\nSearch and news advertising.\n93\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of\nour business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from\ncertain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and\nservices, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated\ncosts plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology.\nOperating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from\nwhich multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are\nallocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology,\nhuman resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and\nsupport. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being\nallocated.\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,                          2022          2021          2020\nRevenue\nProductivity and Business Processes    $   63,364    $   53,915    $   46,398\nIntelligent Cloud                          75,251        60,080        48,366\nMore Personal Computing                    59,655        54,093        48,251\nTotal                                  $  198,270    $  168,088    $  143,015\nOperating Income\nProductivity and Business Processes    $   29,687    $   24,351    $   18,724\nIntelligent Cloud                          32,721        26,126        18,324\nMore Personal Computing                    20,975        19,439        15,911\nTotal                                  $   83,383    $   69,916    $   52,959\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,          2022          2021          2020\nUnited States (a)      $  100,218    $   83,953    $   73,160\nOther countries            98,052        84,135        69,855\nTotal                  $  198,270    $  168,088    $  143,015\n(a)  Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these\nbusinesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue.\n94\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,                         2022          2021          2020\nServer products and cloud services    $   67,321    $   52,589    $   41,379\nOffice products and cloud services        44,862        39,872        35,316\nWindows                                   24,761        22,488        21,510\nGaming                                    16,230        15,370        11,575\nLinkedIn                                  13,816        10,289         8,077\nSearch and news advertising               11,591         9,267         8,524\nEnterprise Services                        7,407         6,943         6,409\nDevices                                    6,991         6,791         6,457\nOther                                      5,291         4,479         3,768\nTotal                                 $  198,270    $  168,088    $  143,015\nWe have recast certain previously reported amounts in the table above to conform to the way we internally manage\nand monitor our business.\nOur Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365\nCommercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $ billion,\n$ billion and $ billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n96\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The\nCompany offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including\ncloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.\nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements,\nand includes the following:\nDetermination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should\nbe accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold\nwith cloud-based services.\nThe pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance\nobligation.\nIdentification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized\n(e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).\nDetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's\njudgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree\nof auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included\nthe following:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations,\nthe determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.\nWe evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for\nreasonableness.\nWe selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:\n-  Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other\ndocuments that were part of the agreement.\n-  Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.\nAssessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application\n-  of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition\nconclusions.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and\nservices that are not sold separately.\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of\nrevenue recognized in the financial statements.\n97\nPART II\nItem 8\nIncome Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues\nthat remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject\nto IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits,\nresolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management\njudgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and\nprior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that\nremain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax\npositions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax\nspecialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved\ntransfer pricing issues included the following:\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the\nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing\nthe effectiveness of the related internal controls.\nWe read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information\nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\nWe tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax\npositions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\nFor those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had\nappropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or\ndisclosure of the uncertain tax positions.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes,\nregulations and case law, impacted management's judgments.\n/s/\nJuly 28, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n98\nPART II\nItem 9, 9A",

Based on that evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are\neffective.\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\nfor the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records\nthat in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing\nreasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management\nauthorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company\nassets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on\na timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to\nprovide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or\ndetected.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on\nthe framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022. There were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company\nand our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 28, 2022\n100\nPART II, III\nItem 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14",
