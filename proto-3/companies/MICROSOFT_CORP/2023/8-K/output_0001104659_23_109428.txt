  Item 8.01  Other Events.  
                            
Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations

On
October 16, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) announced that, in connection with the previously announced
merger
of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft (the
“Merger”),
with Activision Blizzard surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft, Microsoft has commenced
offers to exchange (each,
an “Exchange Offer” and, collectively, the “Exchange Offers”) any and all outstanding notes issued by Activision
Blizzard (the “Existing Activision Blizzard Notes”) for (1) up to $3,650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of new
notes
to be issued by Microsoft (the “New Microsoft Notes”) and (2) cash. Concurrently with the Exchange Offers being
made
by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard is, upon Microsoft’s request, soliciting consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation”
and, collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”) to adopt certain proposed amendments to each of the corresponding
indentures
governing the Existing Activision Blizzard Notes to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and
events of default from
such indentures.

Each
Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is conditioned upon the completion of the other Exchange Offers and Consent
Solicitations, although
Microsoft may waive such condition at any time with respect to an Exchange Offer.

The
New Microsoft Notes have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the
Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state or foreign securities laws. Therefore, the New
Microsoft Notes
may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. person absent registration, except pursuant to an
applicable exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The
Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the offering
memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated as of October 16, 2023 (as it may be amended or supplemented,
the “Offering
Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement”). A copy of the press release announcing the Exchange Offers and the
Consent Solicitations
is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The
information in this Item 8.01, as well as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished, not filed. Accordingly,
such information
will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by Microsoft under the Securities Act,
unless specifically
identified as being incorporated by reference therein.
