This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and
uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts in this Quarterly Report, including
statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and
objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking
statements may be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potentially,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “target,” or the
negative of these terms or other similar expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not encompass all of
the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report.

Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently
available. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions, including risks described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report,
regarding, among other things:

• our financial performance, including our revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and profitability;

• the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, recessionary fears, recent bank failures, the
COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical conflicts on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which
we and our advertisers, content providers, licensed Roku TV partners, other device licensees, manufacturers,
suppliers, retailers, and users operate;

• our ability to attract and retain users and increase streaming hours;

• our ability to attract and retain advertisers;

• our ability to attract and retain TV brands, manufacturing partners, and service operators to license and deploy
our technology;

• our ability to produce or acquire rights to distribute popular content on our platform on favorable terms, or at
all, including the renewals of our existing agreements with content publishers;

• changes in consumer viewing habits and the growth of TV streaming;

• the growth of our relevant markets, including the growth in advertising spend on TV streaming platforms, and our
ability to successfully grow our business in those markets;

• our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and technological developments;

• our ability to develop and launch new products and provide ancillary services and support;

• our ability to integrate acquired businesses, products, and technologies;

• our ability to expand our products and services into adjacent markets such as the smart home market, scale our
operations in these markets, and do so profitably over time;

• our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants;

• our ability to successfully manage domestic and international expansion;

• our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;

• our ability to address potential and actual security breaches and system failures involving our products, systems
and operations;

• our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property;
• our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, including our ability to enter into new credit agreements;
and
• our ability to comply with laws and regulations that currently apply or may become applicable to our business
both in the United States and internationally, including compliance with privacy and data protection regulations in
various U.S. and international jurisdictions.

Other sections of this Quarterly Report may include additional factors that could harm our business and financial
performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the
impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause
actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the
events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe
that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report or to conform
these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You should read this Quarterly Report, and
the documents referenced in and filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report, with the understanding that our actual
future results, levels of activity, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what we expect.
We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

Organization and Description of Business

Delaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates
in tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including media and
entertainment promotional spending, the demand-side platform, and related services) and content distribution
services (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of
branded channel buttons on remote controls). The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming
players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from
licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners.
                                                                                                                   
  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023 (the “Annual Report”).
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements as of that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes included in the
Company’s Annual Report. The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein.
The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results to be expected for the full year or any future periods.
Certain prior period amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, net revenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:
• revenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable
consideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue
recognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;
• the impairment of intangible assets;
• amortization of content assets;
• valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;
• valuation of Strategic Investments;
• useful lives of tangible and intangible assets;
• allowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and
• the valuation of deferred income tax assets.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.

Principles of Consolidation
The condensed consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company’s restricted cash balance is used to
secure the outstanding letters of credit after the Credit Facility (defined in Note 10) matured and was repaid in
February 2023.
The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash balances with financial institutions which
often exceed regulated insured limits. The table below reflects the percentage of cash, cash equivalent and
restricted cash balances at financial institutions that individually held greater than 10% of the Company’s total
cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash balance at each period reported.

Accounts Receivable, net
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at
invoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other
miscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances
for potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional
activities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales
incentives.

Accounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, and
doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created
when invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable
when the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are
included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 3.4million during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 due to the timing of billing to customers as well as an overall decrease in the
transaction prices in content arrangements.

Deferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations and revenue
recognition. Deferred revenue increased $ 6.7million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to
the timing of certain fulfillment of performance obligations related to contracts with licensing arrangements with
service operators as well as subscription arrangements.

Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023, from amounts included in total deferred revenue as
of December 31, 2022, was $ 55.5million. Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2022, from
amounts included in total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021, was $ 22.4million.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet
been recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in
future periods. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 871.4million as of
March 31, 2023 of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 64% over the next 12months and the remainder
thereafter.

The Company recognized revenue of $ 19.5million and $ 11.2million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, and
March 31, 2022, respectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to changes
in the estimated transaction price of its revenue contracts.

In June 2022, the Company agreed to provide financing of up to $ 60.0million in the aggregate to a counterparty
with whom the Company has a commercial relationship. The Company advanced $ 40.0million in June 2022, in the form
of convertible promissory notes (the “Strategic Investment”) and recognized it as Other non-current assets on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company advanced another $ 5.0million in March 2023, in the form of
convertible promissory notes. The Strategic Investment accrues interest at 5% per annum. The convertible promissory
notes of $ 40.0million have a maturity date of June 15, 2025, and $ 5.0million have a maturity date of March 23,
2026, or are due upon a redemption event or in the event of a default.

The Strategic Investment contains certain redemption features that meet the definition of embedded derivatives and
require bifurcation. The Company elected to apply the fair value option and account for the hybrid instrument
containing the host contract and the embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument, with any subsequent
changes in fair value included in Other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations. See Note 8 for additional details on the fair value of the Strategic Investment.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal market (or most advantageous market, in the absence of a principal market) for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Further, the Company maximizes the use
of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-
level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used
to measure fair value are as follows:
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Financial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $
868.0million and $ 608.4million as cash equivalents as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, using
Level 1 inputs.

Table of Contents
Level 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.

The Company did not have Level 2 instruments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Level 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value
of the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company measured the Strategic Investment using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the
Strategic Investment on the date of purchase was determined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company
recorded an unrealized gain of $ 3.2million in Other income (expense), net related to the adjustment to fair value
of the Strategic Investment for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The Company classified the Strategic Investment as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over
fair value inputs. The fair value of the Strategic Investment was estimated using a scenario-based probability
weighted discounted cash flow model. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and
probability weighting of the various redemption scenarios that impact the settlement of the Strategic Investment.

Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis

Non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use
assets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when
impairment is recognized. The Company recognized an impairment of $ 4.3million primarily related to operating lease
right-of-use assets as part of its restructuring charges during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The Company's operating leases are primarily for office facilities. The leases have remaining terms ranging from
oneto eleven yearsand may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The depreciable life of right-of-use
assets is limited by the expected lease term.

Equity Incentive Plans

The Company has twoequity incentive plans, the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”) and the 2017 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan became effective in September 2017 in connection with the Company’s
initial public offering (“IPO”). No additional equity grants have been made pursuant to the 2008 Plan subsequent to
the IPO. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company’s employees and for the
grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit
awards, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of equity compensation to the Company’s
employees, directors and consultants.

Restricted stock units granted under the 2017 Plan are subject to continuous service. Stock options granted under
the 2017 Plan generally are granted at a price per share equivalent to the fair market value on the date of grant.
Recipients of option grants who possess more than 10% of the combined voting power of the Company are subject to
certain limitations, and incentive stock options granted to such recipients are at a price per share no less than
110% of the fair market value on the date of grant.

unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5years.

Stock-Based Compensation

fair value of the award. Stock options granted to employees generally vest over oneto four yearsand have a term of
ten years. Restricted stock units generally vest over oneto four years. Nostock-based compensation was capitalized
for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of stock-based
compensation capitalized as part of internal-use software was notmaterial.

Manufacturing Purchase Commitments

The Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.
In order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and
suppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-
cancelable. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 122.4million of non-cancelable purchase commitments for
inventory.

Content Commitments

The Company enters into contracts with content publishers to license and produce content for streaming. When a
title becomes available, the Company records a content asset and liability on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. Certain licensing agreements, such as film output deals, include the obligation to license rights for
unknown future titles for which the ultimate quantity and/or fees are not determinable as of the reporting date.
The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. The
unknown obligations could be material. The Company also licenses content under arrangements where the payments are
variable and based on the revenue earned by the Company. Since those amounts cannot be determined, they are not
included in the obligations below.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company's total obligation for content was $ 350.4million, of which the Company recorded
$ 79.8million in Current liabilities and $ 33.8million in Other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. The remaining $ 236.8million is not yet recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as
the content does not meet the criteria for asset recognition.
The expected timing of payments for these content obligations are as follows (in thousands):

Letters of Credit

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount
of $ 37.4million and $ 37.7million, respectively related to operating leases. The letters of credit have various
expiration dates through 2030.

Contingencies

The Company accrues for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing claims, when
it believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly
and
                                                        18                                                         
Table of Contents
adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and
other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal proceedings can be, however,
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course
of business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. The
Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, and
investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final outcome of any
matters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, or results of operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company
did not have any loss contingencies that were material.

Indemnification

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide
indemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to
certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and
out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these
agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against
third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain
liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.
To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any
liabilities related to such obligations in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
                                                                                                                   
  13. INCOME TAXES                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Income tax expense was $ 3.6million and $ 2.2million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to income
taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business and income taxes in the United States.

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized through future operations. As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective
evidence, both positive and negative, as of March 31, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that
some deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation
allowance against its U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted in the United States. The IRA
introduces a 15% alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations,
effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA also includes a 1% excise tax on the net fair
market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The Company considered the applicable tax law
changes, and there is no impact to the Company’s tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The
Company will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future periods.
                                                                                                                   
  14. NET LOSS PER SHARE                                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
The Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to calculate net loss per
share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and as otherwise expressly provided
in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by applicable law, shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share
ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are
the same for both classes.

For purposes of the calculation of diluted net loss per share, options to purchase common stock and restricted
stock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the
treasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in the
period of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.

The Company is organized into tworeportable segments as follows:

Platform

The platform segment generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment
promotional spending, the demand-side platform, and related services) and content distribution services (including
subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel
buttons on remote controls).

Devices

The devices segment generates revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products,
audio products, and related accessories that are sold through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to
customers through the Company’s website. In addition, revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators
and licensed Roku TV partners is included in the devices segment.

In November 2022, the Company approved a plan to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic
conditions. The Company eliminated employee positions in the United States and internationally, and also abandoned
future development for certain technology assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded employee termination expenses
consisting primarily of severance payments, notice pay (where applicable), employee benefits contributions, payroll
taxes and related costs, and an impairment charge related to the abandoned technology assets during the year ended
December 31, 2022.

The Company continued to explore additional measures to curtail its operating expenses during the first quarter of
this fiscal year. As a result, in March 2023, the Company approved the elimination of additional employee positions
in the United States and internationally, and committed to exit and sublease, or cease use, of certain office
facilities that the Company did not currently occupy. The Company recorded employee termination expenses, exits
costs and assets impairment charges related to the exit and abandonment of leased office facilities.
The restructuring charges are recorded as follows (in thousands):

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report for the year
ended December 31, 2022, filed on February 16, 2023, with the SEC.
                                                                                                                   
   Overview                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
Our two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from
the sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment promotional spending, the demand-side platform,
and related services) and content distribution services (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the
sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls).

Devices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs (beginning in 2023), smart home
products, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service
operators and licensed Roku TV partners. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices (“ASP”) of Roku
streaming devices to increase our active accounts. We expect that the trade off from devices gross profit or loss
to grow active accounts will result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit.
                                                                                                                   
   Business Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Macroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, recent bank failures,
financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in economic policy, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain
constraints, and geopolitical developments (such as the war in Ukraine), have had, and we believe will continue to
have, an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, some of our licensed Roku TV
partners faced inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales. In addition, some of our advertising
verticals experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product availability, which, together
with inflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers in a variety of industries reducing
their overall advertising spend, which has adversely affected our platform revenue. We believe rising inflation and
recessionary fears also have led to a reduction in consumer discretionary spending, which has negatively impacted
the demand for our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, although to a
lesser extent than in the past. The ongoing effects of macroeconomic conditions remain difficult to predict due to
numerous uncertainties. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business conditions and
macroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding
Forward Looking Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional details.
                                                                                                                   
  Key Performance Metrics

  Gross Profit                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
We use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue
segments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our
active accounts as they stream content on our platform. Substantially all of our gross profit is generated from our
platform segment.

Our gross profit was $337.6 million and $364.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, reflecting a decrease of 7%.
                                                                                                                   
  Active Accounts                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
We believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define
active accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last
30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included
in this metric. Additionally, users who only register an account for use of our smart home products are not
included in our reported number of active accounts. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the
number of unique individuals who actively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an
account. For example, a single account may be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account
may be used on multiple streaming devices.

We had 71.6 million and 61.3 million active accounts as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting an
increase of 17%.
                                                                                                                   
  Streaming Hours                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
We believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the
growth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the
growing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices
stream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku platforms are
not included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our streaming hours. We report
streaming hours on a calendar basis.

Additionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our
platform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including
advertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue
from content publishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming
hours does not correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis.
Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a streaming device is streaming content, whether a
viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off
the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel
may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also
occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.

Since the first quarter of 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to
identify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user
interaction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm
that they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond
affirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our
customers, channel partners, and advertisers. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have
implemented similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature supplements these channel features. This
feature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.

We streamed 25.1 billion and 20.9 billion hours during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, reflecting an increase of 20%.
                                                                                                                   
  Average Revenue per User                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
We measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our
business. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the
number of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior
year. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform
business.

ARPU was $40.67 as of March 31, 2023 as compared to $42.60 as of March 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease of 5%.

We generate platform revenue from sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment promotional
spending, the demand-side platform, and related services) and content distribution services (including subscription
and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on
remote controls). Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku Channel, native
display ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well as ad inventory we obtain through our content distribution
agreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-sell video ad inventory that we purchase from content
publishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party ad inventory on a revenue share basis. To date, we
have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.

We generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products, audio
products, and related accessories through consumer retail distribution channels and online retailers. Our devices
revenue also includes revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners. We
generate most of our devices revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily sell our
devices through wholesale distributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on
cash and cash equivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of
services as part of a strategic commercial arrangement, foreign currency re-measurement, and transaction gains and
losses, and interest expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization of deferred debt costs. For the
three months ended March 31, 2023, other income (expense), net also includes the change in the fair value of the
Strategic Investment.

Our income tax expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct
business and income taxes in the United States. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,
including net operating losses primarily for the U.S. and any jurisdiction where we do not expect to realize their

Platform

Platform revenue decreased by $9.1 million, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2022. The change was due to lower revenue from advertising as a result of increased
pressure from the macroeconomic factors that strained spending in certain advertisement categories, including media
and

promotional spending, offset by revenue from content distribution services, such as content subscriptions and
Premium Subscriptions through The Roku Channel.

Devices

Devices revenue increased by $16.4 million, or 18%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2022. $10.0 million of the increase is due to a change in estimated transaction price
for a licensing arrangement with a service operator for which performance obligations were satisfied in prior
periods. The remaining increase is due to higher revenue from Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and accessories
offset by lower revenue from sales of streaming players and audio products. The volume of streaming players sold
decreased by 15% and the average selling price of players decreased by 1% in the three months ended March 31, 2023
as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Platform

The cost of revenue, platform increased by $34.8 million, or 13%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This increase is from continued investment in acquiring content
which includes costs such as content amortization, Premium Subscription costs, content publisher revenue share and
credit card processing fees, and a minor increase in cost of acquiring advertising inventory all totaling to $32.8
million.

Gross profit for the platform segment decreased by $43.9 million, or 12%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023
as compared to three months ended March 31, 2022 mainly due to a lower platform revenue that has faced pressures in
the advertising market from overall macroeconomic conditions.

Devices

The cost of revenue, devices remained relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2022. As the pressures on component costs and supply chain eased in the last
quarter of fiscal 2022, active management of the manufacturing costs, freight and management of inventory levels
while introducing new products, resulted in the overall costs of revenue remaining at almost the same level.

Gross profit for the devices segment increased by $16.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the change in estimated
transaction price from a licensing arrangement with a service operator noted above, along with improved revenue
from introduction of new products combined with relatively flat cost of revenue from easing of pressures related to
component costs and supply chain, and active management of the cost components.

Total other income (expense), net, increased $23.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of
$19.8 million from higher interest rates on our cash balances during the period and an unrealized gain of $3.2
million from the change in fair value of the Strategic Investment. The changes in interest expense and foreign
exchange were not significant during the period.

Income tax expense increased by $1.4 million, or 64% during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and was primarily driven by increased income in foreign jurisdictions.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted in the United States. The IRA
introduces a 15% alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations,
effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA also includes a 1% excise tax on the net fair
market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We considered the applicable tax law changes, and
there is no impact to our tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We will continue to evaluate the
impact of these tax law changes on future periods.
                                                                                                                   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,630.1 million. Less than 2% of our cash was held
outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign operations.
In February 2023, we fully repaid the outstanding balance and satisfied all debt obligations under the Credit
Facility (see Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report
for additional information).

On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and
Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. We had approximately
$487.0 million in accounts at SVB on that date. On March 13, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had transferred all
insured and uninsured deposits and substantially all assets of SVB to a newly created, full-service FDIC-operated
“bridge bank” called Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., where depositors would have full access to their money
immediately. We currently have full control of our cash and cash equivalents balance.

Our primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue and proceeds from equity sales,
including equity issued pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of
revenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party
manufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting
and professional service fees, and facility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of
property and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.

We expect to continue to incur expenses for facility and building related costs for our office locations in the
United States and internationally. In addition, we expect to continue our investments in purchases of computer
systems and other property and equipment. We have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, and we may
pursue additional merger and acquisition activities in the future, including the acquisition of rights to
programming and content assets. These activities can materially impact our liquidity and capital resources.

We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital
expenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and
beyond. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be
affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part II, Item 1A,
Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and the effects of the current macroeconomic environment. While the current
macroeconomic environment has not severely impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has contributed
to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our
liquidity and capital resources in the future.

We may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we
raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and
also to restrictive covenants. Additionally, due to the current macroeconomic environment, we may be unable to
obtain debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Our operating activities used cash of $153.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our net loss of
$193.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $181.2 million
comprised mainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, impairment of assets
as part of restructuring charges, and change in fair value of Strategic Investment. The changes in our operating
assets and liabilities used cash of $141.0 million mainly from payments made for accrued liabilities related
payable to content partners, marketing, retail and merchandising costs, payroll and related expenses, payments to
accounts payable and cost of acquiring content, offset by higher collections of accounts receivable and an increase
in deferred revenue.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included cash outflows of $59.2 million
consisting of purchases of property and equipment and expenditures related to expansion of our office facilities of
$54.2 million and the purchase of a Strategic Investment of $5.0 million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our financing activities used cash of $79.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cash outflow
related primarily to the repayment of $80.0 million of our Credit Facility that became due in February 2023 offset
by $0.9 million received from proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.

Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations

Our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of March 31, 2023 consisted of:

• Commitments to purchase finished goods from our contract manufacturers and other inventory related items.
Consistent with industry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with
our contract manufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and
open orders based on projected demand information. Our contract manufacturers source components and build our
products based on these demand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our
products may result in us being committed to purchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments. For additional
information regarding manufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

• Commitments to license content from content publishers and produce content under contractual arrangements. For
additional information regarding content commitments, see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

• Operating lease liabilities that are included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and liabilities
related to the lease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease
liabilities, see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly
Report.

The contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally
binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions
are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable at the time
our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to
the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report.

  Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents. The
primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly
increasing risk. We believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would impact our
interest income by an additional $16.7 million.
                                                                                                                   
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Most of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related
to our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances, and lease
liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of
current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains
or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or
other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the
future.

evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a
reasonable assurance level.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.
                                                                                                                   
   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting                                                            
                                                                                                                   
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Our business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider the risks
and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report, including
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our
business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously
harmed. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks
occurring simultaneously. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being harmed in these risk factors
will include harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future
prospects. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or
all of your investment. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such
risks have not already materialized. The risks facing our business have not changed substantively from those
discussed in our Annual Report, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023, except for those risks marked with an
asterisk (*).

   Risks Related to Our Business and Industry                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The TV streaming industry is highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content
owners and aggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to
differentiate ourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and
retain users and our business will be harmed.

The TV streaming industry is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and
retaining users on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need
to be able to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to
the content they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the
features and functionality of our streaming platform for users, content publishers, and advertisers. We also must
effectively support popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime
Video, Disney+, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in the TV
streaming industry.

Large technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku
streaming devices. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart
TVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into
smart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have greater financial resources than we do and can
subsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements in order to promote their other products
and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, and increase streaming
hours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or
that provide a better streaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands
through advertising than we do.

In addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game
consoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast, offer TV
streaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing consumer
bases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in the TV
streaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to Roku streaming devices, we
may not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours, revenue, gross profit or ARPU.

We also compete for streaming hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may
prefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming
could adversely impact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our
business.

We expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as
well as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing
pressure, lower revenue and gross profit, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our platform or our other
products to gain or maintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading
TV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and
support, and device distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards and unknown future developments
may require further investments in the development of Roku streaming devices, our platform and our other products.
We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive
position. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger
customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which
provide them with advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they
may be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion,
sales, and distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products
better than we can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or
standards and may be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our
sales volume, revenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and
otherwise harm our business.

To enhance our users’ experience, we also offer audio products, including Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers,
and Roku wireless subwoofers, and Roku smart home products, including indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells,
smart lighting, and smart plugs. As a result, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio speakers
and soundbars and other TV peripheral devices, as well as makers of other smart home products. If these products do
not operate as designed or do not enhance the TVs powered by Roku OS or other viewing experiences as we intend, our
users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may impact the overall demand for our products and
our partners’ Roku TV models.

Our future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of over-the-top (“OTT”) advertising and OTT advertising
platforms.*

We operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other
streaming platforms and services, including social media and other digital platforms, as well as traditional media,
such as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content
and other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These
competitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may
adversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from
advertising. For example, Netflix and Disney+ have launched ad-supported tiers in their streaming services, which
may further increase competition for streaming advertising revenue. If we are unable to increase our revenue from
advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to further optimize and
measure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory, and expanding our advertising sales team and
programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be harmed. We may not be able to compete
effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue
and would harm our business.

Many advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,
such as traditional TV, radio, and print, and to advertising through social media and other digital platforms. The
future growth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising and on advertisers increasing their spending
on advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers have shown growing interest in OTT advertising,
we cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to traditional TV
advertising or shift their advertising spending to social media and other digital platforms (rather than to us). In
addition, if we are unable to compete with social media and other digital platforms to win business from
advertisers and agencies who have traditionally advertised on these platforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small
or medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be limited. If advertisers, or their agency
relationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we
expect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.

Finally, there is political pressure in some countries to limit OTT advertising (including limiting the advertising
that may be shown to viewers of children’s content) or impose local content requirements on OTT services, which
could pose a threat to our services.

We may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.*

Our business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We
generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment
promotional spending, the demand-side platform, and related services) and content distribution services (including
subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel
buttons on remote controls). As such, we are seeking to expand the number of active accounts and increase the
number of hours that are streamed across our platform in an effort to create additional platform revenue
opportunities. As our user base grows and as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our
platform, we must effectively monetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of
streaming hours, however, does not correlate with platform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because
we do not monetize every hour streamed or every user on our platform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are
measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For
example, if a player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does
not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel may continue to play content for a period of
time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku
streaming devices and other set-top boxes. Since the first quarter of 2020, all Roku devices include a Roku OS
feature that is designed to identify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended
period of time without user interaction. This feature periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still
watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. Some of our
leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have similar features within their channels.

Our ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to
advertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or
prevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect viewing data or to
provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to collect data
regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our legal
obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data
from many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users.

Other channels available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on
increasing user engagement and time spent within their channels by allowing users to purchase additional content
and streaming services within their channels; when users purchase these additional services within these channels,
we may earn less revenue than when the services are purchased directly from us. If our users spend most of their
time within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user
information, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant
advertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit.
Additionally, our distribution agreements with our most popular channels are renegotiated periodically; thus, even
if we are currently able to monetize streaming hours within a channel, we may not be able to do so in the future.
If we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.

Our efforts to monetize our streaming platform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not
continue to grow as we expect, and our platform revenue growth has been, and may continue to be, lower than
expected due to advertisers significantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to inflationary pressures,
recessionary fears or other reasons that are out of our control. In addition, advertisers’ spending commitments,
such as those we obtain in connection with annual TV Upfront presentations, are typically not fully binding, and
the revenue we receive from such commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. This means that in
order to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we
will need to attract significantly more advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-
supported content that results in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-
supported content.

If we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView ad platform or if we are not
successful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.

Through our OneView ad platform, advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage
their OTT, desktop and mobile advertising campaigns. OneView leverages the demand-side platform developed by
dataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of our
proprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic OTT ad buying is an emerging market, and
our current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not shift to programmatic ad buying from other
buying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for programmatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or
develops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising agencies may not use OneView or we may not attract
prospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and our business could be harmed. In addition, if
OneView does not have the functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be
able to attract their advertising spend to OneView, or our existing customers may not maintain or increase their
spend on OneView. Moreover, our ownership of OneView may negatively impact the ability of OneView to purchase
advertising on non-Roku platforms. If we fail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to our customers’
evolving needs, advertisers and advertising agencies will not adopt OneView, and our business may be harmed. We
also may not be able to compete effectively with more established demand-side platforms or be able to adapt to
changes or trends in programmatic OTT advertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue and
harm our business.

Our growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV
partners and manufacturing partners in the United States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service
operators.*

We have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand and manufacturing
partners. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and
international markets. In the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has
materially contributed to our active account growth, streaming hours, and platform monetization efforts. This
growth has primarily been driven by North America; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to
certain international markets and represents a growing share of new active accounts. We license the Roku OS and our
smart TV reference designs to certain licensed Roku TV partners to manufacture Roku TV models. We do not typically
receive, nor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we expect to incur
expenses in connection with these commercial agreements.
                                                        35                                                         
Table of Contents
The primary economic benefits that we derive from these license arrangements have been and will likely continue to
be indirect, primarily from growing our active accounts, increasing streaming hours, and generating content
distribution and advertising-related revenue on our platform. If these arrangements do not continue to result in
increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth does not in turn lead to successfully monetizing
that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.

While we recently launched a new line of Roku-branded TVs (the Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs) that are
designed, made, and sold by us, the loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner in the near future could
harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other
partners and distribution channels, increase our marketing costs, and result in the loss of revenue. If we are not
successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with any of these third parties, or if we
encounter technological, content licensing, or other impediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or
maintain our business could be adversely impacted.

We have also developed licensing relationships with certain service operators, primarily in international markets;
however, this program has been decreasing in scale in recent years, as we have shifted the focus of our
international growth to the sale of Roku streaming devices and expanding our Roku OS licensing program with
licensed Roku TV partners. Based on the decreasing scale of our licensing program for service operators, including
termination of these relationships, we expect that the number of active accounts generated from this program will
continue to decline, which may impact the overall growth rate of our active accounts in international markets.

Our licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential
partners include TV brands, cable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers. Under these license
arrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources these entities
dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their forecasts and
anticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to meet their forecasts or such
launches in the future. If our licensed Roku TV partners or service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts
or such launches for distributing licensed streaming devices or choose to deploy competing streaming solutions
within their product lines, our business may be harmed.

We depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain
these relationships, our business could be harmed.*

Historically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed
on our platform. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, the top three streaming services represented over 50% of
all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically
streamed a large percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, our active
accounts, or Roku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.

If popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users
and attract new users.

We must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content
publishers to provide popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and content. In order to remain
competitive, we must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and
content, particularly as we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by Roku OS, or enter new
markets, including international markets. If we are not successful in helping our content publishers launch and
maintain streaming channels and streaming channel features that attract and retain a significant number of users on
our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be harmed. Our
ability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel offerings on a cost-effective
basis largely depends on our ability to:

• effectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;

• minimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and

• minimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.

In addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream
certain channels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of
popular streaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand
their audiences on our platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.
                                                        36

The non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content publishers may result in the removal of certain
channels or channel features from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.

We enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including
expiration dates and rights to terminate under certain circumstances. Our agreements with content publishers
generally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the end of the term by the content
publisher under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter
bankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content publishers’ security or other platform certification
requirements.

Upon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing
content from these content publishers on our streaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future
may not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements
have expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, or if a
content publisher terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we may be required to temporarily or
permanently remove certain channels or channel features from our streaming platform.

The loss of such channels or channel features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our
business. More broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to
us, or at all, or if these content publishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may
lose channel partners or users and our business may be harmed.

If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell
our available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.

Our business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to
advertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to
sell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure
content that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient
supply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are
also dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming
platform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may
fail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on
our streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the
publishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform
varies greatly among channels. Accordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video ad
inventory on our platform. For certain channels, including YouTube’s ad-supported channel, we have no access to
video ad inventory at this time, and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services
introduce new ad-supported tiers to their streaming services, we have in the past and in the future may not be able
to reach agreement on access to video ad inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. The
amount, quality, and cost of video ad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow
and maintain a sufficient supply of quality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our
business may be harmed.

If our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business
may be harmed.

As our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be
attractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected
not to participate in our new home screen menu features or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage
within their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language
in order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels on our streaming platform. If we introduce
new features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a change may not comply with certain content
publishers’ certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers may find other languages, such as
HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their channels on other platforms. If
key content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop channels for, do not
value and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine
that our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their certification requirements, our
business may be harmed.

If the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform are not relevant or
not engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.

We have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver
relevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our users. Existing and
prospective advertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and media and entertainment
promotional spending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem
irrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of
our advertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but we may not be
successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and content publishers.
If the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not
relevant, overly intrusive or too frequent and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using our
platform, which will harm our business.

We are subject to various risks in connection with our operation of The Roku Channel.

We operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television
series, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses
in connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily
through advertising. For example, we previously acquired content rights, including rights to certain projects in
development, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and announced that The Roku Channel
would become the home of such content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old House
business, which own and produce the “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related
business lines, to further the growth strategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel. We also
commission original content that we own and distribute on The Roku Channel.

If our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not
have the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract
users to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku
Channel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do
this by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The
agreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make
specific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these
agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new
agreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the
duration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable
terms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku
Channel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers,
usage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.

In addition, following the Quibi and This Old House transactions and the launch of our advertising brand studio, we
are producing content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited experience
producing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing to our
users and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with content
production, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not
relevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available
content, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not
generate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition, we distribute The
Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that we will be
successful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising through the
distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.

If our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,
our business may be harmed.

We earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our
platform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from
various content publishers. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or
subscriptions for any reason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content
publishers or by other means for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.

In addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from
within their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn
from sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their
spending on such in-channel transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business
may be harmed.

We operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that are outside of our control,
which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.

TV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth
and profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming
platform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an
entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access
(including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband content delivery, broadband
service providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content traveling on their networks, the
quality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for users relative to other sources of content, the
quality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms, and other macroeconomic conditions.
Accordingly, our growth and the future evolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact our
success, is dependent on many factors that are outside of our control.

We and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective
products, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners
could experience lower product sales.*

To continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and
for the Roku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV
partners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,
including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon.

We also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers
such as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, and MediaMarkt in Germany. As we have only recently expanded to
certain international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or relationships with retailers for
those markets as compared to our sales channels in the United States or our competitors in international markets.
Amazon and Walmart in total accounted for 49% and 58% of our devices revenue for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

Our retailers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. We have no minimum purchase
commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or distributors. If one or several retailers or
distributors were to discontinue selling our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to
prominently display those devices in their stores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their
brick and mortar locations, the volume of our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could
decrease, which would harm our business. If any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work
exclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to, other operating system developers,
this may adversely impact our ability to continue to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV
brands and our ability to continue to grow active accounts and monetize the Roku OS. Traditional retailers have
limited shelf and end cap space in their stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited
prime website product placement space. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more
extensive product lines, stronger brand identity and greater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google,
possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own
competitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart home devices, is able to market and promote these products more
prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or promote our products on its website. Any reduction in our
ability to place and promote our products, or increased competition for available shelf or website placement, could
require us to increase our marketing or other expenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in
reduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In particular, the availability of product
placement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are
unable to effectively sell our products during these periods, our business would be harmed.

If our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may
not be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.

Building and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number
of TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be
positively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our
products or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of the
Roku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content that our content publishers
provide, may be out of our control, yet users may nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be
able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our
competitors are larger companies and may have greater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through
traditional advertising, digital advertising or website product placement. If we are unable to execute on building
a strong brand, it may be difficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in
the marketplace, therefore our ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may
be harmed.

Our streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of channels, representing a variety of
content from a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and
watch, and they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to Roku streaming devices. While
we have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates
third-party rights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content.
Controversies related to the content included on certain channels that we distribute have resulted in, and could in
the future result in, negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may
harm our business.

We are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their
invoices, our business may be harmed.

Many of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency
is not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential
liability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,
may subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.

This credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In
addition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated
period of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In
addition, we typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising
industry. While we attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies,
we are not always successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter
cycles than our accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of
credit losses.

We may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming
platform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or
through our demand-side platform. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit
losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-
offs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may
increase over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies
on time or at all, our business may be harmed.

The quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we
could lose users, advertisers, content partners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.

Our users depend on our customer support organization to resolve issues relating to our products and our streaming
platform. A high level of support is critical for the success of our business. We currently outsource the majority
of our customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end
users. In addition, we train our licensed Roku TV partners and service operator licensees to provide first-level
customer support to users of Roku TV models. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage our third-party
customer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if that support organization does not succeed
in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability
to monetize our streaming platform, to sell our products to consumers and could harm our reputation with potential
new customers and our licensees.

We must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new
products and services expose our business to new risks.*

We must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet
changing consumer demands. In particular, we recently introduced Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs (a new line
of Roku-branded TVs that are designed, made, and sold by us) and Roku smart home products (including indoor and
outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smart lighting, and smart plugs) and related subscription services. The
introduction of a new product or service is a complex task, involving significant expenditures in research and
development, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to new risks. The introduction
of new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may result in new or enhanced
governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications that could adversely affect
our business, reputation, or financial results. For example, we have faced and may continue to face new
intellectual property infringement claims related to new products and services we have introduced. In addition, our
entrance into entirely new lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV streaming and advertising,
such as our launch of Roku smart home products, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ
from the risks we face as a result of our TV streaming business.

Whether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our
ability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to
our streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective
manner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. The development of
new products and services is a highly complex process, and while our research and development efforts are aimed at
solving increasingly complex problems, we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. The successful
development and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:

• the accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;

• our ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;

• our development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;

• our timely completion of new designs and development;
• our ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;

• our ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;
• the ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;

• the availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;

• tariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments, which could impact the
pricing, timing and availability of new products and depress consumer demand, limit the ability of our contract
manufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies, and lead to shortages;

• the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing
mishaps, and shipping delays; and

• our ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.

If any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or services
in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.

We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract
manufacturers, and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.

We do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to
build our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among
other issues:

• capacity constraints;

• reduced component availability;

• production, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from labor disputes, strikes, mechanical
issues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health crises; and

• the impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,
other products, or data transfers.

As a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when
components are in short supply or when we introduce new products.

We also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely
on them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component
shortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems have impaired, and could in the future
impair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our
contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our
retailers and distributors.

We also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our
products. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete
desired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract
manufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.

Our contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,
manufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract
manufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract
manufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because
of inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they
decide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment
                                                        41

may be delayed or terminated, and we would have to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative
contract manufacturers.

Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy
our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely
basis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could
require us to reduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our
revenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.

In addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,
are located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,
social, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or
disrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the current tensions
between Taiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese
suppliers, our supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international
location of these facilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade
restrictions on exports or imports.

The supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems
with their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.

Some of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or
exclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to
retailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV
partners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in
tariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports: restrictions, by the
United States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or
components for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.

Our licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when
components are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or
suppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku
TV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and
other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.
Interruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV
models at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models
sold at retail, resulting in slower active account and streaming hour growth.

Furthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models
could harm our brand and our business.

If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our
contract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.

We bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,
our contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for
our products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf
through different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,
including the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given
time, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our
products are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many
months in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess
components and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or
build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have
agreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our
decision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess
supply commitments, our business may be harmed.

Conversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material
or component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities
available to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In
addition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship
our products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross
margin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately
forecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.
                                                        42

Our products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to
obtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to
our retailers and distributors.

We depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players
and TVs powered by Roku OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi front-
end module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a second
source.

Although this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering
development and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also
creates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or
material supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other
export or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their
components (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.

There is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired
by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on
allocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control
restrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,
or logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary
pressures, geopolitical conflict, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and
may in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,
and which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source
supplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,
and may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.

Our reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:

• supplier capacity constraints;

• price increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;

• timely delivery;

• component quality; and

• delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.

Any interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to
meet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and
harm our business.

If our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content
publishers and other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.

The Roku OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via
Roku streaming devices offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all
channels and other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, including virtual multi-
channel video programming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings,
technologies, and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not
provide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are
made to those offerings that are not compatible with Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase active
account growth and user engagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will be
harmed.

We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, our recently announced Roku-
branded TVs, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function well with these
offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content publishers have the right to test and
certify our new products before we can publish their channels. The certification processes can be time consuming
and introduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new
products on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain certifications, our product release
plans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products to all licensed Roku TV partners or
we may not continue to offer certain channels. To continue to grow our active accounts and user engagement, we will
need to prioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies, and
systems, including our recently announced smart home products. If we are unable to maintain consistent operability
of Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms, our business could be harmed.
                                                        43

In addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, such as
virtual service operators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of
Roku streaming devices. We may not successfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these
offerings, technologies, or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings,
technologies, or systems, our business could be harmed.

Our products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in
ways that could harm our reputation and our business.

Our products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have contained and may in the future
contain hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any number of ways
in our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, data
loss or poor quality, device malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. Some errors may only be
discovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be detected under certain
circumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance
processes, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such update.

The introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a
limited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product
support, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of
time. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in
revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our
business, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information
liability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with
our end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be
upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely
affect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate
or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.

Components used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown
to us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.

We rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of
our products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our
products that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they
could cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by
which our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network
router. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access
point, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to
recall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable cost and expense. Should we have a
widespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely affected.

If we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to
develop new products or streaming platform enhancements may be impaired.

We utilize or enable certain industry standard and other commercially available technology in our products and
streaming platform that is licensed by third parties. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to
our products and on our streaming platform, we may be required to license additional technologies from third
parties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are
unable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies
with lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of
our products, streaming platform, and our business.
                                                                                                                   
   Risks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business                                                             
                                                                                                                   
We have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior
quarters, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability again in
the near term or at all.

We have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we
achieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near
term or at all. As of March 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $781.6 million. We generally expect our
operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to expand our operations and invest in growth and new
areas, although we expect operating expense year-over-year growth to significantly decline over the course of 2023.
                                                        44

If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may not be able to
achieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of reasons,
including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may encounter
unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may result in
losses in future periods.

Our quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we
fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.

Our revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-
to-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are
outside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:

• the entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;

• our ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and
monetize our streaming platform;

• our ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or
other macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is
currently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;

• our revenue mix, which drives gross profit;

• supply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;

• seasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;

• the timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels, or features;

• the addition or loss of popular content or channels;

• the expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;

• the ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;

• an increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;

• delays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or
distribution chains; and

• an increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party
intellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.

Our gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment (which generates revenue from
the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products, audio products, and related accessories, as
well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV brand partners) has lower
gross margins compared to our platform segment (which generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising
(including media and entertainment promotional spending, the demand-side platform, and related services) and
content distribution services (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium
Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls)). Gross margins on our streaming
players, audio products, and smart home products vary across models and can change over time as a result of product
transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, device returns, and other cost fluctuations.

In addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely
impacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or sales channel mix, component cost increases, price
competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or
reduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin in an
effort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our gross profit. As a result, our devices revenue may
not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless we are able to continue to increase our
platform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be unable to grow gross profit and our business
will be harmed. For example, in the past, global supply chain disruptions
                                                        45

have resulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices,
which negatively affected our devices gross margin. If a reduction in gross margin does not result in an increase
in our active accounts or an increase in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may suffer,
and our business may be harmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past, and may experience
in the future, lower gross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower than we anticipate,
our financial results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.

If we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.*

We have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,
operations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these
activities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant
demands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:

• manage a larger organization;

• hire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;

• expand internationally;

• increase our sales and marketing efforts;

• expand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;

• broaden our customer support capabilities;

• expand our product offerings;

• support our licensed Roku TV partners and service operators;

• expand and improve the content offering on our platform;

• implement appropriate operational and financial systems; and

• maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to
execute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.

We have in the past, and may in the future, undertake restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and
manage our operating expenses. For example, in March 2023, we approved a restructuring plan to lower our year-over-
year operating expense growth rate and prioritize projects that we believe will have a higher return on investment,
which resulted in workforce reduction and the commitment to exit and sublease, or cease use, of certain office
facilities that we did not occupy. We have incurred and expect to incur material costs and charges in connection
with these plans and initiatives, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these plans and
initiatives. Our restructuring plans may adversely affect our internal programs and our ability to recruit and
retain skilled and motivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, or
inefficiency during transitional periods, may require a significant amount of employees’ time and focus, and may be
distracting to employees, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. For more information,
see Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or are unable to manage our
growth and expansion plans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if
implemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.*

We currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,
selling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United
States. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While
we intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see
compelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and
streaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because
some of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and
have greater experience managing a global organization.

In the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely
affect our business, including:
                                                        46

• differing legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and
regulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade
(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content
restrictions, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, and local content and advertising
requirements, among others;

• exposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK
Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws
prohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records
and a system of sufficient internal controls;

• slower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;

• different or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that
consumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by
incumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;

• greater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including
delivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;

• our ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain
international markets;

• availability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;

• challenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;

• differing legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;

• unstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, whatever the cause, including
due to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of
Ukraine), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions (such as the tension
between China and Taiwan), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;

• adverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the
imposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion
rules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of
companies that have cross-border business activities;

• the imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World
Trade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;

• any pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the
use of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such
services to existing or new customers in international markets;

• inflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for
materials, supplies, and services;

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international
operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange
Rate Risk” in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report for additional information);

• restrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and

• working capital constraints.

In addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our business model in international markets. Three
core areas of focus define our business model: first, we grow scale by increasing our active accounts; second, we
grow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform; and, third, we grow monetization
of the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Even if we are able to increase our active
accounts in international markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our streaming hours or monetize user
activity in those markets. Further, our ARPU may be lower in international markets than in the United States. If we
invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully
and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.

Our revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our
expectations, our business may be harmed.*

Seasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit
are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total
net revenue for
                                                        47

such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons. Furthermore, in
preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the average selling prices
of our products through retailers in an effort to grow our active accounts, which typically reduce our devices
gross margin in the fourth quarter.

Given the seasonal nature of advertising and our product sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.
We anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in
expected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our
competitors, reductions in consumer discretionary spending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our
supply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or air freight delays, or for any
other reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, recent
macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures negatively affected consumer electronics sales during the
holiday season in 2022. In addition, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the past, and may in the
future, adversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver products to retailers
during holiday seasons.

A substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and
benefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue
shortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in
the short term, and our business would be harmed.

If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our
employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.*

Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team
and in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In
particular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall
management, as well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our
strategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key
personnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable
successor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject
to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled
workers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our
employees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources
to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. Because we face
significant competition to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer,
competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, many
companies now offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for employees from
employers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and may in the
future need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition and other
business and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees
necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of
replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.

We believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we
continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,
past or any additional workforce reductions could harm employee morale and negatively impact employee recruiting
and retention. In addition, the equity ownership of many of our employees could create disparities in wealth among
our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees and our business.

We need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex
business arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so
could adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.

We have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international
jurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into
new markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our
operational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant
additional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,
and other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly
complex.

To manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and
financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on
manual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment
services. Our current
                                                        48

and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules
governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems
associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely
affect our relationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement agencies, licensed Roku TV
partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in errors in our financial and
other reporting.

We may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these
risks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.

We have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and
capabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of
potential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any
acquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits
from an acquisition may never materialize.

Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could
adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and
disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial
returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions.

In addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen
operating difficulties and expenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies
involve areas of operation in which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products,
or technologies in international markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of
operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and
regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at
all, without incurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address
such risks successfully, our business could be harmed.

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this
capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.*

We intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional
funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming
platform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our
retail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,
personnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses
and capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will
depend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming
platform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the
hiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic
conditions.

We may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through
future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant
dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those
of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants
relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential
acquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and
an acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.

We previously entered into a credit agreement, dated February 19, 2019 (as amended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit
Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provided for a four-year revolving credit facility in
the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, a four-year delayed draw term loan A facility in the
aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, and an uncommitted incremental facility subject to certain
conditions. In February 2023, our Credit Agreement matured and we repaid the entire debt balance in full and
satisfied all outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Agreement. While we may enter into a new credit
agreement in the future, we currently have no other committed sources of financing, and we may not be able to
obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Any future credit agreements we may enter into
could require a lien on our assets or contain financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may
limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. If we are unable to obtain
adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support
our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be
harmed.

We maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial
institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.*

We maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the
FDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not
insured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited
liquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns
or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank
failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the
financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact
our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other
comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or
financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks,
government institutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy

Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,
cause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.

We are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary
course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,
and other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card
information, user video and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential
information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry
standards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of personal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security
safeguards as part of an information security program, and limits on the use or cross-border transfer of such
personal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our business partners, our
users, and other relevant stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential
users.

We have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology
infrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,
transmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and user video
and audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or
could have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential
information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their
responsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of
third parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex.

While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security
breaches, incidents, attacks, and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our
information technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems,
make such systems vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal, and external threats on our technology
environment. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party
vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties.

For example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those
systems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have experienced,
and remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and improper employee
access of confidential data. Malicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence,
sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a
wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized
criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting
geopolitical conflict also have increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations
globally, including for companies headquartered in the United States.

Most of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).
Although we have implemented work from home protocols and offer work-issued devices to employees, the actions of
our employees while working from home may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we
process, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from
employees’ combined use of personal and private devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that
we do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.
                                                        50

In addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or
intellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-
service attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the
nature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our
systems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,
content publishers’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our
data (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or
intellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or
services in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to
protect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the
threat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our
cybersecurity.

Recent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks,
with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and
methodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may impact our
ability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors experience an
outage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally, our third-party
vendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such third parties
for use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be
affected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open source software, which may be incorporated into our
systems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which we are not
aware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. For example, the Apache Log4j vulnerability discovered in
December 2021 can be exploited by remote code execution, which can allow a bad actor to steal data or take over our
systems. We have taken steps to patch this vulnerability by updating our relevant Apache software, but we, and the
many other affected organizations, remain vulnerable in light of the widespread use of the Apache Log4j library and
difficulty in identifying all instances of this library across an entire enterprise. We cannot assure you that we
will not be impacted by this or other similar vulnerabilities in the future.

We maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,
there may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that security incidents may not be covered by our insurance
policies, and not all aspects of a security incident may be covered even where coverage exists. Insurance policies
will also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security incident. Even where an incident is
covered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we
may be faced with in the wake of a security incident.

The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or
results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or
co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our
existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms
or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm
may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,
security, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,
regulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and
attract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly
attractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our platform, streaming devices,
smart home products, website, computer systems, or mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us
to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our reputation. Efforts
to prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in our products are
expensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or vulnerabilities.

Such unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk
of contractual damages, litigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of
harm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings
and as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial
resources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.

Significant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other
similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,
misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or
personal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,
whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,
foreign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our
product development and our business operations.
                                                        51

There is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not
been discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have
not discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to
systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that
leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal
information regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with
applicable federal or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming,
distracting, and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require
us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations,
and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This
could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm.

For example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties
and related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment
Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.
Penalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities
within the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such
enforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party
payment processors.

In addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our
privacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further
security incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer
of sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,
enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,
and could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or
potential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims
by third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially
and adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our
contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,
data security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying
them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended
to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary
information that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent
service interruptions or further security incidents.

Data protection laws around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and
organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and
evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or
reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in
accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain. In addition
to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a data security incident, which could
adversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs and reputational harm.

We and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential
information, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.*

We collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),
other consumers, employees, job applicants and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect,
process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information (including our users’ payment card data and video
and audio recordings). We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad
and may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service
providers and our business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related
technologies, to help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and
partners’ content and deliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our
partners on our products.

We collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and
content publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully
leverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be
restricted by a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our
service providers’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by
advertisers, content publishers, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws,
regulations, and industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit
access to or storage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for
advertising) that is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested
                                                        52                                                         
Table of Contents
service or used for the “sole purpose” of a transmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose
not to provide this consent to collection of information which is used for advertising purposes.

Additionally, certain device manufacturers or operating system providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and
similar technologies, or otherwise restrict the collection of personal information through these or other tools,
via our applications. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our
revenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising
campaigns.

Various federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations
govern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and
security of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory
environment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,
content distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally.

Privacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”),
state attorneys general, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian
national data protection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that
identify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the
internet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and
foreign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict
industry participants’ ability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of
consumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For
example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the
collection, storage, and use of personal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in
the context of EU operations) and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations, and may
require us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done.
In addition, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted
a framework similar to the GDPR. The EU has recently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being
“adequate” to receive EU personal data. We are monitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data
protection framework and the impact this may have on our business.

We will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not
compliant with data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines
and penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For
example, under the GDPR, fines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data
processing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements.

Data protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For
example, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) came into effect in August 2020. The LGPD bears many
substantive similarities to the GDPR such as extra-territorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data
transfer restrictions, and mandatory breach notification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a
company’s annual revenue in Brazil.

The U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based
data privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider
additional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and
may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an
effort to comply.

For example, effective October 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”)
to require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to intake requests
from consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Effective January 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information, such as
rights to access, and require deletion of, their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal
information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides
for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data
breach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023 (with a
“look-back” to January 1, 2022), builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment of a
dedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy issues. In recent years, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah
have adopted laws introducing new privacy obligations for which we may need to take additional steps to comply.

Furthermore, several national and local governments have proposed or enacted measures related to the use of
artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning in products and services. For example, in Europe, there is a
proposed regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose new and substantial obligations related to the use
of AI-related systems. In the U.S., there similarly is growing interest among policymakers with respect to
potential legislation, regulation
                                                        53                                                         
Table of Contents
and/or guidance to address perceived concerns with the rapid uptake of AI technologies. The rules and regulations
adopted by policymakers over time may require us to make changes to our business practices.

We are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments
to existing laws on our business. Among other things, such restrictions are likely to increase the number of users
to whom we cannot serve targeted advertising, and are likely to restrict our ability to collect and process certain
types of information deemed sensitive under these new laws. The Canadian province of Quebec has also recently
enacted a data protection law, known as Bill 64, that may similarly restrict our data processing activities.

In addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as
many other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or
others within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to
or acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.
Additionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a
security breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause
our users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend
significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived
security breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may
cause reputational harm.

As part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the
transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United
States. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United
States, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to
the United States. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be an
invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues
regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On March 25, 2022, the European
Commission and U.S. government announced that an agreement in principle on a new framework for data transfers from
the EEA to the United States had been reached, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), and
that this new framework should address the concerns raised in the 2020 European Court of Justice decision. On
December 13, 2022, the European Commission released its draft adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. DPF, which, once
formally adopted, would recognize that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data
transferred from the EU to organizations certified under the EU-U.S. DPF. Additional steps will need to be taken to
formally adopt and implement this framework, however, and we are not yet able to predict precisely when or the
degree to which it will provide a consistent mechanism for our data transfers between the two jurisdictions. In
addition, in 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be
incorporated into new and existing agreements by no later than December 27, 2022 in order to continue to lawfully
transfer personal information outside of the EEA. The United Kingdom published final versions of its own Model
Clauses in February 2022. Updating agreements to incorporate these new Model Clauses for the EEA and United Kingdom
has required, may in the future require, significant time and resources to implement, including through adjusting
our operations, conducting requisite data transfer assessments, and revising our contracts. In addition, cloud
service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny from EU regulators, which may
lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal information outside the EU,
which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate.

We continue to assess the available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data
Protection Authorities and the U.S. Department of Commerce on international data transfer compliance for companies,
including guidance on specific supplementary measures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data
sharing that may be deemed a cross-border transfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our
ability to continue to transfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may
subject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience
operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.

We will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our
personal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform
to applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to
predict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also
have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter
requirements for certain data processing activities.

In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data
regarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.
Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect
that, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and
enforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CPRA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will
lead to increased operational and compliance
                                                        54

costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary, make changes to our operations, policies,
and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-related legal obligations, or any
compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, contractual
indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others. In addition to potential
liability, these events could harm our business.

We publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and
disclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we
endeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or
may be perceived to have failed to do so.

Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, representatives,
agents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and
documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state, and federal action if they
are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols
imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data
collection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing
laws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase
our cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.

Any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could
result in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.

We rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service
providers and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku OS, streaming platform, smart home products,
and computer systems. For example, our smart home product line is reliant on (among other things) the engineering
and software development teams and information technology systems of the service providers we use to assist in the
design, manufacture, and maintenance of those products. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the
unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products
and streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer
systems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-
based or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we
exercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that
they may experience. In the future, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting
systems to cloud computing services, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we
are unable to manage such a transition effectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services,
operational delays, or inefficiencies until the transition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any
of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on
terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor
to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In
addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications
failures, break-ins, and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely.

As we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our
operations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could
adversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully
cover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these
vendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.

If any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to
downtime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and
may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of
factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to
continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform
performance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity
constraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to
accommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated
changes in technology, our business may be harmed.

Changes in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.

Our business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As
a result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the
internet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to
upgrade and maintain
                                                        55

their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their continued willingness to
preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over network operators, which
makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as any decision they may
make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic. Any material disruption
or degradation in internet services could harm our business.

To the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect
the reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand
for our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in
an effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.

Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to
streaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in
this area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around
these laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled
with potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory
or anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by
ISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of
service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of
which could harm our business.

In addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also offer consumers
multichannel video programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators
have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of
other companies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to
provide preferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to Intellectual Property                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
Litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our
products and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.

Some internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,
copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in
the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property
rights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against
us will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and
pending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent
litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of
our competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their
substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant
management time and divert management’s attention from our other business concerns. Uncertainties resulting from
the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in
the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.

As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be
required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or
royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to
gain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property
licenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the
scope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us
and our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially
including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual
property; cease making, licensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the
intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into
potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,
content, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties.

For example, we have in the past elected to develop and implement specific design changes to address potential
risks that certain products could otherwise become subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from
patent infringement and other intellectual property claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In
addition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to
resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.
                                                        56

If we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business
and operating results could be harmed.

We regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and
other intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual
property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek
to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and
invention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third
parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.

However, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop
our intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our
agreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach
that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to
obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential
proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade
secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or
misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a
trade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result in substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim
is unpredictable.

Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary
information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws
of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing
countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may
encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.
Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our
proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data
sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign
countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we
develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our
competitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a
competitive advantage in our market, which could harm our business.

We have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is
no guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained
will be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. U.S. patent laws,
and the scope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change
to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the
determination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more
frequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to
file more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any
issued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an
action in U.S. federal court. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to
protect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our business.

The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,
documentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to
take the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these
requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete
loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our
technologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.

We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain
locations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an
increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or
which we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. In particular, our actions to monitor
and enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit versions of our products or products
bearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from us,
tarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products.

Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,
or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,
regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management
and technical resources,
                                                        57

any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to maintain, protect, and
enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.

Our use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our
streaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.

We incorporate open source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have
incorporated open source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of
certain open source software or compliance with open source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject
to similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or our noncompliance
with the open source software license terms.

Although we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open source software, these processes
and procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many
open source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses
could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or
technology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. In such event,
we could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar open source
software license terms to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in
order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in
the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could harm our business.

Under our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract
manufacturers, and suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to
infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.

In certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing
partners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these
partners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were
to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary
liabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku TV partners often
involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there
is a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to
our technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually limited.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
Macroeconomic uncertainties have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.*

Global economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including
increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in
economic policy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global supply chain constraints. Such macroeconomic uncertainties may
continue for an extended period and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, many aspects of
our business.

Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic
consequences. While we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours and account activations at the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, more recently, we believe this growth has declined. In 2022, global supply chain disruptions
resulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices, and
some of our licensed Roku TV partners faced inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales.

Our business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both of which are
susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary
fears, and economic uncertainty. Sustained or worsening inflation or an economic downturn may result in fewer
consumer purchases of our products or the products of our licensed Roku TV partners (which could impact our active
account growth) and reduced advertising spending (which could impact our monetization efforts). Some of our
advertising verticals have experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product
availability, which, together with inflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers reducing
their overall advertising spend. If this pullback in
                                                        58                                                         
Table of Contents
consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending continues, our future operating results will be adversely
affected.

The extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact our operational and financial performance
remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may
negatively affect our business and operating results.

Natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and
impact our business.

Occurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,
internet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the Russian
invasion of Ukraine), terrorist attack, medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other man-
made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our business operations. Any of these business
disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.

In particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our
suppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these
areas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not
compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster.

In addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV
partners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,
wildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,
increasing intensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power
outages. Further, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.

If our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,
our ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the
operations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or
other catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed
Roku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our
business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster or other catastrophic event and to execute
successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.
                                                                                                                   
  Legal and Regulatory Risks                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
If government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business
change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.*

We are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to
the internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer
protection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,
payment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net
neutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,
among others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation
and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations
governing issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of
providers of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the
internet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing
regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.

As we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and
regulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing the reference design of TVs powered by Roku
OS, we were required to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing,
manufacturing, marketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations
regarding the manufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and we or our licensed Roku TV
partners may be unable to sell TVs powered by Roku OS at all, which could harm our business and our ability to grow
our user base.

Laws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer
protection, children’s online protection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little
harmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and
other government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and
other tracking technologies to collect, use, and share user information. Certain state laws, such as the CCPA, the
CPRA, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, also impose requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU
has laws requiring
                                                        59                                                         
Table of Contents
advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from users for the
placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In addition, the
EU has adopted the Digital Services Act, which is legislation that updates the liability and safety rules for
digital platforms, products, and services. If we or the third parties that we work with, such as contract payment
processing services, content publishers, vendors, or developers, violate or are alleged to violate applicable
privacy or security laws, industry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such violations and
alleged violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business and reputation
and subject us to potential liability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers, or publishers
to lose trust in us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws
may subject us to liability and reputational harm.

Our use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content
publishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).
Some of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to
activities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties.

In addition, the FTC has initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
(“COPPA”), which limits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children under
the age of 13. The review could result in broadening the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information
that are subject to these regulations. There have also been proposals in the U.S. Congress to amend and expand
COPPA. Changes to the COPPA legislation or rules could limit the information that we or our content publishers and
advertisers may collect and use and the content of advertisements in relation to certain channel partner content.
The CPRA and certain other state privacy laws also impose certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain
information about minors can be collected. California also has adopted a new law known as the Age Appropriate
Design Code Act, which will go into effect on July 1, 2024 and has a stated purpose of protecting “the wellbeing,
data, and privacy of children using online platforms.” Since adoption of that law, similar legislation has been
introduced for consideration in at least ten states in the United States. The EU and many of its member states,
among other jurisdictions, also have rules that limit processing of personal data, including children’s data, and
that impose specific requirements intended to protect children online. We and our content publishers and
advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other privacy, advertising, children’s
online protection, or similar laws.

Changes in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors
beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.

Our business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign
governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,
component suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly
on global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.

For example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of
tariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or
entities, as well as other business restrictions. Additionally, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United
States and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and
Belarus, and the United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take
other actions should the conflict further escalate. These and other geopolitical tensions and trade disputes can
disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of our products and the components required to manufacture our
products, as well as costs for our licensed Roku TV partners. This could cause our products and those of our
licensed Roku TV partners to be more expensive for consumers, which could reduce the demand for or attractiveness
of such products. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to
conduct business operations in that region. Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other
measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our
operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of
restrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the
adverse impacts from such measures.

Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have a negative impact on
consumer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. In particular, given the
general deterioration in U.S.-China relations and ongoing tensions on trade, security, and human rights, additional
U.S. sanctions, tariffs, and export or import restrictions, as well as Chinese sanctions or retaliatory measures,
remain a serious risk.

We cannot predict whether new international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing trade agreements
renegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the Biden Administration with other U.S.
trading partners; or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry
or our business or licensees. If any new legislation or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade
agreements are renegotiated or terminated, or if tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be
inefficient and expensive for us to alter our
                                                        60                                                         
Table of Contents
business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes, and higher prices could depress consumer
demand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, or cash flows.

Also, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,
commodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted
laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or
strategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in
those countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in
the introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or
strategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent
the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.
or foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-
border data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell
our products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to
source products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and
business or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,
or sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.

Although we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and
sanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within
our complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our
retailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls relating to such
compliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all
times or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our
retailers or partners. Any such potential violation could have negative consequences, including government
investigations or penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.

In addition, the effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be
far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic
conditions. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people
between the United Kingdom and the EU, and some disruptions have already occurred. Brexit could also lead to legal
uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws
to replace or replicate.

Although the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on the EU-UK post-Brexit economic relationship took effect on
January 1, 2021, it is incomplete, and the full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given these possibilities and
others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business,
results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.

U.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade
users’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the
provision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.

Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Laws, regulations, or court
rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including decisions that undermine
open and neutrally administered internet access, or that disincentivize internet access network operators’
willingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their equipment, could decrease customer demand for our
service offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our
business model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations governing the provision of internet access service.
Substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in 2015,
the FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,
blocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content
partners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules.

More recently, the Biden Administration signed an executive order encouraging the FCC to readopt comprehensive open
internet rules. The FCC therefore could consider adopting additional or modified rules to prevent internet access
network operators from unreasonably restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for data and services. If network
operators were to engage in restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede our growth,
result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our
ability to attract and retain users, any of which could harm our business. Several states and foreign countries in
which we operate also have adopted or are considering rules governing the provision of internet access.

As we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access
may be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination
are
                                                        61                                                         
Table of Contents
nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience
anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm
our business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or
applications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional
liabilities for us, which may harm our business.

If we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,
our business could be harmed.

As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark
infringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we
distribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the
“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce
Directive in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The
DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to
uncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that
limit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content
moderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit
our ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Moreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply
similar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could
incur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of
the content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may
suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability
could harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may
be imposed on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we
may be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright
infringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform.

While our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the
copyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in
certain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted
content. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our
ability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.

If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.

We are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such
internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report
by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This
assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control
over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be
materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are
unable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is
unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors
may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A
common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The
Nasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and
management resources.

Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.

U.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies
formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or
interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the
reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to
predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm
our business.
                                                        62

If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of
indirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our
noncompliance, which could harm our business.

We are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay
income taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on
business in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and
regulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are
numerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were
required to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax
liabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.

New legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform
policies could harm our business.

We earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States
and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or
their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.

Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are
taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in
what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have
an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.

In addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and
collaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has
resulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,
and the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require
adoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital
services taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.

The rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing
authorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have
cross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The
results of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period
or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged
in intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the
economics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose
and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates.

We have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and
proceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a
way that could seriously harm our business.

We have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government
entities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent
decrees, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other
penalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation,
and require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock
prior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their
affiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.*

Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President
and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our
outstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs
and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate
transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s
employment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder
approval.

In addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the
outstanding
                                                        63

shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A common stock
to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common
stock could be adversely affected.

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A
common stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B
common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of March 31, 2023, Mr.
Wood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only
owns 12.4% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our
“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably
believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.
Wood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our
stockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,
consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely
this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not
support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common
stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our
Class A common stock.

We have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for
companies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.

The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class
A common stock may decline.*

The market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;

• changes in projected operational and financial results;

• our loss of key content publishers;

• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;

• the commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;

• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;

• announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors;

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;

• capital-raising activities or commitments;

• additions or departures of key personnel;

• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;

• the use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial
performance;

• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;

• sales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;

• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;

• general economic and market conditions; and

• other events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or
public health crises, or responses to such events.

Furthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market
prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to
the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general
economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international
currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such
fluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.
In addition, we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been,
and may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation. Such litigation
could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.
                                                        64

Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional
dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.

We may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital
stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We
may sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more
transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in
subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could
gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.

Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.

If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common
stock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding
Class A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by
directors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our
directors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally
opens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly
financial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of
the fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,
at the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent
workers may also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the
requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is
dilutive to existing stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if
they downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

A limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot
assure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common
stock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A
common stock.

If securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or
issues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or
more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for
our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

We incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public
companies in the United States, which may harm our business.

As a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In
addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,
including SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs
and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying
interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time
and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail
to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against
us, and our business may be harmed.

Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,
including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and
coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events
could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, on
committees of our Board, or as members of senior management.

We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.*

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay
any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow
our business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, any future credit agreement we enter into could contain
prohibitions on the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of
their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future
gains on their investments.

Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to
change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class
A common stock may be lower as a result.

There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to
acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our
stockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:

• establishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;

• permitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;

• providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

• prohibiting cumulative voting for directors;

• requiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder
rights plan;

• eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a
meeting of our stockholders; and

• reflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.

Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or
combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in
excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
Any provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or
deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their
shares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class
A common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts
will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our
stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or
employees.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the
following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:

• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;

• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;

• any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate
of incorporation, or our bylaws; and

• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any
other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act
creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both
state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.

To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings
by different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal
district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under
the Securities Act.

While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder
may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In
such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum
provisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with
resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by
a court in those other jurisdictions.

These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it
finds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage
lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive
forum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur
further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which
could harm our business.
