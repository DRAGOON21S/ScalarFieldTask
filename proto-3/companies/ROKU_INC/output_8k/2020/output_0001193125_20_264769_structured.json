              "content": "On September 30, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc. approved the terms of an Executive Supplemental Stock Option Program (the “Program”) whereby our executive officers may elect to reduce their annual base salary for calendar year 2021 in exchange for a series of monthly grants of fully-vested nonstatutory stock options under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).",
              "subsections": {
                "enrollment_and_timing": "Each officer’s election to participate in the Program will be made under an Executive Supplemental Stock Option Program 2021 Enrollment Form and must be completed during the last open trading window in 2020. The Program will commence in January 2021.",
                "program_rules": "No officer participating in the Program may withdraw from the Program, unless the withdrawal is during an open trading window when the officer is not in possession of material, non-publicinformation and such withdrawal is due to an unforeseeable emergency. If an officer withdraws from the Program, they will not be able to re-enroll in the Program. No officer participating in the Program may change their election amount during the year.",
                "option_grant_formula": "The number of options granted will be determined based on the following formula: (i) the monthly dollar amount by which the officer has elected to reduce their annual base salary divided by (ii) the quotient of (x) the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant (the “Fair Market Value”) and (y) a factor intended to result in such quotient approximating a Black-Scholes value (the “Stock Option Ratio”), with the Stock Option Ratio to be in effect during 2021 will be determined prior to the initiation of enrollment. For example, if an officer elects to reduce their annual base salary by $20,000 per month to participate in the Program and the Fair Market Value is $50.00, then the officer will be granted an option to purchase the number of shares of our Class A common stock under the Program equal to (i) $20,000 divided by (ii) the quotient of (x) $50.00 divided by (y) the Stock Option Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share.",
                "grant_and_option_terms": "Each monthly grant will be made on the first trading day of the month (contingent upon the officer’s continued service as of that date), will be fully vested on the grant date and will have an exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value. The options will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and will be administered on a non-discretionary basis without further action by our Compensation Committee. These stock options will be exercisable for up to ten years following the date of grant regardless of the employment status of the officer.",
                "exhibit_reference": "The Supplemental Stock Option Program 2021 Enrollment Form and the form stock option grant notice and agreement to be used in connection with the Program are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
