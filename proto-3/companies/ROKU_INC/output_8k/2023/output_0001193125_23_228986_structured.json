                "non_gaap_reconciliation": "The Company is unable to reconcile net loss to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort; such reconciling items consist of other income (expense), net, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax (benefit)/expense where applicable, as well as the restructuring and impairment charges disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K.",

However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP financial information."
