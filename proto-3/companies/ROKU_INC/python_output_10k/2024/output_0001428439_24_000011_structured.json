          "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States by\nhours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV. We believe that all TV will be streamed. The shift of the TV ecosystem to\nstreaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for viewers, content partners, advertisers, and other\nindustry participants. Nearly every major media company not only has a streaming service, but has also expanded\nbeyond pure subscription streaming models to new ad-supported streaming options. Advertisers use TV streaming to\nreach viewers who are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV while also benefiting from the digital advertising\ncapabilities that TV streaming platforms can deliver.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nviewers, content partners, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect viewers to the\nentertainment they love; enable content partners to build, engage, and monetize large audiences; and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach viewers.\nOur Strategy and Business Model\nThe foundation of our platform is the Roku operating system (the “Roku OS”), which is purpose built for TV\nstreaming, and powers Roku streaming devices. The Roku OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware, which enables\nRoku streaming devices to be sold to customers at competitive prices. The Roku OS connects viewers to our streaming\nplatform via a broadband network, giving them access to a wide selection of content through a streaming experience\nthat is both delightful and easy to use. We provide updates via the Roku OS to continuously deliver an exceptional\nTV streaming experience.\nWe dedicate significant resources to build, maintain, and advance the Roku OS; to provide an industry-leading\nstreaming platform for our viewers, content partners, and advertisers; to obtain content for our streaming platform\nthat attracts viewers, including our own original programming (Roku Originals); and to extend Roku’s leadership as\nthe global shift to TV streaming continues.\nOur three-phased business model—grow scale, grow engagement, and grow monetization—drives our mission as a global\nstreaming platform that connects and benefits the TV ecosystem of viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We\nleverage our ownership of our streaming platform to help our viewers find content across the streaming universe,\nwhile simultaneously growing monetization.\nScale: Increasing the number of Active Accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable through a broad lineup of devices, at a variety of competitive price\npoints, including Roku TV models, Roku-branded TVs, and Roku streaming players.\nRoku TV models are TVs made and sold by our Roku TV partners, which are TV original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”) that license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV reference designs. We have driven strong Active Account\ngrowth through our Roku TV licensing program, which we launched 10 years ago.\nIn 2023, we launched Roku-branded TVs, which are designed, made, and sold by us. The Roku Select and Roku Plus\nSeries TVs are available at Best Buy, Amazon, and Costco in the United States, and the Roku Pro Series TV is\nexpected to be available in spring 2024. Roku-branded TVs complement our successful Roku TV licensing program. We\nbelieve our Roku-branded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position in TV streaming and expand into\nthe higher-end range of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of\nhardware and software and test directly with viewers, improving the product and viewer experience and strengthening\nthe entire Roku ecosystem.\nRoku streaming players enable users to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. On a periodic basis, we launch\nnew streaming player models with a focus on offering high performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nstreaming players to their subscribers in their markets.\n5\nTable of Contents\nThe Roku ecosystem extends beyond TV streaming to smart home devices that include cameras, video doorbells, a home\nmonitoring system, plugs, light bulbs, and light strips, along with our Roku Smart Home mobile application for iOS\nand Android. Similar to our TV streaming business model, we build scale by selling Roku Smart Home devices and then\nmonetize through smart home services. We offer subscription plans for our cameras, video doorbells, and home\nmonitoring system.\nAudio is an important part of the TV streaming experience, and we also offer Roku-branded wireless speakers and\nsubwoofers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by the Roku OS.\nThrough our streaming devices and the Roku platform, we provide viewers tremendous choice, value, and an\nexceptional viewer experience. In 2023, we added 10.0 million net Active Accounts, ending the year with 80.0\nmillion Active Accounts.\nEngagement: Growing Streaming Hours\nWe believe that offering viewers a wide range of content and an easy-to-use interface drives increased user\nengagement. We grew Streaming Hours from 87.4 billion hours in 2022 to 106.0 billion hours in 2023 through the\nincreased distribution of Roku streaming devices, increasing our Active Accounts, and continuing to enhance our\nviewer experience.\nOne of the key competitive advantages driving our success is our position as a TV streaming platform that has\nachieved significant scale—our home screen is the first thing our viewers see when they start their TV streaming\njourney. From this position, we can help the viewer decide what to watch across the vast range of options available\nto them on our streaming platform. We innovate and build features to support this critical role in the viewer’s\njourney, and it is a key driver of our monetization.\nThe Roku Home Screen Menu (left navigation bar) contains features such as Live TV, Sports, and What to Watch, and\nin 2023 we launched enhancements to make it even easier for viewers to find and discover great entertainment. For\nexample, we are enabling more personalization through recommendations and features that allow viewers to track TV\nshows, movies, and sports teams. Additionally, Roku’s powerful universal search makes it fast and easy when viewers\nare looking for specific content.\nWe also empower viewers to choose how much they want to spend on content by offering them a broad array of ad-\nsupported, subscription, and transactional options. Our direct relationship with customers provides us with\ndetailed insights about their behavior on our streaming platform, including certain content viewers search for, the\napps viewers install and watch, and the types of content that viewers purchase or subscribe to on our platform.\nThis first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content recommendations to improve our\nviewers’ experience.\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged viewers, tools that enable seamless sign ups, and\nmarketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content partners. They can also reach and engage\nthose viewers who no longer use or never used traditional TV services. As more viewers shift to TV streaming,\ncontent partners that publish apps on our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage\nviewers directly.\nOne of the key engagement drivers on our streaming platform is The Roku Channel, our owned and operated streaming\napp. The Roku Channel aggregates a broad variety of entertainment into a unified streaming experience, through\nthree distinct types of content:\nAVOD (ad-supported video on demand): Users can stream a broad variety of 80,000+ movies and TV shows, including\nRoku Originals, for free.\nLive TV : Users have access to watch 400+ FAST (free, ad-supported linear streaming TV) channels.\nPremium Subscriptions : Users can easily sign up, view, and manage subscriptions to dozens of streaming services\nthat require a subscription such as Paramount+ and AMC+ with a single, monthly bill.\nThe Roku Channel benefits from its integration with our streaming platform, which has features such as Live TV,\nSports, What to Watch, and more that can surface content from The Roku Channel to our viewers directly from our\nhome screen and throughout a viewer’s streaming journey on our platform. In 2023, The Roku Channel was a top 5 app\non our platform by both Active Account reach and Streaming Hours.\nThe foundation of our content strategy for The Roku Channel is third party licensed content and, to a smaller\nextent, Roku Originals. Our content spend is intended to be commensurate with the growth trajectory of The Roku\nChannel and with the broader macroeconomic environment. The Roku Channel is available on devices powered by the\nRoku OS in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. In the United States, it is also available\nonline at TheRokuChannel.Roku.com, and on Amazon Fire TVs, Samsung TVs, Google TV, and other Android TV OS devices.\n6\nTable of Contents\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services), as well as streaming\nservices distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions,\nand the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Previously, we referred to streaming services distribution\nas content distribution services. Our TV streaming platform enables content partners and advertisers to reach\naudiences that are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our streaming platform creates multiple\nrevenue opportunities for Roku through activities such as navigating through the Roku home screen, watching ad-\nsupported content, or signing up for subscription services. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating\nthe average revenue per user (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and\ngross profit.\nWe make it easy for content partners to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: subscription video on demand (“SVOD”), which includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\napps and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported video,\nwhich includes ad-supported video on demand (“AVOD”) apps with on demand content that do not charge a subscription\nfee to users, as well as free ad-supported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear\nstreaming TV; and transaction video on demand, which includes apps that offer a la carte content purchases or\nrentals. Through Roku Pay, our proprietary billing solution, we are also able to assist content partners with\nbilling services, including billing users for in-app purchases like content rentals, managing subscriptions, and\ncustomer invoices. Roku Pay allows content partners to enable a frictionless signup within their app, and we\nbelieve this key benefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for our content\npartners.\nContent partners also have access to our media and entertainment tools to help them attract, engage, and retain\nviewers by investing in promoting their content on our streaming platform. Content partners can use a variety of ad\nplacements, including native display ads on the Roku home screen or a screen saver to drive app downloads, promote\nan app’s content, and direct traffic to their apps in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show\nconsumption. We also derive revenue from the sale of branded app buttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote\ncontrols that are intended to increase incremental usage of an app by allowing viewers to launch straight into the\napp from any screen. Our analytics and reporting assist content partners with analyzing viewership trends and\nmetrics for specific titles, and we also can help content partners target new audiences that are more likely to\nsubscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of\ntools to reach viewers both on and off our streaming platform. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination of\nour significant scale, our direct relationship with viewers, and our advertising capabilities to serve relevant\nadvertisements. Advertisers on our platform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their\nreturn on investment.\nWe are developing new and deeper relationships with third-party ad-buying platforms (retail media networks, demand-\nside platforms (“DSPs”), and other strategic partners) to meet marketers where they currently are buying\nprogrammatic advertising. At the same time, our specialized ad products (such as Shoppable Ads, the Kroger Shopper\nProgram, native ad formats, and our audience guarantees) are accessible only on our advertising platform. This\noverall approach protects our strategic assets, while creating additional demand opportunities for our ad\ninventory. Advertisers can use third-party DSPs or OneView (our ad-buying platform) to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own.\nWe offer engagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We\nwork with a wide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and\naudience demographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform.\nFurthermore, we have relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data,\nwhich enables our advertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on\ntraditional TV. Additional promotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships that give viewers the\nopportunity to experience a free movie or show and sponsored themes in our viewer experience and shoppable ads that\nallow viewers to buy products directly from the TV screen. With shoppable ads, we are adding more performant tools\nand more partnerships to expand the capabilities we can offer advertisers.\nThe Roku Channel is also a core strategic asset in our monetization efforts that simultaneously benefits viewers,\ncontent partners, and advertisers, while generating increasing platform revenue. For viewers, The Roku Channel is a\ncompelling destination for a diverse selection of free and paid entertainment. For content partners, The Roku\nChannel provides a variety of options to distribute and monetize content through both licensing agreements and\nPremium Subscriptions. And for both content partners and advertisers, The Roku Channel delivers a large and engaged\naudience at scale that we believe will continue to grow. Owning and operating both The Roku Channel and the\nstreaming platform creates unique value, making us a leader in free content, positioning us to be a valuable\npartner to content partners, and providing a large source of ad inventory.\n7\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our streaming platform and increase the value we deliver\nto our viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our streaming platform to\nmeet evolving viewer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must\nprovide content partners with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to\ninnovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our platform. We aim to balance our commitment to achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA for full\nyear 2024 and our investments to further expand our scale, engagement, and monetization.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate our advertising offerings. In 2023, for the first time, Roku City (our dynamic screen\nsaver) was opened for major advertisers in a broader range of verticals, such as McDonald’s, Mattel, and Carnival\nCruise Line, which have integrated brand-specific visuals into our iconic screen saver. We also announced a number\nof partnerships to expand the value we can deliver to marketers. For example, we partnered with DoorDash to allow\ntheir merchants to place click-to-order offers within their Roku ads, and with Instacart to help consumer-packaged\ngoods (CPG) advertisers measure whether users are purchasing products on Instacart after seeing an ad on our\nstreaming platform. Building on the Shoppable Ad technology that we launched with Walmart in 2022, we partnered\nwith Shopify to enable users to purchase products from Shopify merchants directly from Roku devices. And Spotify\npartnered with Roku as its first TV streaming partner to introduce video ads in the Spotify app on Roku devices.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers viewers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers is as compelling in international markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku\nstreaming devices are available in 15+ countries. We are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States and\nMexico by hours streamed.\nInternationally, we continue to grow our footprint and deepen our presence in key markets. In Mexico, we announced\nRCA as a new Roku TV partner, an 8K Roku TV model with TCL, and new Roku TV models with Philips. Building on our\nexpansion in Latin America, we announced Roku TV models with Caixun in Chile and the launch of RCA Roku TV models\nin Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In the United Kingdom, we announced Roku TV models\nwith JVC (at Currys stores), Polaroid, and Sharp. And in Germany, we expanded our Roku TV program with our third TV\nOEM partner, Coocaa. In international markets, we will continue to focus on building scale first, increasing\nengagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nWe are successfully growing The Roku Channel internationally. The Roku Channel is available on devices powered by\nthe Roku OS in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico has become the channel’s largest international\nmarket. With strong scale and engagement, and the launch of our digital advertising business in 2022, we have begun\nto monetize in Mexico.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously grow scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content partners, advertisers, TV brands, retailers, and\nservice operators, and driving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to consumers\nthrough retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of our streaming platform among content partners, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content partners and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns.\nOur relationship with content partners is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content partner\nrelationship management team, we enter into agreements with content partners to distribute their apps on our\nplatform, or license their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD\napps, we typically secure direct access to a portion of the content partners’ video ad inventory for our\nmonetization, and our sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content partners. Whereas\nour content partners typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large\nstreaming audience across many apps and via other Roku branded experiences such as our home screen at once using\nour own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous key\nperformance indicators.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe are developing relationships with more third-party ad-buying platforms (e.g., retail media networks, DSPs, and\nother strategic partners) to reach marketers buying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create more\ndemand opportunities for Roku ad inventory. Our sales teams and products are organized into groups that specialize\nin the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and\nmid-market clients, (iii) content partners and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct-to-consumer\nbrands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\nplanning, manufacturing, and marketing. In the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website\n(excluding Roku TV models). We also sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon,\nBest Buy, and Walmart collectively accounted for 71% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 67% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We support retailers with an experienced sales\nmanagement team and work closely with these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix\nforecasting. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a higher\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nActive Accounts, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the fourth\nquarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and outsourced development and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new TVs, players, audio\nproducts, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content partners, advertisers,\nlicensed Roku TV partners, and service operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a\nproduct development process that seeks to take input from our partners into account when making decisions about our\nfuture product and service offerings. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features and\nenhancements to our platform. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development to bring\nnew or improved products and services to market.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and\nother contractors and vendors. All of our products are manufactured in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast\nAsia, and Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any\nspecific price. Our manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The\nmanufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in the United States and to our distributors in the\nUnited Kingdom and Brazil where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale distributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprotections, often bringing enforcement actions for unfair acts or deceptive practices related to privacy and\nsecurity. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are considering, legislation to govern consumer\nprivacy. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose different, and sometimes more stringent,\nconsumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer privacy laws, and regulators’\ninterpretations of these laws, may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and\ncosts associated with complying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit the ability of\nadvertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nTo the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of content over the internet, such operators\nmay seek to extract fees from us or our content partners to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in\nblocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact\nour business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,300 issued patents and 500 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our Active Accounts, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content\nstreamed through our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that viewers engage in through our\nplatform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach viewers on other content and advertising mediums,\nincluding on other ad-supported streaming services and social media apps;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer products that compete with our audio products or our smart home products and services; and\n10\nTable of Contents\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices or offer remote work positions that may be better\nable to attract and retain top talent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations,\nand other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects. Increasingly, we also compete with these same publishers in seeking to sell advertising to\nsupport the distribution of streaming content. A number of leading content publishers have launched new ad-\nsupported subscription tiers, which offer consumers access to content either for free or for a lower subscription\nfee.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2023, we employed approximately 3,150 full-time employees located in 15 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level. We\nalso emphasize integrity, transparency, and honesty in our internal and external conduct of business. All employees\nare required to comply fully with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, which sets forth our values, business\nculture, and practices.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to leverage\nour broad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to\nensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. Since the launch of our formal diversity, equity,\nand inclusion (“DEI”) strategy in 2020, we have made considerable progress on elevating awareness of DEI, promoting\ndialogue and empathy, implementing employee resource groups, and expanding representation on The Roku Channel and\nthe Roku platform.\nOur dedicated Inclusion Strategy team partners across Roku’s global footprint to develop strategies and lead\ncoordinated initiatives that advance inclusive employee and viewer experiences. Our four-part DEI framework\nincludes four pillars: Employee Experience, Attract and Source, Leading Inclusively, and Customer Experience.\nEmployee Experience : We facilitate an inclusive employee experience through our pay equity analysis, learning and\ndevelopment offerings, internal and external communications, employee resource groups (“ERG”), and mentoring. In\n2023, we continued our U.S. pay equity analysis to help ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and\nethnicity, year over year. Our six voluntary and employee-led ERGs are highly engaged and foster a diverse and\ninclusive workplace, build internal community, encourage career growth and networking, and support social impact\npartnerships. In 2023, we delivered DEI offerings in the areas of bias, inclusive conversations, bridging gaps\nacross differences, and allyship. Our DEI Talks series featured a diverse group of tech and entertainment and media\nleaders. We also increased the frequency of DEI communications to amplify our commitment, both internally and\nexternally.\nAttract and Source : Our Inclusive Recruiting Program Manager and DEI specialists embedded within our Talent\nAcquisition team directly contribute to our efforts to be inclusive. In addition, every member of our Talent\nAcquisition team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit candidates from different backgrounds. To that\nend, our recruiters are equipped to discuss DEI best practices with hiring managers to ensure we continue to widen\nthe candidate pipeline for all roles and create inclusive recruiting experiences. Furthermore, our U.S. university\nrecruiting and intern programs embed DEI into their strategies so that our recruiting pipelines include\nhistorically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and underrepresented clubs and\nprograms across other schools where we recruit.\nOur external relationships are also focused on organizations that reflect underrepresented communities, including\ntechnical and non-technical women and underrepresented minority organizations, to enable our hiring managers and\nrecruiters to attend or speak at related conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story\nto a wider audience.\n11\nTable of Contents\nLeading Inclusively : Our leaders are instrumental in sustaining inclusive employee and customer experiences. We\nseek to increase opportunities for leaders to demonstrate inclusive leadership. Members of our executive management\nteam volunteer to serve as executive sponsors for our ERGs, while additional leaders volunteer to be executive\nadvocates or chairs. We are also building inclusive leadership awareness into our training and people manager\nresources and communications.\nCustomer Experience : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our customer\nexperiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. We offer a slate of “inclusion zones” (including Black\nVoices, Pride, Latino Voices, Women’s Voices, and Asian and Pacific Islander Voices) on the Roku platform that\nhighlight and celebrate related stories from various content providers.\nCommunity Engagement and Social Impact\nWe have developed a Social Impact program that engages our local communities through employee volunteerism. Our\nprogram partners with organizations that provide opportunities for employees to mentor high school students through\nactivities such as career panels, industry masterclasses, and hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math\n(STEM) challenges.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase our new hires’\nspeed to productivity. In addition to mandatory training covering anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, and\nprivacy, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged training offerings covering topics such as high-\nperformance feedback, career development, change management, and communication skills. Managers are provided with\ntraining on expectations for managers and have access to a 1:1 leadership coaching program to support new and newly\npromoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical\nand non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase,\nand custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation opportunity, we consider what that employee would be\npaid by another employer, what we would have to pay to replace that employee if the employee leaves Roku, and the\namount we would pay to retain that employee. Generally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of\nsalary and equity awards rather than offering specific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by\ndifferent employees. We generally do not pay cash bonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions)\nor have performance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to our employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com.

industry is highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content\nowners and aggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to\ndifferentiate our streaming platform and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to\nattract and retain users and our business will be harmed.\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and\nretaining users on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need\nto be able to respond efficiently to changes in user tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the\ncontent they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features\nand functionality of our streaming platform for users, content partners, and advertisers. We also must effectively\nsupport popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video,\nDisney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in\nthe TV streaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku\nstreaming devices made by us and our licensed Roku TV partners. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating\nsystem software for integration into smart TVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its\noperating system software for integration into smart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have\ngreater financial resources than we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing\narrangements in order to promote their other products and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire\nnew users, retain existing users, increase Streaming Hours, and monetize our streaming platform. These companies\ncould also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or that provide a better\nstreaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands through advertising than\nwe do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast and\nCharter Communications (and their joint venture, Xumo, LLC), offer TV streaming applications and devices as part of\ntheir cable service plans and can leverage their existing user bases, installation networks, broadband delivery\nnetworks, and name recognition to gain traction in TV streaming. If viewers of TV streaming content prefer\nalternative products to Roku streaming devices, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in Active\nAccounts, Streaming Hours, platform revenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe also compete for Streaming Hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our Streaming Hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to continue to increase in the future. This increased competition could result\nin pricing pressure, lower revenue and gross profit, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our platform or our\nother products to gain or maintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a\nleading TV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing,\nservice and support, and device distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards and unknown future\ndevelopments may require further investments in the development of Roku streaming devices, our platform and our\nother products. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In addition, many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name\nrecognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other\nresources than us, which provide them with advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and\nofferings. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the\ndevelopment, promotion, sales, and distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance\nof their products better than we can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging\ntechnologies or standards and may be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition\ncould reduce our sales volume, revenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive\nposition, and otherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer our own lines of Roku-branded smart home products and services,\nincluding indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smart lighting, smart plugs, and home monitoring products,\nand audio products, including wireless speakers and subwoofers. As a result, we face additional competition from\nother brands of smart home products and audio products. If these products do not operate as designed or do not\nenhance the TVs powered by the Roku OS or other viewing experiences as we intend, our users’ overall viewing\nexperience may be diminished, and this may impact the overall demand for our products and our partners’ Roku TV\nmodels.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of streaming TV advertising and advertising platforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including social media and other digital platforms, as well as traditional media,\nsuch as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content\nand other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. For example, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video have launched ad-supported tiers in their\nstreaming services, which has further increased competition for streaming advertising revenue. If we are unable to\nincrease our revenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to\nfurther optimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory and reach, and\nmaintaining a strong advertising sales team and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects\nmay be harmed. We may not be able to compete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm\nour ability to grow our advertising revenue and would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in\ntraditional media or on other digital platforms, such as traditional TV, radio, print publications, and social\nmedia. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of streaming TV advertising and on advertisers\nincreasing their spending on advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers have shown growing\ninterest in streaming TV advertising, we cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that\nthey will not revert to traditional TV advertising or shift their advertising spending to social media and other\ndigital platforms (rather than to us). In addition, if we are unable to compete with social media and other digital\nplatforms to win business from advertisers and advertising agencies who have traditionally advertised on these\nplatforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be\nlimited. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of streaming TV\nadvertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results\nand our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political or regulatory pressure in some countries to limit streaming TV advertising (including\nlimiting the advertising that may be associated with children’s content) or impose local content requirements on\nstreaming TV services, which could pose a threat to our services.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content partners. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). As such, we are seeking to expand the number of Active Accounts\nand increase Streaming Hours in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base\ngrows and as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively\nmonetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of Streaming Hours, however, does not\ncorrelate with platform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour\nstreamed or every user on our platform. Moreover, Streaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku\nstreaming device is streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is\nconnected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the\nplayer, then the particular streaming app may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the\nstreaming app (although all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has\nbeen continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user interaction, which periodically\nprompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not\nrespond affirmatively).\nOur ability to deliver advertisements relevant to our users and to increase our platform’s value to advertisers and\ncontent partners depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or prevented by a\nnumber of factors, including the evolving data protection legal landscape. Users may decide to opt out or restrict\nour ability to collect viewing data or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content partners may also\nrefuse to allow us to collect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure\ncompliance with our legal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize\nprogram level viewing data from many of our most popular apps to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided\nto our users.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOther apps available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their apps by allowing users to purchase additional content and\nstreaming services within their apps; when users purchase these additional services within these apps, we may earn\nless revenue than when the services are purchased directly from us. If our users spend most of their time within\nparticular apps where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user information, or our\nusers opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant advertisements, we may not be\nable to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit. Additionally, our distribution agreements\nwith our most popular apps are renegotiated periodically; thus, even if we are currently able to monetize Streaming\nHours within an app, we may not be able to do so in the future. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming\nplatform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform through ad-supported content may not continue to grow as we expect,\nand our platform revenue growth has been, and may continue to be, lower than expected due to advertisers\nsignificantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to inflationary pressures, recessionary fears or other\nreasons that are out of our control. In addition, advertisers’ spending commitments, such as those we obtain in\nconnection with annual TV Upfront presentations, are typically not fully binding, and the revenue we receive from\nsuch commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. This means that in order to materially increase\nthe monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we will need to attract\nsignificantly more advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-supported content that\nresults in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIf we are not successful in running a demand-side platform (“DSP”) or in working with other third-party demand\nsources, our business may be harmed.\nThrough OneView (our proprietary DSP) and other third-party demand sources (such as third-party DSPs and supply-\nside platforms), advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage their streaming TV,\ndesktop, and mobile advertising campaigns both on and off the Roku platform. The market for programmatic streaming\nTV ad buying is an evolving market, and our current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not\ncontinue to shift to programmatic ad buying from other buying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the\nmarket for programmatic streaming TV ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and\nadvertising agencies may not use OneView or other third-party demand sources, and our business could be harmed. If\nwe are unable to expand our programmatic demand by maintaining and developing third-party demand relationships in a\nway that is competitive with other advertising platforms, our business could be harmed. In addition, if OneView or\nother third-party demand sources do not have the functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising\nagencies, they may take their advertising spend to a non-Roku platform. We also may not be able to adapt to changes\nor trends in programmatic streaming TV advertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue\nand harm our business.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand and manufacturing partners for the\ndevelopment, manufacture, and commercialization of licensed Roku TV models. We have developed, and intend to\ncontinue to develop and expand, relationships with these TV brand and manufacturing partners. We continue to invest\nin the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and international markets. For a\nnumber of years, the sale of Roku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has materially contributed to growth\nin our Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, and supported our platform monetization efforts. This growth has\nprimarily been driven by North America; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain\ninternational markets and has represented an increased share of new Active Accounts. We do not typically receive,\nnor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we typically incur operating\nexpenses in connection with establishing and supporting these commercial agreements.\nThe primary economic benefits that we derive from these license arrangements have been and will likely continue to\nbe indirect, primarily from growing our Active Accounts, increasing Streaming Hours, and thereby enabling us to\ngenerate more streaming services distribution and advertising-related revenue on our platform. If these\narrangements do not continue to result in increased Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, and if that growth does\nnot in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner (including as a result of our launch of Roku-branded TVs\nthat are designed, made, and sold by us) could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase\npricing and promotional pressures from other partners and retail distribution channels, increase our marketing\ncosts, and result in the loss of revenue. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new\nrelationships with any of these third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or other\nimpediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or maintain our business could be adversely impacted.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe have also developed licensing relationships with certain service operators, primarily in international markets;\nhowever, this program has been decreasing in scale in recent years, and as a result we have shifted the focus of\nour international growth to the sale of Roku streaming devices and expanding our Roku TV licensing program. Based\non the decreasing scale of our licensing program for service operators, including termination of these\nrelationships, we expect that the number of Active Accounts generated from this program will continue to decline,\nwhich may impact the overall growth rate of our Active Accounts in international markets.\nOur Roku TV licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and\npotential partners include TV brands, retailers, cable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources\nthese entities dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their\nforecasts and anticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to meet their\nforecasts or such launches in the future. If our licensed Roku TV partners or service operator partners fail to\nmeet their forecasts or such launches for distributing licensed streaming devices or choose to deploy competing\nstreaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content partners for a majority of our Streaming Hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content partners have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed on\nour platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the top three streaming services represented almost 50%\nof all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing apps that have historically streamed\na large percentage of the aggregate Streaming Hours on our platform, our Streaming Hours, our Active Accounts, or\nRoku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content. In order to remain competitive,\nwe must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content, particularly\nas we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by the Roku OS, or enter new markets, including\ninternational markets. If we are not successful in helping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming\napps and streaming app features that attract and retain a significant number of users on our streaming platform or\nif we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be harmed. Our ability to successfully\nhelp content publishers maintain and expand their app offerings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our\nability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming apps;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming apps; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain apps or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming apps or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand\ntheir audiences on our platform or their apps are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content partners may result in the removal of certain\napps or app features from our streaming platform and may harm our streaming device sales, Active Account growth,\nand engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content partners, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates and rights to terminate under certain circumstances. Our agreements with content partners\ngenerally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the end of the term by the content partner\nunder certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy,\ncommit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content partners’ security or other platform certification requirements.\nUpon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing\ncontent from these content partners on our streaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future\nmay not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content partners before our existing agreements\nhave expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, or if a\ncontent partner terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we may be required to temporarily or\npermanently remove certain apps or app features from our streaming platform.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe loss of such apps or app features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business.\nMore broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content partners on terms favorable to us, or at\nall, or if these content partners face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose app\npartners or users and our streaming device sales, Active Account growth, and engagement may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or generate\nsufficient demand to effectively sell our available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported apps on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content partners of such apps. We may fail\nto attract content partners that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on our\nstreaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming apps on our platform varies\ngreatly among apps. Accordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video ad inventory on our\nplatform. For certain apps, including YouTube’s ad-supported app, we have no access to video ad inventory at this\ntime and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services introduce new ad-supported\ntiers to their streaming services, we have in the past and in the future may not be able to reach agreement on\naccess to video ad inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. The amount, quality, and cost\nof video ad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient\nsupply of quality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nFurther, even if we have an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory, we may not be able to generate\nsufficient demand for such ad inventory or sell the ad inventory at our desired price. If we are unable to\neffectively sell our available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content partners do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content partners or meet their requirements. For example, some content partners have elected not\nto participate in our new home screen menu features or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage within\ntheir apps. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language in order\nto allow our content partners to develop and create apps on our streaming platform. Certain content partners may\nfind other languages, such as HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their\napps on other platforms. If key content partners do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to\ndevelop apps for, do not value and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform\noffers, or determine that our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their\nrequirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform decrease, or the\ncampaigns that run are not relevant or not engaging to our users, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to engage with more advertisers and content partners, and\nenable them to deliver more relevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our\nusers. However, a small number of content partners historically have accounted for a significant portion of the\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform, and we believe recent consolidation among\ncontent partners has resulted in decreased media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform.\nIf our content partners continue to decrease the media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our\nplatform, our financial condition and operating results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, existing and prospective advertisers and content partners may not be successful in serving ads and\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and\ncampaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance\nthe objectives of our advertisers and content partners with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but\nwe may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and\ncontent partners.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, are overly intrusive, or are too frequent and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using\nour platform, resulting in a reduction of our Active Accounts and Streaming Hours, which will harm our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. For example, we previously acquired content rights, including rights to certain projects in\ndevelopment, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and made The Roku Channel the home of\nsuch content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old House business, which own and produce\nthe “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related business lines, to further the growth\nstrategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel. We also commission original content that we own\nand distribute on The Roku Channel. From time to time, we may remove underperforming content from The Roku Channel\nand record an impairment change related to such removal, as we did in the third quarter of 2023.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers,\nusage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed. Further, even if we successfully monetize\nThe Roku Channel in the United States, we may not be successful in monetizing The Roku Channel in international\nmarkets.\nIn addition, we produce content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited\nexperience producing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing\nto our users and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with\ncontent production, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel\nare not relevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the\navailable content, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku\nChannel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition,\nwe distribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance\nthat we will be successful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising\nthrough the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other apps on our platform, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content partners activated on or through our platform,\nincluding Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from various content\npartners. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or subscriptions for any\nreason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content partners or by other\nmeans for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain apps available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin those apps. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn from\nsales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their spending on\nsuch in-app transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to grow our Active Accounts, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and for\nthe Roku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, MediaMarkt in Germany, and Currys in the United Kingdom. As we\nhave only recently expanded to certain international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or\nrelationships with retailers for those markets as compared to our retail sales channels in the United States or our\ncompetitors in international markets.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products that compete with our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts, including house-branded televisions sold by such retailers that utilize TV operating systems other than\nthe Roku OS. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors, and there can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with our retailers and distributors on\nterms we find acceptable or that will be consistent with our past practices. We may be reliant on certain retailers\nor distributors. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in total accounted for 71% and 67% of our devices revenue for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Furthermore, our licensed Roku TV partners\nmay be reliant on the same retailers and distributors or other retailers and distributors for a significant portion\nof their unit sales of Roku TV models. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue selling our\nproducts or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to prominently display those products in their\nstores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations, the volume of\nour products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could decrease, which would harm our business. These\nrisks may be exacerbated by our reliance on certain retailers or distributors, or when a major retailer in a\njurisdiction commercializes televisions under brands that the retailer controls.\nIn addition, if any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work exclusively with, or divert a\nsignificant portion of their business with us to, other operating system developers, this may adversely impact our\nability to continue to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and to grow Active\nAccounts and monetize the Roku OS. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in their stores and\nlimited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement space. Competition\nis intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger brand identity and\ngreater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart\nhome devices, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to\noffer or promote our products on its website. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our products, or\nincreased competition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing or other\nexpenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in reduced visibility for our products, which may\nharm our business. In particular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the\nholiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our products during\nthese periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor, and our\nbrand may be negatively impacted by factors that are out of our control, such as the quality and reliability of the\nRoku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content that our content partners\nprovide. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and consumer demand for their products\nmore quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may have greater\nresources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital advertising, or\nwebsite product placement. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be difficult to\ndifferentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, which may adversely\naffect our ability to attract and retain users and harm our business.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of apps, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content partners. Our users can choose and control which apps they download and watch, and\nthey can use certain settings to prevent apps from being downloaded to Roku streaming devices. While we have\npolicies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-\nparty rights, among other things, we may distribute apps that include controversial content. Controversies related\nto the content included on certain apps that we distribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in,\nnegative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. Further,\nwe typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While\nwe attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not\nalways successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than\nour accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements, or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users, advertisers, content partners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve issues relating to our products and our streaming\nplatform. A high level of support is critical for the success of our business. We currently outsource the majority\nof our customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end\nusers. In addition, we train our licensed Roku TV partners and service operator licensees to provide first-level\ncustomer support to users of Roku TV models and other devices. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage\nour third-party customer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if that support organization\ndoes not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely\naffect our ability to monetize our streaming platform, to sell our products to users and could harm our reputation\nwith potential new customers and our licensees.\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. The introduction of a new product or service is a complex task, involving significant\nexpenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to\nnew risks. The introduction of new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may\nresult in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications\nthat could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. For example, we have faced and may\ncontinue to face new intellectual property infringement claims related to new products and services we have\nintroduced. In addition, our entrance into entirely new lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV\nstreaming and advertising, such as our launch of Roku-branded smart home products (including home monitoring\nproducts) and shoppable ads that allow users to purchase advertised products and services directly from their Roku\nstreaming devices, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ from the risks we face as a\nresult of our historical TV streaming business. In particular, the provision of home monitoring services is a\nhighly regulated industry where various licensing requirements may apply in each jurisdiction where such services\nare offered.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. The development of\nnew products and services is a highly complex process, and we do not expect that all of our projects will be\nsuccessful.\nThe successful development and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays;\nour ability to obtain required licenses and comply with other regulatory requirements; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or services\nin a timely or cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract\nmanufacturers, and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from labor disputes, strikes, mechanical\nissues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health crises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems in the past have impaired, and could in the\nfuture impair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in\nour contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers.\nAlternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy\nour production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely\nbasis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our\nrevenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the tensions between\nTaiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese suppliers,\nour supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international location of these\nfacilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on\nexports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports: restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower Active Accounts and Streaming Hours growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by the Roku OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi\nfront-end module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a\nsecond source.\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflict, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content partners\nand other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to users. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all apps\nand other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners, including virtual multi-channel video\nprogramming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings, technologies, and\nsystems beyond our app certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not provide our users with a\nhigh-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are made to those offerings that\nare not compatible with Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase Active Account growth and user\nengagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, the Roku-branded TVs we launched\nin 2023 and our recently announced Roku Pro Series TVs, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such\nproducts to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content\npartners have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their apps. The certification\nprocesses can be time-consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If our\ncontent partners do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain\ncertifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products\nto all licensed Roku TV partners or we may not continue to offer certain apps. To continue to grow our Active\nAccounts and user engagement, we will need to prioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with\nnew offerings, technologies, and systems, including our smart home products and services. If we are unable to\nmaintain consistent operability of Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms,\nour business could be harmed.\nIn addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners may impact the\naccessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku streaming devices. We may not\nsuccessfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings, technologies, or\nsystems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings, technologies, or systems,\nour business could be harmed.\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any number of ways\nin our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, data\nloss or poor quality, device malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. Some errors may only be\ndiscovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be detected under certain\ncircumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance\nprocesses, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such update.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\n25\nTable of Contents\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable cost and expense. Should we have a\nwidespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to\ndevelop new products or streaming platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize or enable certain industry standard and other commercially available technology in our products and\nstreaming platform that is licensed by third parties. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to\nour products and on our streaming platform, we may be required to license additional technologies from third\nparties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies\nwith lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of\nour products, streaming platform, and our business.\nWe are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and services, which may present operational and\nreputational risks.\nWe have incorporated and intend to continue incorporate AI technologies, such as generative AI, into our products\nand services. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could adversely impact our business.\nFor example, AI technologies can create accuracy issues, unintended biases, and discriminatory outcomes, or may\ncreate content that appears correct but is inaccurate or flawed. If the recommendations, content, or analyses that\nAI applications produce are or are alleged to be deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive\nharm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI\ntechnologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and\nprivacy and data protection. For example, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of\nintellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Compliance with\nnew or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and\nmay limit our ability to develop, deploy or use AI technologies. There can be no assurance that the measures we\nhave taken to mitigate the potential risks related to generative AI will be sufficient. Failure to appropriately\nrespond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational\nharm.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we may continue to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability\nagain in the near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,297.6 million. Our operating expenses\nhave increased in the past and may increase again in the future as we expand our operations and invest in growth\nand new areas. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may\nnot be able to achieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of\nreasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may\nencounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may\nresult in losses in future periods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\n26\nTable of Contents\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our Active Accounts, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory on\nour advertising platform;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, apps, or features;\nthe addition or removal of content or apps from our platform;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in legal costs, including costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending\nagainst third-party intellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual\nproperty.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment (which generates revenue from\nthe sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related\naccessories, as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators) experienced negative gross\nmargins for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and our platform segment (which generates revenue from the\nsale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, media and entertainment\npromotional spending, and related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and\ntransaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote\ncontrols)) experienced positive gross margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Gross margins on our\nstreaming devices vary across models and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and\nconfiguration changes, component costs, device returns, and other cost fluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or retail sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin or record\nnegative gross margin on devices in an effort to increase the number of Active Accounts and grow our gross profit.\nAs a result, our devices segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless\nwe are able to continue to increase our platform segment revenue and grow the number of Active Accounts, we may be\nunable to grow gross profit and our business will be harmed. For example, in the past, global supply chain\ndisruptions have resulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in\ncomponent prices, which negatively affected our devices gross margin. If a reduction in gross margin does not\nresult in an increase in our Active Accounts or an increase in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial\nresults may suffer, and our business may be harmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past,\nand may experience in the future, lower gross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower\nthan we anticipate, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and may continue to expand certain of these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and any future growth will continue to place, significant demands on\nour management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\n27\nTable of Contents\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have previously undertaken restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and manage our operating\nexpenses, and we may do so again in the future. For example, in 2023, we approved measures to lower our year-over-\nyear operating expense growth rate by consolidating our office space utilization, performing a strategic review of\nour content portfolio, reducing outside services expenses, and slowing our year-over-year headcount expense growth\nrate through workforce reductions and limiting new hires, among other measures.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, material costs and charges in connection with restructuring plans\nand initiatives, and there can be no assurance that any restructuring plans and initiatives will be successful. Any\nrestructuring plans may adversely affect our internal programs and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and\nmotivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, or inefficiency during\ntransitional periods, may require a significant amount of employees’ time and focus, and may be distracting to\nemployees, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. For more information, see Note 17 to\nthe consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or are unable to manage our\ngrowth and expansion plans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business,\noperating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and\nhave greater experience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, use of AI technologies, copyright and intellectual property, and local content and advertising\nrequirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nprohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records\nand a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by\nincumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\n28\nTable of Contents\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming apps or content to users in certain international\nmarkets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of\nUkraine and the Israel-Hamas war), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic\ntensions (such as the tension between China and Taiwan), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nany pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the\nuse of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Item 7A of this Annual Report for additional information);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our business model in international markets. Three\ncore areas of focus define our business model: first, we grow scale by increasing our Active Accounts; second, we\ngrow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform; and, third, we grow monetization\nof the activities that users engage in through our platform. Even if we are able to increase our Active Accounts in\ninternational markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our Streaming Hours or monetize user activity in those\nmarkets. Further, as of December 31, 2023, our ARPU was lower in international markets than in the United States.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday seasons fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit are\ntraditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total net\nrevenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to grow our Active Accounts, which typically\nreduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our product sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, reductions in consumer discretionary spending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our\nsupply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or air freight delays, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly.\nFor example, macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures negatively affected consumer electronics sales\nduring the holiday season in 2023. In addition, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the past, and\nmay in the future, adversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver products to\nretailers during holiday seasons.\n29\nTable of Contents\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. To attract top talent,\nwe generally offer competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In\naddition, many companies now offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for\nemployees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and\nmay in the future need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition\nand other business and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled\nemployees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\npast or any additional workforce reductions could harm employee morale and negatively impact employee recruiting\nand retention.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content partners, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could\nadversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and\ndisputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial\nreturns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen\noperating difficulties and expenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies\ninvolve areas of operation in which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products,\nor technologies in international markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of\noperations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at\nall, without incurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address\nsuch risks successfully, our business could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nIn addition, we currently have no committed source of financing, and may need to obtain financing via a credit\nfacility in the future. Any future credit agreements we may enter into could require a lien on our assets or\ncontain financial covenants and other restrictions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise\nadversely affect our financial condition. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\nsatisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to\nbusiness challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nWe maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial\ninstitutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the\nFDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not\ninsured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited\nliquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns\nor rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed\nand was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or\ncredit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity\nand financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable\ninsurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial\ninstitution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government\ninstitutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, user video and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential\ninformation. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry\nstandards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of personal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security\nsafeguards as part of an information security program, and complying with requirements regarding the use or cross-\nborder transfer of such personal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our\nbusiness partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to\nexisting and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and user video\nand audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or\ncould have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential\ninformation. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex.\nWhile all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security\nbreaches, incidents, attacks, and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our\ninformation technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems,\nmake such systems vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal, and external threats on our technology\nenvironment. Vulnerabilities can be, and have been, exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our\nemployees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have experienced,\nand remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, improper employee\naccess of confidential data, and inadvertent employee disclosure of confidential data. Malicious attacks are\nincreasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to,\nindustrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others.\nThe geopolitical conflicts stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the current unrest in the Middle East\nhave increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations globally, including for companies\nheadquartered in the United States, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and\nability to produce, sell, and distribute our devices and services.\nMost of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols, the actions of our employees while working from home may\nhave a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of\ncompromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from employees’ combined use of personal and\nprivate devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to\ntransmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent partners’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRecent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks,\nwith increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and\nmethodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may impact our\nability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors experience an\noutage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally, our third-party\nvendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such third parties\nfor use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open-source software, which may be incorporated into our\nsystems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which we are not\naware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. We cannot assure you that we will not be impacted by\nransomware, cybersecurity attacks, or other vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that security incidents may not be covered by our insurance\npolicies, and not all aspects of a security incident may be covered even where coverage exists. Insurance policies\nwill also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security incident. Even where an incident is\ncovered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we\nmay be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our streaming platform, streaming\ndevices, smart home products, website, computer systems, or mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business,\nsubject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our\nreputation. Efforts to prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in\nour products are expensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or\nvulnerabilities.\nSuch unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk\nof contractual damages, litigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of\nharm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings\nand as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial\nresources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time-consuming,\ndistracting, and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations,\nand contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This\ncould result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents.\nData protection laws around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and\norganizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and\nevolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or\nreasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in\naccordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain. In addition\nto potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a data security incident, which could\nadversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential\ninformation, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nother consumers, employees, job applicants and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect,\nprocess, transmit, and store personal or confidential information (including our users’ payment card data and video\nand audio recordings). We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service\nproviders and our business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related\ntechnologies, to help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and\npartners’ content and deliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our\npartners on our products.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent partners’ streaming apps. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully leverage\nthis data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be restricted\nby a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our service\nproviders’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by advertisers,\ncontent partners, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws, regulations,\nand industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit access to or\nstorage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for advertising)\nthat is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of a\ntransmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes.\nAdditionally, certain device manufacturers or operating system providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, or otherwise restrict the collection of personal information through these or other tools,\nvia our applications. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our\nrevenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising\ncampaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally.\n34\nTable of Contents\nPrivacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”),\nstate attorneys general, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian\nnational data protection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and\nforeign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict\nindustry participants’ ability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of\nconsumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies or collect\ncategories of personal information deemed sensitive. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation\n(“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, and use of personal information related\nto people located in the EU (or which is processed in the context of EU operations) and places data protection\nobligations and restrictions on organizations, and may require us to make further changes to our policies and\nprocedures in the future beyond what we have already done. In addition, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s\nwithdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted a framework similar to the GDPR. The EU has\nrecently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being “adequate” to receive EU personal data. We are\nmonitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data protection framework and the impact this may\nhave on our business.\nWe will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not\ncompliant with data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines\nand penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For\nexample, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant\ncompany, whichever is higher, as well as data processing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of\nthe GDPR’s requirements.\nData protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. The\nU.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based data\nprivacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider additional\ndata privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and may require\nus to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to\ncomply. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides for civil penalties for violations, as\nwell as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California\nPrivacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amended the CCPA and became effective on January 1, 2023 (with a “look-back” to\nJanuary 1, 2022), and among other things, requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate and enforce\nthe CCPA.\nFurthermore, rules governing new technological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain\nunsettled. Several national and local governments have proposed or enacted measures related to the use of AI\ntechnologies in products and services. For example, in the EU, there is a proposed regulation related to AI that is\nproceeding towards adoption. If adopted, this regulation could impose new and substantial obligations related to\nthe use of AI-related systems. In the United States, there similarly is growing interest among federal, state, and\nlocal policymakers with respect to potential legislation, regulation and/or guidance to address perceived concerns\nwith the rapid uptake of AI technologies. The rules and regulations adopted by policymakers over time may require\nus to make changes to our business practices.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business. Among other things, such restrictions are likely to increase the number of users\nto whom we cannot serve targeted advertising, and are likely to restrict our ability to collect and process certain\ntypes of information deemed sensitive under these new laws. The Canadian province of Quebec has also recently\nenacted a data protection law, known as Bill 64, that may similarly restrict our data processing activities.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. After a period of uncertainty concerning certain mechanisms for data transfers to the United States, on\nJuly 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision concerning a new framework for data transfers\nfrom the EEA to the United States, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”).\n35\nTable of Contents\nThat decision recognizes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal information\ntransferred from the EEA to organizations participating in the EU-U.S. DPF. The United Kingdom has made a similar\ndetermination, providing a means by which data transfers may take place between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nThat framework is known as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and it went into effect on October 12, 2023. Roku\nis currently evaluating participation in the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension.\nIn addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny from EU\nregulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal\ninformation outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate.\nWe continue to assess the available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data\nProtection Authorities and the U.S. Department of Commerce on international data transfer compliance for companies,\nincluding guidance on specific supplementary measures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data\nsharing that may be deemed a cross-border transfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our\nability to continue to transfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may\nsubject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience\noperating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CPRA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so.\nMoreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, representatives,\nagents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state, and federal action if they\nare found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku OS, streaming platform, smart home products,\nand computer systems. For example, our smart home product line is reliant on (among other things) the engineering\nand software development teams and information technology systems of the service providers we use to assist in the\ndesign, manufacture, and maintenance of those products. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we\nexercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that\nthey may experience.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn the future, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud\ncomputing services, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to\nmanage such a transition effectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services, operational delays, or\ninefficiencies until the transition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with\nthird-party vendors, we may not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions,\nincluding service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor\ncould subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In addition, fires,\nfloods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-\nins, and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide users with access to the internet also offer users multichannel\nvideo programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators have an\nincentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other\ncompanies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide\npreferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us and may seek to challenge\nthe validity or enforceability of our own patents and patents applications. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of our competitors may\nbe better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater\nfinancial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and\ndivert management’s attention from our other business concerns or otherwise adversely affect our business and\noperating results. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other\nproceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nharm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all, thereby hindering our ability to sell or use the relevant technology, or requiring redesign of the\nallegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time‐consuming, or impossible. Even if\nwe are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and\nthe rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to gain access to the same\nintellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property licenses may not include\nrights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the scope of the licenses\ngranted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us and our licensees.\nFurthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making,\nlicensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of\nothers; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into potentially unfavorable\nroyalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials;\nand indemnify our partners and other third parties.\nFor example, we have in the past elected to develop and implement specific design changes to address potential\nrisks that certain products could otherwise become subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In\naddition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to\nresolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\ndiscover such breaches, and if we do, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot\nguarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that\ncompetitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent\ninformation and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim\nthat a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result\nin substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information.\nOur efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to\nprevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including\nbusiness decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our\nbusiness. We have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be\ninnovative. There is no guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the\nprotection gained will be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nU.S. patent laws, and the scope of coverage afforded by them, have been subject to significant changes, such as the\nchange to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in\nthe determination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Foreign patent laws may also continue to develop and significantly impact our ability\nto protect or maintain our intellectual property. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant\nimpact on our ability to protect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our\nbusiness.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Despite the cost and time we spend\nmonitoring, we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be\nharmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In\nparticular, our actions to monitor and enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit\nversions of our products or products bearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace,\nwhich could divert sales from us, tarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products. In some\ncircumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property\nposition or for other business reasons.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open-source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open-source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open-source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open-source software or compliance with open-source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open-source software license terms.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open-source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen-source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. Some open‐source\nsoftware is governed by licenses containing conditions that any person who distributes or uses a modification or\nderivative work of software that was subject to an open‐source license make the modified version subject to the\nsame open‐source license. Distributing or using software that is subject to this kind of open‐source license can\nlead to a requirement that certain aspects of our solutions be distributed or made available in source code form.\nIn such event, we could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar\nopen-source software license terms to third parties, including competitors, at low or no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the\nsale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nFurther, use of open‐source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third‐party\ncommercial software, as open‐source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title,\nperformance, non‐infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. Open‐source software typically lacks\nsupport, and authors of such open‐source software may abandon further development and maintenance. Open‐source\nsoftware may contain security vulnerabilities and other liabilities, and we may be subject to additional security\nrisk by using open‐source software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, but there can be\nno assurance that these processes will alleviate all risks with the open‐source software we incorporate.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturers,\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent or other property infringement based on allegations related to our technology.\nIf a partner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to\nsignificant monetary liabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku\nTV partners often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in\ncircumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the\nclaim does not pertain to our technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually\nlimited.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties, including increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and\ncredit market fluctuations, changes in economic policy, bank failures, labor disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nglobal supply chain constraints have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact many aspects of our\nbusiness. For example, our business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both\nof which are susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates,\nrecessionary fears, and economic uncertainty. Sustained or worsening inflation or an economic downturn may result\nin fewer consumer purchases of our products or the products of our licensed Roku TV partners (which could impact\nour Active Account growth) and reduced advertising spending (which could impact our monetization efforts). We\nbelieve advertising budgets in a variety of industries have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising\ninterest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced advertiser spending, which has adversely\naffected our platform revenue. Any continued pullback in consumer discretionary spending or advertising spending\ncould adversely affect our future operating results. In addition, a significant reduction in the supply of original\nentertainment content, including as a result of macroeconomic factors or labor disputes (such as the 2023 strikes\ncalled by the Writers Guild of America and SAG‐AFTRA), could in turn reduce the demand for advertising and media\nand entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform, and have a material adverse effect on our growth\nin Active Accounts and Streaming Hours or negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact our operational and financial performance\nremains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may\nnegatively affect our business and operating results.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war), terrorist attack and other geopolitical conflicts (such as Yemen’s\nHouthi attacks in the Red Sea), medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), government shutdown\norders, other man-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our, our business partners’ and\ncustomers’ business operations or result in disruptions in the broader global economic environment. Any of these\nbusiness disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power\noutages. Further, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and to\nexecute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing the reference design of TVs powered by the\nRoku OS, we were required to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations\nregarding the manufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and we or our licensed Roku TV\npartners may be unable to sell TVs powered by the Roku OS at all, which could harm our business and our ability to\ngrow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, children’s online protection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little\nharmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and\nother government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and\nother tracking technologies to collect, use, and share user information. Certain state laws, such as the CCPA, the\nCPRA, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, also impose requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, the EU has adopted the Digital Services Act, which is legislation that updates the liability and safety\nrules for digital platforms, products, and services. The EU also recently adopted the Data Act, which seeks to\nenhance interoperability and facilitate data sharing and reuse across products and services.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory investigations and enforcement actions could also impact our business operations. For example, we and\nother companies in the media, entertainment, and advertising technology industries have been subject to government\ninvestigation by regulatory bodies with regard to our compliance with data privacy and security laws. Advocacy\norganizations have also filed complaints with data protection authorities against businesses with streaming apps\nand advertising technology, arguing that certain of these companies’ practices do not comply with the CCPA or other\nregulations. Such investigations or enforcement actions may require us to alter our practices. Further, if we or\nthe third parties that we work with, such as contract payment processing services, content partners, vendors, or\ndevelopers, violate or are alleged to violate applicable privacy or security laws, laws concerning access to data,\nindustry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such violations and alleged violations may also\nput our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business and reputation and subject us to potential\nliability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers, or content partners to lose trust in us,\nwhich could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to\nliability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npartners at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). Some\nof our content partners have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to activities\non our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties.\nIn addition, in 2019, the FTC initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection\nAct (“COPPA”), which limits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children\nunder the age of 13. Following this review, in December 2023, the FTC issued a formal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\nthat proposes specific revisions to the COPPA rule and seeks additional public input. Among other topics, the FTC\nhas proposed rule changes that would prohibit targeted advertising to children absent express opt-in consent from\nparents, strengthen data security requirements for children’s personal information, and limit the period during\nwhich children’s personal information can be retained. The review has not been concluded and could result in\nbroadening the applicability of COPPA and other changes.\nThere have also been proposals in the U.S. Congress to amend and expand COPPA. Changes to the COPPA legislation or\nrules could limit the information that we or our content partners and advertisers may collect and use and the\ncontent of advertisements in relation to certain app partner content. The CPRA and certain other state privacy laws\nalso impose certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain information about minors can be collected.\nCalifornia also has adopted a new law known as the Age Appropriate Design Code Act, which has a stated purpose of\nprotecting “the well being, data, and privacy of children using online platforms.” A federal district court in\nCalifornia granted a preliminary injunction preventing that law from going into effect during the pendency of\nlitigation challenging it on constitutional grounds, and the California Attorney General has since asked a federal\nappeals court to lift that injunction. At the same time, since adoption of the California law, similar legislation\nhas been introduced for consideration in other U.S. states. The EU and many of its member states, among other\njurisdictions, also have rules that limit processing of personal information, including children’s data, and that\nimpose specific requirements intended to protect children online. We and our content partners and advertisers could\nbe at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other privacy, advertising, children’s online\nprotection, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and\nother countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and\nthe United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions\nshould the conflict further escalate. In addition, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and\ndiplomatic relations continue to be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more.\nContinued uncertainty and friction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international\noperations.\nThese and other trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, or political uncertainty can disrupt supply chains and\nincrease the cost of our and our partners’ products, and have a negative impact on consumer confidence, which could\nimpair our future growth and adversely affect our international operations, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation by us, our retailers, or our partners could have negative\nconsequences, including government investigations, enforcement actions, monetary fines, or civil and/or criminal\npenalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. We believe that the continued\ngrowth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective\nbroadband internet access (including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband\ncontent delivery, and broadband service providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content\ntraveling on their networks. Laws, regulations, or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in\nuse of the internet, including decisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, or that\ndisincentivize internet access network operators’ willingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their\nequipment, could decrease customer demand for our service offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could\ncause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations\ngoverning the provision of internet access service. Substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and\nelsewhere regarding such provisions.\nFor example, in 2015, the FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from\nunreasonably restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by\nus and our content partners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. In September 2023, the FCC formally\nproposed to restore the 2015 open internet rules and re-establish the FCC’s role in overseeing broadband providers,\nalthough some representatives of broadband providers have already stated that they may challenge such a decision in\ncourt.\nIf network operators were to engage in restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede\nour growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise\nimpair our ability to attract and retain users, any of which could harm our business. Several states and foreign\ncountries in which we operate also have adopted or are considering rules governing the provision of internet\naccess. In addition, in some jurisdictions (including the United States), network operators are pursuing proposals\nthat would require or enable them to impose fees on content providers related to delivery of network traffic.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of apps that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are unable to continue to\ncomply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an\nopinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in\nthe accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nThe generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting\nprinciples. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results\nof operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness\nof a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could harm our business.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to litigation, claims, regulatory inquiries,\ninvestigations, and other legal proceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to\nchange our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various legal proceedings, claims, arbitration\nproceedings, and investigations and inquiries from government entities, including with regard to intellectual\nproperty, employment, consumer and data privacy, corporate governance, and commercial disputes, among other\nmatters. These matters are inherently uncertain. Any proceedings, claims, or inquiries initiated by or against us,\nwhether successful or not, may be time-consuming, subject us to damage awards, regulatory orders, consent decrees,\ninjunctive relief, fines, or other penalties or sanctions, require us to change our policies or practices, result\nin increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us to incur\nsignificant legal and other expenses. In addition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all\nmaterial expenses related to pending and future claims. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2023, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.2% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content partners;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nthe perception that our environmental, social, and corporate governance performance is inadequate compared to\nthat of our competitors;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been,\nand may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation. Such litigation\ncould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.\n46\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year, at\nthe end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent workers\nmay also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is dilutive to\nexisting stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, on\ncommittees of our Board, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, any future credit agreement we enter into could contain\nprohibitions on the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of\ntheir Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future\ngains on their investments.\n47\nTable of Contents\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business.\n48\nTable of Contents",

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nOur enterprise-wide approach to risk management is designed to support the achievement of our organizational and\nstrategic objectives and improve long-term organizational performance. Cybersecurity is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the enterprise risks that are subject to\noversight by our Board and the Audit Committee of our Board (the “Audit Committee”).\nOur cybersecurity program is designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Key\ncomponents of our cybersecurity program include:\nmanaging cybersecurity threats by deploying technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information\nsystems from cybersecurity threats, which we evaluate and seek to improve, including through vulnerability\nassessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence;\nmaintaining cybersecurity incident management procedures to address incident reporting, classification,\nescalation, response, and recovery, and facilitate efficient and consistent management of cybersecurity incidents\ninvolving our information systems;\nassessing and testing our cybersecurity policies and practices via internal efforts (such as assessments,\nvulnerability testing, threat modeling, tabletop exercises, and other exercises focused on evaluating the\neffectiveness of our cybersecurity measures) and by engaging third parties (including cybersecurity consulting\nfirms) to perform assessments of our cybersecurity measures;\na third-party cybersecurity risk management process, including, among other things, a security assessment and\ncontracting process for vendor applications and implementing contractual security measures with third-party\nvendors; and\ncybersecurity awareness training for all employees and enhanced training for certain employees.\nCybersecurity Governance\nAs part of its broader risk oversight activities, the Board oversees risks from cybersecurity threats, primarily\nthrough delegation to the Audit Committee. As reflected in its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in\nreviewing our significant cybersecurity matters and concerns. The Audit Committee engages on cybersecurity matters\nwith our management team, including our Vice President of Trust Engineering, who regularly provides presentations\nto the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity program and cybersecurity risks. These presentations address a range of\ntopics including, for example, the threat landscape and cybersecurity events, vulnerability assessments, incident\npreparedness assessments, disaster recovery plans, and cybersecurity awareness training. Two additional members of\nour Board, who have cybersecurity experience but are not members of the Audit Committee, are invited to attend\nAudit Committee meetings when review of our cybersecurity program is on the agenda. In addition, the full Board\nreceives regular updates on the activities of the Audit Committee, including with regard to cybersecurity\noversight.\nOur Vice President of Trust Engineering is principally responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management\nprogram, in partnership with other members of management. Our Vice President of Trust Engineering has served in\nvarious roles in cybersecurity and information technology for over 30 years, including as Vice President and Chief\nSecurity Architect of Intertrust Technologies Corporation and Java Security Architect at Sun Microsystems, Inc.\nIn addition, our Executive Incident Management Team (“EIMT”) is a cross-functional management committee focused on\nproviding executive guidance on the cybersecurity incident response process to facilitate an appropriate and timely\nresponse, make decisions related to cybersecurity incidents, and notify appropriate parties with relevant cross-\nfunctional expertise in the event of a cybersecurity incident.\nOur Trust Engineering team is responsible for the day-to-day identification, assessment, and management of\ninformation security risks and provides regular updates to our Vice President of Trust Engineering regarding the\nprevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents are\nescalated to our Vice President of Trust Engineering, the EIMT, and the Chair of our Audit Committee in accordance\nwith our cybersecurity incident management procedures, so that decisions can be made regarding incident reporting\nand disclosure in a timely manner.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNotwithstanding our cybersecurity risk management and governance, we may not be successful in preventing or\nmitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While our business strategy,\nresults of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, we cannot provide assurance that\nthey will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more\ninformation regarding the cybersecurity risks we face, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nunder the caption “Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could\nharm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and\nsubject us to liability.”",

          "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2022 and\n2021 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nfiled with the SEC on February 16, 2023.\nOverview\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, media and entertainment\npromotional spending, and related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and\ntransaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote\ncontrols). Streaming services distribution was previously referred to as content distribution services.\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs (beginning in March 2023), smart\nhome products and services, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements\nwith service operators. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices of Roku streaming devices to\nincrease our Active Accounts. We expect that the trade off from devices gross profit or loss to grow Active\nAccounts will result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as part of our continuing evaluation of our operations, we\ndetermined to implement additional measures to continue to bring down our year-over-year operating expense growth\nrate by consolidating our office space utilization, performing a strategic review of our content portfolio,\nreducing outside services expenses, and slowing our year-over-year headcount expense growth rate through a series\nof workforce reductions and limiting new hires, among other measures. We recorded a total restructuring charge of\n$356.1 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of these actions. See Note 17 to the\nconsolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details.\nBusiness Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit\nmarket fluctuations, changes in economic policy, global supply chain constraints, and geopolitical developments\n(such as the war in Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle East), have had, and we believe may continue to have, an\nimpact on our business and results of operations. We believe that advertisers in a variety of industries reduce\ntheir overall advertising spend when they are impacted by these factors, which in turn adversely affects our\nplatform revenue. Higher inflation and economic uncertainty also lead to a reduction in consumer discretionary\nspending, which impacts our devices revenue. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business\nconditions and macroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Note\nRegarding Forward Looking Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details.\n53\nTable of Contents\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, Active Accounts, Streaming Hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nActive Accounts as they stream content on our platform. All of our gross profit is generated from our platform\nsegment.\nOur gross profit was $1,522.6 million and $1,441.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 6%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of Active Accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nActive Accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. Additionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not\nincluded in our reported number of Active Accounts. The number of Active Accounts also does not correspond to the\nnumber of unique individuals who actively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an\naccount. For example, an Active Account may include more than one individual, such as a family, and one Active\nAccount may include use of multiple Roku streaming devices.\nWe had 80.0 million and 70.0 million Active Accounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting an\nincrease of 14%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of Streaming Hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define Streaming Hours as the aggregate amount of time Roku streaming\ndevices stream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku\nplatforms are not included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our Streaming\nHours. We report Streaming Hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content partners is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming apps, and the number of Streaming Hours\ndoes not correlate to revenue earned from such content partners or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nStreaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming app may\ncontinue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming app. We believe that this also occurs\nacross a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to\nidentify when content has been continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user\ninteraction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm\nthat they are still watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not respond affirmatively. We\nbelieve that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, content\npartners, and advertisers. Some of our leading content partners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar\nfeatures within their apps. This Roku OS feature supplements these app features. This feature has not had and is\nnot expected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 106.0 billion and 87.4 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 21%.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of Active Accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our Active Accounts base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $39.92 as of December 31, 2023 as compared to $41.68 as of December 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease of 4%.\nThe decrease in ARPU is due to an increasing share of Active Accounts in international markets where we are\ncurrently focused on growing scale and engagement, rather than monetization of our streaming platform.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in\nThe Roku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well as ad inventory we obtain through\nour streaming services distribution agreements with our content partners. To supplement supply, we purchase\nadvertising inventory from our content partners, on an as needed basis. To date, we have generated most of our\nplatform revenue in the United States.\nDevices Revenue\nWe generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services,\naudio products, and related accessories. Our devices revenue also includes licensing arrangements with service\noperators. We generate most of our devices revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily\nsell our devices through wholesale distributors which, in turn, sell to retailers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Revenue, Platform\nCost of revenue, platform primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory and\namortization costs of content, both licensed and produced, and revenue share with content partners . Cost of\nrevenue, platform also includes other costs such as payment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the\ndelivery of our services that primarily include costs of third-party cloud services and salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our customer support and platform operations personnel, and amortization of acquired\ndeveloped technology.\nCost of Revenue, Devices\nCost of revenue, devices is comprised mostly of manufacturing costs payable to third party manufacturers for\ndevices we sell which include streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, audio products and smart home products. Cost of\nrevenue, devices also includes technology licenses or royalty fees on devices we sell, inbound and outbound\nfreight, duty and logistics costs, third-party packaging, inventory provisions, and allocated overhead costs\nrelated to facilities, third-party cloud services, customer support, and salaries, benefits, and stock-based\ncompensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\ndevelopment teams as well as outsourced development expenses. In addition, research and development expenses\ninclude allocated facilities and overhead expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, commissions, and stock-based compensation for\nour employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing, communications, data science and analytics, business\ndevelopment, product management, and partner support functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include\nmarketing, retail and merchandising expenses, and allocated facilities and overhead expenses.\n55\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\nfinance, legal, information technology, human resources, and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting, and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility and overhead expenses.\nOther Income, Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, other income, net consists of interest income on cash and cash\nequivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of services as part\nof a strategic commercial arrangement, i nter est expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization of\ndeferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement, transaction gains and losses, and net change in the fair\nvalue of the Strategic Investment (as defined in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report).\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct\nbusiness and income taxes in the United States. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,\nincluding net operating losses primarily for the U.S. and any jurisdiction where we do not expect to realize their\nbenefits in the future. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\n56\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023       2022       2021\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   86  %      87  %      82  %\nDevices                                                    14  %      13  %      18  %\nTotal net revenue                                         100  %     100  %     100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   41  %      38  %      30  %\nDevices                                                    15  %      16  %      19  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                      56  %      54  %      49  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                                                   45  %      49  %      52  %\nDevices                                                    -1  %      -3  %      -1  %\nTotal gross profit                                         44  %      46  %      51  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                   25  %      25  %      17  %\nSales and marketing                                        30  %      27  %      16  %\nGeneral and administrative                                 12  %      11  %       9  %\nTotal operating expenses                                   67  %      63  %      42  %\nIncome (Loss) from Operations                             -23  %     -17  %       9  %\nOther Income, Net:\nInterest expense                                            —  %       —  %       —  %\nOther income, net                                           3  %       1  %       —  %\nTotal other income, net                                     3  %       1  %       —  %\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes                         -20  %     -16  %       9  %\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                                —  %       —  %       —  %\nNet Income (Loss)                                         -20  %     -16  %       9  %\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nNet Revenue\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2023            2022       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 2,994,105    $  2,711,441    $   282,664          10  %\nDevices                                                   490,514         415,093         75,421          18  %\nTotal net revenue                     $                 3,484,619    $  3,126,534    $   358,085          11  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $282.7 million, or 10%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue from streaming services distribution, such as\nrevenue share on content subscriptions and Premium Subscriptions through The Roku Channel, which was offset by\nslightly lower revenue from advertising driven primarily by weakness in media and entertainment promotional\nspending.\n57\nTable of Contents\nDevices\nDevices revenue increased by $75.4 million, or 18%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022. $10.0 million of the increase was due to a change in estimated transaction price for a\nlicensing arrangement with a service operator for which performance obligations were satisfied in prior periods and\nwas recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The remaining increase was driven primarily\nby the sales of Roku-branded TVs introduced in March 2023 and to a lesser extent by the sales of smart home\nproducts, partially offset by lower revenue from sales of streaming players. The volume of streaming players sold\ndecreased by 8% and the average selling price of streaming players increased by 1% during the year ended December\n31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2023            2022       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,427,546    $  1,179,675    $   247,871          21  %\nDevices                                                   534,458         505,737         28,721           6  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,962,004    $  1,685,412    $   276,592          16  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,566,559    $  1,531,766    $    34,793           2  %\nDevices                                                   -43,944         -90,644         46,700         -52  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,522,615    $  1,441,122    $    81,493           6  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of revenue, platform increased by $247.9 million, or 21%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase of $182.4 million was primarily driven by higher costs\nof acquiring content, higher costs of Premium Subscriptions, and higher credit card processing fees, partially\noffset by lower content asset amortization and lower cost of advertising inventory. The cost of revenue, platform\nalso includes restructuring charges of $67.0 million of which $65.5 million consisted of impairment charges related\nto removing selected content assets from The Roku Channel.\nGross profit for the platform segment increased by $34.8 million, or 2%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the overall growth in our platform revenue.\nDevices\nThe cost of revenue, devices increased by $28.7 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher manufacturing costs of $8.7\nmillion, higher royalties of $8.6 million, higher inventory provision of $2.2 million, and higher other device\nrelated costs such as product warranties and overhead cost allocation of $9.3 million, offset by lower freight\ncosts of $3.5 million. The increase in manufacturing costs was driven primarily by the cost of Roku-branded TVs\nthat we began selling in March 2023 and the cost of smart home products. The cost of revenue, devices also includes\nrestructuring charges of $3.3 million that consist of employee severance, facilities exit costs, and asset\nimpairments.\nGross loss for the devices segment decreased by $46.7 million, or 52%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The gross loss was driven by a higher cost of manufacturing of\nproducts in the devices segment as compared to the revenue generated from them.

The increase was driven by the increases in foreign taxes primarily due to the increase of\ntaxable earnings in our foreign operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,025.9 million. Approximately 4% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses such as personnel-related expenses including\nemployee termination payments, consulting and professional service expenses, facility expenses, and marketing\nexpenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition\nactivities in the future, including the acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. Though we do not\nexpect to incur expenses for facilities and building related costs at the same level as the last few fiscal years,\nwe will continue to incur expenses on the maintenance of our facilities and purchases of computer systems, and\nother property and equipment, in order to support future growth in our business. These activities may materially\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital\nexpenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and\nbeyond. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be\naffected by various risks, uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in\nthis Annual Report and the effects of the current macroeconomic environment. While the current macroeconomic\nenvironment has not severely impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption\nand volatility in local economies and in capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and\ncapital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we\nraise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and\nalso to restrictive covenants. Additionally, due to the current macroeconomic environment, we may be unable to\nobtain debt or equity financing on terms that are acceptable to us.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provided for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nOn November 18, 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million from the Term Loan A Facility. We\nelected an interest rate equal to the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our\nsecured leverage ratio. The Credit Facility matured on February 19, 2023 and the outstanding Term Loan A Facility\nwas repaid in full.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit against the Revolving Credit Facility of $37.7\nmillion. Upon maturity of the Credit Facility on February 19, 2023, the outstanding letters of credit were secured\nby our existing cash balance, a portion of which is restricted for that purpose. As of December 31, 2023, we had\noutstanding letters of credit of $37.5 million, which are secured by restricted cash of $40.7 million.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details.\n60\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2023           2022\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   255,856    $    11,795\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                   -92,619    $  -201,696\nCash flows (used in) provided by           $                   -61,243    $     8,357\nfinancing activities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $255.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our net loss of\n$709.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $972.7 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization of property and\nequipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, impairment of assets as part of\nrestructuring charges, and change in fair value of the Strategic Investment.\nThe changes in our operating assets and liabilities used cash totaling $7.3 million mainly due to payments made to\nacquire content, payments made for operating leases liabilities, and an increase in the accounts receivable balance\nat the end of the year due to higher revenue, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due\nto timing of payments, an increase in deferred revenue, a decrease in prepaid expenses, and a decrease in inventory\nbalances at the end of fiscal 2023.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included cash outflows of $92.6 million consisting of\npurchases of property and equipment and expenditures related to the expansion of our office facilities of $82.6\nmillion and an additional investment in the Strategic Investment of $10.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities used cash of $61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The cash outflow related\nprimarily to the repayment of $80.0 million of our Credit Facility that became due in February 2023 offset by $18.8\nmillion received from proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of:\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our contract manufacturers and other inventory related items.\nConsistent with industry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with\nour contract manufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Our contract manufacturers source components and build our\nproducts based on these demand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our\nproducts may result in us being committed to purchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments. For additional\ninformation regarding manufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to license content from content partners and produce content under contractual arrangements. For\nadditional information regarding content commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item\n8 of this Annual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our restructuring efforts to\nconsolidate office space did not materially change our operating lease obligations.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $6.2 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\n61\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nJudgment may be required in determining whether products contain multiple distinct performance obligations and\nwhether each should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation\nbased on its relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Our process for determining SSP requires judgment. For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, we consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on prices\ncharged to customers for individual products, taking into consideration other factors, which may include (i)\nhistorical and expected discounting practices, (ii) the size, and volume of transactions, (iii) the geographic\nareas in which our products are sold, and (iv) our overall go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations\nthat are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen arrangements have variable consideration, we utilize the expected value method to estimate the amount expected\nto be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained to\nthe extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment of historical,\ncurrent, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nThe transaction price in some of our arrangements include non-cash consideration. We determine the fair value of\nnon-cash consideration at contract inception by using historical internal and observable third-party data.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price.\nAmortization of Content Assets\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected monetization of such\ncontent which results in accelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Judgment is\nrequired to determine the amortization patterns of our content assets which are monetized as a group. Critical\njudgments include: (i) the predominant monetization strategy of content, (ii) the grouping of content with similar\ncharacteristics, and (iii) the application of historical viewership model and projected decay. These judgments and\nunderlying analysis are reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed on a prospective basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nto which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances indicate an asset or asset group’s\ncarrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net\ncash flows directly associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group against their\nrespective carrying amounts. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\n62\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $131.6 million for operating lease\nright-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $72.3 million for property and equipment related to a decision to\nsub-lease and cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. The impairment was a\nresult of the restructuring efforts announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for additional\ndetails. There were no impairments of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nSignificant judgments and estimates included in the determination of the fair value of the assets were\nidentification of events or changes in circumstances necessitating an impairment assessment, the expected downtime\nprior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and\ndiscount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nOur accounts receivable is stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical\nexperience, promotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual\nresults, the losses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset\nand liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nIn determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess both positive and negative evidence in the various\njurisdictions to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are recoverable. We\nregularly assess all available evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings. A valuation\nallowance is established when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance for our U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty\nof realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. A change\nin the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period\nin which a change of assessment occurs. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S.\nfederal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release\nis recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements are discussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements\nin Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents. The\nprimary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly\nincreasing risk. We believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points on our cash and cash\nequivalents balance would impact our interest income by an additional increase or decrease of $20.7 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or\nother financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the\nfuture.\n63\nTable of Contents",

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination in Streaming Services Distribution – Refer to Note 2 to\nthe financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content partners, management is required to\nestimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to streaming services distribution.\nVariable consideration related to streaming services distribution (“content partner arrangements”) is included in\nthe estimated transaction price based on the expected value for which a significant reversal of revenue is not\nexpected to occur. For streaming services distribution, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the partner’s applications.\nWe identified the forecasts of variable consideration relating to streaming service distribution as a critical\naudit matter due to the significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required\na high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\n65\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to streaming services\ndistribution.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for streaming services distribution.\n◦ Tested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\n◦ Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\n◦ Tested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\n◦ We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to partners’ content applications\nas well as our observations and inquiries as to the changes within the business and considerations of macroeconomic\nand industry factors.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose,

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and\nprogrammatic video advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming\nservices distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions,\nand the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). Streaming services distribution was previously referred to\nas content distribution services. The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-\nbranded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from\nlicensing arrangements with service operators.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Certain prior period amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\namortization and the impairment of content assets;\nthe impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment;\nvaluation of the Strategic Investment (defined in Note 7);\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 includes foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or\nlosses from remeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 1.5million, a gain of $\n8.2million, and a loss of $ 1.2million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposit accounts\nand investments in money market funds.\nThe Company’s restricted cash balance is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and is used to secure outstanding letters of credit related to operating leases for office\nfacilities. The letters of credit were previously secured by the Credit Facility (defined in Note 10) which matured\nand was repaid in February 2023. See Note 10 for additional details.\nThe Company maintains its cash, cash equivalent, and restricted cash balances with high credit financial\ninstitutions and continuously monitors the amount of exposure to any one institution and diversifies as necessary\nin order to minimize its concentration risk. Such balances often exceed regulated insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nBeginning balance                    $                     7,417    $    6,015    $    5,912\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,560        19,068        16,181\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -16,169       -17,666       -16,078\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     7,808    $    7,417    $    6,015\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023           2022          2021\nBeginning balance                       $                    28,903    $    48,411    $   30,838\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      85,178         94,731        90,530\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                        -91,057       -114,239       -72,957\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    23,024    $    28,903    $   48,411\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023        2022         2021\nBeginning balance                         $                     3,498    $  2,158    $   4,181\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                          1,674       2,081         -904\naccounts\nAdjustments for write-off                                      -2,959        -741       -1,119\nEnding balance                            $                     2,213    $  3,498    $   2,158\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net\nbalance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment at least annually\nduring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill or\nindefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes\nin the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived-intangible asset is less than its carrying value. In performing\nits annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test for impairment or it can\ndirectly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s qualitative assessment, if it is determined that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets is, more likely than not, less than its\ncarrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount\nover its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. Any excess of an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying amount over its fair value is\nrecorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of an asset or asset\ngroup based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with their use and eventual\ndisposition. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess\nof the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported. The Company recorded an\nimpairment charge related to abandoned technology assets of $ 7.5million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThere were noimpairments of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2021. See\nNote 17 for additional details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 131.6million for\noperating lease right-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $ 72.3million for property and equipment related to\na decision to sub-lease and cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. This\naction was taken as part of the restructuring announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for\nadditional details. There were noimpairments of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nhistorical and projected viewing patterns. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be,\nabandoned are written off. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of\n$ 65.5million related to removing select licensed and produced content from The Roku Channel. This action was taken\nas part of the restructuring announced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. See Note 17 for additional\ndetails. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n75\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the\npromised goods or services in the contract which may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the\ninception of each arrangement, the Company evaluates the likelihood that the payments will be collected. When\narrangements have variable consideration, the Company utilizes the expected value method to estimate the amount\nexpected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is\nconstrained to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on prices charged to customers\nfor individual products in consideration with historical and expected discounting practices, the size, and volume\nof transactions, geographic location, and go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations that are not\nroutinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen the Company’s arrangements involve third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the\nprincipal, and reports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this\nassessment, the Company considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies or third-party demand\nand supply-side platforms and to content partners for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign\ntools. Advertising arrangements include video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions.\nAdvertising arrangements include multiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or\nservices. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on\ntheir relative SSP. The Company also generates revenue from customers using its advertising platform. For such\narrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is a percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during\nthe month, along with data and any add-on features purchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue\non either a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the\nprincipal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being\nprimarily responsible to its customers for the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing\npricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of multiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in\ntime or over time depending on the nature of the distinct performance obligation.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s revenue sharing arrangements within its streaming services distribution include cash or non-cash\nconsideration. The revenue sharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for\nnew services and at the time of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is\ndeemed to be the agent between content partners and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by\nday, as the services are delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the\nform of advertising inventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party\ndata.\nThe Company sells Premium Subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded app buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to a\ncontent partner’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service\noperators.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the unspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a\ntime elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to service operators. The revenue allocated to\nunspecified upgrades and updates is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nProfessional services revenue is recognized as services are provided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a\ntime elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\n77\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on its assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto eleven years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did notcapitalize any internal-use software\ndevelopment costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company capitalized internal-use software\ndevelopment costs of $ 0.5million. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of the asset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its\nintended use. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company amortized internal-use software\ndevelopment costs of $ 0.9million, $ 1.0million, and $ 1.0million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers, content partners, and\nlicensing or services fees received from service operators and TV brands, where performance obligations are not yet\nfulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and the\nremaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 3.7million, $ 10.0million,\nand $ 35.2million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatility of the Company’s\nClass A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar in size\nand/or operational and economic activities.\n78\nTable of Contents\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of the Company’s stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , that requires companies\nto provide enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses within its reportable segment disclosures on an\nannual and interim basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance applies retrospectively to all prior\nperiods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of\nthe new guidance.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ,\nthat requires incremental disclosures within the income tax disclosures that increase the transparency and\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The updated disclosures primarily require specific categories and greater\ndisaggregation within the rate reconciliation, disaggregation of income taxes paid, and modifying other income tax-\nrelated disclosures. The guidance is effective either prospectively or retrospectively for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of the new guidance.\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is represented by the tworeportable segments discussed in Note 16.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             816,337    $  760,793    $  752,393\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                    17,964        42,617        46,952\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                      102,157        87,678        45,760\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   24,572        28,210        28,726\nTotal deferred revenue                   $             126,729    $  115,888    $   74,486\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for sales returns, sales incentives,\nand doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 24.7million during the year\nended December 31, 2023 due to the timing of billing to customers and a slower growth rate in platform revenue.\nContract assets decreased by $ 4.3million during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the timing of billing to\ncustomers and a slower growth rate in platform revenue.\n79\nTable of Contents\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 10.8million during the year ended December 31, 2023 due\nto an increase in subscription revenue related to Premium Subscriptions and smart home products, higher device\nrevenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and due to the\nbillings in excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to platform\nrevenue arrangements. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 41.4million during the year ended December 31,\n2022 primarily due to the billings in excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance\nobligations related to revenue arrangements.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2022 was $ 88.4million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $ 47.6million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 1,195.9million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 47% over the next 12months and the\nremainder thereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 45.5million and reversed $ 3.2million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in\nthe estimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nCustomer I accounted for 11% of the total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company did not\nhave any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its total net revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\n4. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration in a business combination over the fair value of tangible\nand intangible assets acquired net of the liabilities assumed. All goodwill relates to the platform segment.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. Noimpairment was recognized during the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s intangible assets for the periods presented (in thousands, except\nyears):\nAs of December 31,\n2023\nGross        Accumulated            Net    Weighted-Average\nCarrying       Amortization       Carrying    Useful Lives\nAmount                            Amount    (in years)\nDeveloped              $                 73,367    $       -49,087    $    24,280                           5.9\ntechnology\nCustomer                                 14,100            -13,948            152                           4.0\nrelationships\nTradename                                20,400             -5,966         14,434                           9.8\nPatents                                   4,076             -1,189          2,887                          14.0\nTotal Intangible       $                111,943    $       -70,190    $    41,753                           6.7\nassets\nAs of December 31,\n2022\nGross        Accumulated            Net    Weighted-Average\nCarrying       Amortization       Carrying    Useful Lives\nAmount                            Amount    (in years)\nDeveloped              $                 73,367    $       -37,278    $    36,089                           5.9\ntechnology\nCustomer                                 14,100            -10,920          3,180                           4.0\nrelationships\nTradename                                20,400             -3,966         16,434                           9.8\nPatents                                   4,076               -898          3,178                          14.0\nTotal Intangible       $                111,943    $       -53,062    $    58,881                           6.7\nassets\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as part of its\nrestructuring efforts related to the abandonment of future development of certain technology assets.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $ 1,431.4million and $\n608.4million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company measured the Strategic Investment using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the\nStrategic Investment on the date of purchase was determined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company\nrecorded an unrealized gain of $ 4.3million and an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income, net related to\nthe change in the fair value of the Strategic Investment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe Company classified the Strategic Investment as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over\nfair value inputs. The fair value of the Strategic Investment was estimated using a scenario-based probability\nweighted discounted cash flow model. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and\nprobability weighting of the various redemption scenarios that impact the settlement of the Strategic Investment.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $ 269.4million that\nincluded $ 131.6million of operating lease right-of-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment\nimpairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets impairment related to removing select licensed and produced content\nfrom The Roku Channel.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the\nabandonment of future development of certain technology assets. The Company did notrecord any impairment charges\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe fair value of the impaired operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models, or the income approach, based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs.\nThe significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement\nof future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect\nthe level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows. For the licensed and produced content that was\nremoved from The Roku Channel, the net carrying amount of the content assets was written off.

No additional equity grants have been made pursuant to the 2008 Plan subsequent to the IPO.\nThe equity granted under the 2017 Plan is subject to continuous service. Stock options granted under the 2017 Plan\ngenerally are granted at a price per share equivalent to the fair market value on the date of grant.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 131.5million of non-cancelable purchase commitments for\ninventory.\nContent Commitments\nThe Company enters into contracts with content partners to license and produce content for streaming. When a title\nbecomes available, the Company records a content asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain\nlicensing agreements, such as film output deals, include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles\nfor which the ultimate quantity and/or fees are not determinable as of the reporting date. The Company does not\ninclude any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. The unknown obligations\ncould be material. The Company also licenses content under arrangements where the payments are variable and based\non the revenue earned by the Company. Since those amounts cannot be determined, they are not included in the\nobligations below.\n89\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s total obligation for licensed and produced content is $ 286.1million, of\nwhich the Company recorded $ 59.2million in Current liabilities and $ 24.1million in Other long-term liabilities in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $ 202.8million is not yet recognized on the consolidated balance\nsheets as the content does not meet the criteria for asset recognition.\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,\n2024                            184,716\n2025                             62,655\n2026                             21,971\n2027                             12,732\n2028                              1,436\nThereafter                        2,568\nTotal content liabilities    $  286,078\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\n37.5million and $ 37.7million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various\nexpiration dates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accounts for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing and other\nclaims, when it believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These contingencies are reviewed at\nleast quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal\nproceedings can be, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices, and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in proceedings, claims and investigations not listed herein. Although the results of these\nproceedings, claims, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the\nfinal outcome of any matters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any loss contingencies that were material.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n90\nTable of Contents\n13.

Due to\nthis required capitalization of research and development expenses, the Company has recorded U.S. current income tax\nexpense of $ 3.7million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized through future operations. As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2023, the Company believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 166.0million and $ 199.2million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is primarily\nattributable to an increase in deferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and\ndevelopment expenses for U.S. federal and conforming state purposes.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,807.3million and $ 1,604.0million are available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2037, and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2023.\nFor Brazil, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n8.6million, $ 47.6million, and $ 14.0million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable income, if any.\nBrazil and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be\ncarried back one year and carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 194.7million and $\n149.5million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2030 and 2039, respectively.\n92\nTable of Contents\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 is $ 88.5million, of which $ 71.8million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 16.7million is related to international activities.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023         2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              88,028    $  66,150\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        13,166       22,888\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                      -54         -317\nGross increase for tax positions of                           140          676\nprior years\nGross decrease for tax positions of                       -12,689       -1,185\nprior years\nDecrease relating to settlements with                         -43         -184\ntaxing authorities\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              88,548    $  88,028\nof year\nAs of December 31, 2023, $ 5.2million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate and $ 83.3million would result in an adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding\nadjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 1.0million and $ 0.8million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and certain\nforeign jurisdictions. All tax years remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits\ninclude questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and\ncompliance with federal, state, and local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Act, the Company has not\nprovided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, state income tax or\nforeign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of unrecognized tax\nexpense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. NoCompany contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nThe Company has defined contribution plans in the U.K. and Korea for the employees in those countries. The Company\ncontributed $ 3.2million, $ 2.3million, and $ 1.3million in total to these plans for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n93\nTable of Contents\n15. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock and\nrestricted stock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by\napplying the treasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\nshare in the period of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                         2023                    2022                   2021\nNet income (loss)           $                  -709,561             $  -498,005             $  242,385\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                132,710\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per       $                     -5.01             $     -3.62             $     1.83\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income\n(loss) per share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                132,710\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                —                       —                  2,744\nStock options                                         —                       —                  6,214\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                   141,572                 137,668                141,668\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per       $                     -5.01             $     -3.62             $     1.71\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect were 14.0million, 14.4million and 1.1million units of equity awards to purchase common stock\ngranted under the Company’s equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n94\nTable of Contents\n16. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nDescriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue is generated from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, media and entertainment promotional spending, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nDevices\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories as well as revenue from licensing arrangements with service\noperators.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023       2022       2021\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                            *          *      10  %\nCustomer I                                        13  %          *          *\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        15  %          *          *\nCustomer B                                        15  %      21  %      22  %\nCustomer C                                        41  %      38  %      35  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023          2022\nUnited States      $             497,024    $  686,902\nUnited Kingdom                   109,315       127,538\nOther countries                   29,661        42,286\nTotal              $             636,000    $  856,726\n95\nTable of Contents\n17. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nThe Company began efforts to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic conditions in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2022. The Company recorded employee termination expenses, and an impairment charge related to\nabandoned technology assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company implemented additional measures including consolidating its\noffice space utilization, performing a strategic review of its content portfolio, reducing outside services\nexpenses, and slowing its year-over-year headcount expense growth rate through a workforce reduction and limiting\nnew hires, among other measures. As a result of these measures, the Company recorded restructuring charges\nassociated with employee termination expenses consisting primarily of severance payments, employee benefits\ncontributions, payroll taxes and related costs, impairment charges related to decisions to sub-lease and cease the\nuse of certain office facilities and related property and equipment, and impairment charges related to removing\nselect licensed and produced content from The Roku Channel.\nThe restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear                                                         Year\nEnded                                                        Ended\nDecember                                                     December\n31,                                                          31,\n2023                                                         2022\nEmployee       Faciliti…          Asset                      Employee          Asset\nTermina…            Exit       Impairm…         Total       Terminat…       Impairm…        Total\nCosts        Charges                                      Charges\nCost of\nrevenu…    $     1,164    $          1    $    65,867    $   67,032    $          —    $         —    $       —\nplatfo…\nCost of\nrevenu…            524               6          2,793         3,323               —              —            —\ndevices\nResear…\nand             31,160           1,320         78,011       110,491          12,092          7,500       19,592\ndevelo…\nSales\nand             29,786             517         83,411       113,714          10,904              —       10,904\nmarket…\nGeneral\nand             20,531           1,683         39,320        61,534           7,644              —        7,644\nadmini…\nTotal\nrestru…    $    83,165    $      3,527    $   269,402    $  356,094    $     30,640    $     7,500    $  38,140\ncharges\nThe asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2023 include $ 131.6million of operating lease right-\nof-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment impairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets\nimpairment.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nherein.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n97\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2024\n98\nTable of Contents",
