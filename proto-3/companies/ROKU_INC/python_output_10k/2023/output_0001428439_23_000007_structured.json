          "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” “the Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nMexico, and Canada by hours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV. We believe that all TV content and all TV advertising will be streamed. The shift\nof the TV ecosystem to streaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers, and other industry participants. TV streaming is now mainstream. In 2022, for the first time viewers\nin the United States spent more TV time streaming than watching cable, and “cutting the cord” from traditional TV\nservices has accelerated. Essentially every major media company has entered TV streaming and launched a streaming\nservice, with several expanding beyond pure subscription models to new ad-supported options. Similarly, advertisers\ncan use TV streaming to reach consumers that are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV while also benefiting\nfrom the digital advertising capabilities that TV streaming platforms deliver.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nconsumers, content publishers, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect consumers to the\nentertainment they love, enable content publishers to build, engage, and monetize large audiences, and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach consumers. The foundation of our platform is the Roku operating\nsystem (the “Roku OS”), which is purpose built for TV streaming.\nThe Roku OS powers our Roku streaming devices. Roku streaming devices include Roku streaming players, Roku\nStreambars, and TVs powered by Roku OS (which include TVs that are manufactured and sold by our licensed Roku TV\npartners (“Roku TV models”) and our own TVs that will be available to purchase beginning in 2023 (“Roku-branded\nTVs”)). We license the Roku OS to our licensed Roku TV partners who leverage our smart TV reference designs, and\nthen manufacture and sell Roku TV models. In January 2023, we announced the launch of Roku Select and Roku Plus\nSeries TVs, a new line of Roku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us, which will also be powered\nby the Roku OS. The Roku OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware which enables us and our licensed Roku TV\npartners to sell streaming players and TVs at affordable prices. Consumers connect their Roku streaming devices to\nour streaming platform via a broadband network and are able to access a wide selection of content through a\nstreaming experience that is both delightful and easy to use.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to serve content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, and other industry participants. Content publishers can reach our highly-\nengaged user base of 70.0 million active accounts and use our billing services and data insight tools. Advertisers\nreach TV viewers at scale with targeted and measurable ads. Licensed Roku TV partners can build market share by\noffering smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-rated\nstreaming devices online and in stores. We continue to focus significant resources to advance the Roku OS; to\nprovide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; to obtain content for\nour platform that attracts users, including our own original content; and to extend Roku’s advantage as the global\nshift to TV streaming continues.\nIn 2022, we extended our ecosystem and launched new smart home products to build new service revenue streams. Our\nsmart home product offering includes cameras, video doorbells, plugs, light bulbs, and light strips, along with a\nRoku Smart Home mobile app for iOS and Android. We offer subscription plans for our cameras and video doorbells\nthat provide users with the ability to view cloud recordings of the videos and to receive AI-based alerts (e.g.,\nperson, package, vehicle, pet). One of our smart home priorities is interoperability, and Roku Smart Home is\ncompatible with Google Home, Alexa, and Roku Voice. The Roku video doorbells and cameras also integrate with the\nRoku OS, allowing users to view live video streams and receive real-time notifications directly on their TVs. The\nproducts are available on our website at Roku.com and in-store exclusively at Walmart, America’s #1 retailer, in\nnearly 3,500 locations where Roku is the #1 smart home brand by shelf space. Similar to our TV streaming business\nmodel, we plan to build scale with these devices and then monetize through smart home services.\n5\nTable o f Contents\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we grow scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we grow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we grow\nmonetization of the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is\ndesigned to fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, other device licensees, and retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable in part by offering a broad lineup of streaming players, at various price\npoints, that customers can use to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. Audio is an important part of the TV\nstreaming experience, and we also offer the Roku Streambar (a soundbar with a built-in streaming player), Roku\nwireless speakers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by Roku OS, and Roku Wireless Subwoofers. Additionally, we\noffer customers the choice to build an audio experience with third-party products through The Roku TV Ready\nprogram. Through this partnership with audio companies, we enable their audio products to work seamlessly with TVs\npowered by Roku OS. On a periodic basis, we launch new streaming players and provide updates via the Roku OS to\ncontinuously offer an exceptional TV streaming experience with the highest performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS to licensed Roku TV partners that manufacture and sell Roku TV models that integrate\nthe Roku OS to enable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong active\naccount growth through our Roku TV licensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low\nhardware costs, enabling these TV brand licensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced\nfor consumers and that are automatically updated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\nWe also recently announced the launch of a new line of Roku-branded TVs (the Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs)\nthat will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023. These TVs will complement our successful Roku TV licensing\nprogram. We believe our Roku-branded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position and expand into the\nhigher-end spectrum of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of\nhardware and software and test directly with consumers, improving the product and consumer experience and\nstrengthening the entire Roku TV ecosystem.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nplayers to their subscribers in their markets.\nThrough the Roku platform, we provide consumers tremendous choice, value, and an exceptional user experience. We\nhave been able to significantly scale our active account base over a multi-year period. In 2022, we added 9.9\nmillion net new active accounts, ending the year with 70.0 million active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content and an easy-to-use interface drives increased engagement by\ndelivering a better overall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform grew from 73.2 billion hours in\n2021 to 87.4 billion hours in 2022, as our active accounts grew through the distribution of Roku streaming devices.\nThrough our streaming platform, we make it easy for our users to watch their favorite TV shows and movies, as well\nas listen to their favorite music and podcasts. Furthermore, we believe our platform offers users an exceptional TV\nstreaming experience through a user interface that is delightful and easy to use. From the Roku home screen, our\nusers can easily find and access TV shows, movies, news, sports, and more across a wide variety of channels\navailable on our streaming platform. In 2022, we added Live TV and What to Watch features to the Roku Home Screen\nMenu to make it even easier for viewers to quickly find the content they want. We also launched an all-new Sports\nexperience that gives consumers easy access to live and upcoming sports across the Roku platform from a centralized\nlocation. And Roku’s powerful universal search makes it fast and easy for users to find the content they are\nlooking for — regardless of the channel it is on. Additionally, users have choice in how much they want to spend on\ncontent through a broad array of options on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct\nrelationship with our users provides us with detailed insights about their behavior on our platform, including\ncertain content they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they\npurchase or subscribe to on our platform. This first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as\ncontent recommendations to improve our users’ experience.\n6\nTable o f Contents\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged streamers, tools that enable seamless sign ups (like Roku\nPay), and marketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content publishers. They can also reach\nthose users who no longer use or never used traditional TV services. As consumers shift to TV streaming, content\npublishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users directly.\nThe Roku Channel is our owned and operated streaming channel that drives engagement on our platform by providing\nusers with free, ad-supported access to a large and broad library of content. This content is available both on\ndemand and through more than 350 linear channels — all accessible from a single app on our platform. The Roku\nChannel also offers paid, subscription-based content from dozens of content partners through Premium Subscriptions,\nwhich gives users the ability to browse content before signing up, obtain free trials for subscriptions, sign up in\none-click, and enjoy simple subscription management with a single monthly bill. In 2022, The Roku Channel was a top\n5 channel on our platform in the U.S. by both Active Account Reach and Streaming Hour engagement.\nThe Roku Channel is a core strategic asset that simultaneously benefits consumers, content partners, and\nadvertisers, while generating increasing platform revenue. For viewers, The Roku Channel is a compelling\ndestination for a diverse selection of free and paid entertainment, providing content through linear channels and\non demand offerings. For content owners, The Roku Channel provides a variety of options to distribute and monetize\ncontent through both licensing agreements and Premium Subscriptions. And for both content owners and advertisers,\nThe Roku Channel delivers a large and engaged audience at scale that we believe will continue to grow. Owning and\noperating both The Roku Channel and the Roku platform creates unique value, making us a leader in free content,\npositioning us to be a valuable partner to content owners, and providing a large source of ad inventory.\nOur strategy for The Roku Channel is to drive engagement through a broad portfolio of quality content consisting of\nTV shows, movies, news, sports, lifestyle, and more in both on demand and linear channel formats. The foundation of\nour content strategy is revenue share and fixed licensing agreements and, to a smaller extent, original\nprogramming. We launched our original programming, “Roku Originals” on The Roku Channel in 2021 and have continued\nto build upon this library as it offers compelling, exclusive value to both consumers and advertisers. Our content\nspend is intended to be commensurate with the growth trajectory of The Roku Channel and also the broader macro\nenvironment.\nThe Roku Channel is available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and in 2022, we launched The\nRoku Channel in Mexico. In the United States, The Roku Channel features a diverse lineup of more than 80,000 free\nmovies and TV shows, including original and exclusive content, 350+ free linear television channels, free ad-\nsupported entertainment for kids and family with more than 10,000 titles, and more than 50 premium subscription\nchannels.\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe generate platform revenue primarily through advertising and content distribution services. Our sophisticated and\nleading TV streaming platform enables advertisers and content publishers to reach audiences that are increasingly\nunreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our platform creates multiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether\nthey are opening the Roku home page, enjoying ad-supported content, purchasing content, or simply using a Roku\nremote. We monetize our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and capabilities, including\nsales of subscription or transaction-based content, billing services, brand sponsorship and promotions, and video\nadvertising in ad-supported channels. We believe that running relevant display and video ads enhances the user\nexperience on our platform. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per user\n(“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and gross profit. ARPU (which we\nmeasure on a trailing 12-month basis) was $41.68 as of December 31, 2022 compared to $40.67 as of December 31,\n2021. Our gross profit was $1,441.1 million and $1,408.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.\nWe make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\nchannels and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported, which\nincludes advertising video on demand (“AVOD”) channels with on demand content that do not charge a subscription fee\nto users, as well as free ad-supported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear\nstreaming TV; and transaction video on demand (“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte content\npurchases or rentals. Through Roku Pay, our proprietary platform billing solution, we are also able to assist\ncontent partners with billing services, including billing users for in-channel purchases like content rentals,\nmanaging subscriptions, and customer invoices. Roku Pay allows publishers to enable a frictionless, “one-click”\nsignup within the app, and we believe this key benefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and\nretention for our content publishers.\n7\nTable o f Contents\nContent publishers also have access to our media and entertainment promotional capabilities and tools to help them\nattract, engage, and retain viewers by investing in promoting their content to our users on our platform. Content\npublishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on the Roku home screen or a screen\nsaver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic to their channels in order to\ndrive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive revenue from the sale of branded channel\nbuttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase incremental usage of the\nchannel by allowing users to launch straight into the channel from any screen. Our analytics and reporting assist\ncontent publishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles. Using machine learning, we\nalso can help content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of\ntools to reach consumers both on and off the Roku platform. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination of our\nsignificant scale, our direct relationship with our users, and our advertising capabilities to serve relevant\nadvertisements. Advertisers on our platform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their\nreturn on investment.\nOneView is our ad buying platform built for TV streaming. Advertisers use OneView to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own. In a world where all TV ads will be automated and streamed, our\nsoftware and machine learning provide the best way to reach a Roku user wherever they are — on the Roku platform,\nother TV streaming devices, desktop, mobile, and more. Advertisers choose OneView because it is the only ad buying\nplatform with Roku data, ad inventory from The Roku Channel, and new Roku ad experiences that go beyond the\ntraditional TV ad spot.\nWe offer engagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We\nwork with a wide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and\naudience demographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform.\nFurthermore, we have relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data,\nwhich enables our advertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on\ntraditional TV. Additional promotional advertising opportunities include shoppable ads that allow consumers to buy\nproducts right from the TV screen and content sponsorships that give users the opportunity to experience a free\nmovie or show and sponsored themes in our user experience.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our platform and increase the value we deliver to our\nusers, content publishers, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our platform to meet evolving\nconsumer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must provide content\npublishers with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to innovate and\ninvest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental advertising\nspend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to continue investing in our business to enhance our competitive\ndifferentiation and drive future growth, but we also plan to continue to improve our operations and operating\nexpense profile to better manage through the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, we expect our\noperating expense year-over-year growth to significantly decline over the course of 2023. In particular, these\ninvestments will include research and development initiatives to bring new features and technology to our platform;\nsales and marketing efforts to drive increased scale and engagement of our user base; continued investment in both\nlicensed and original content to drive scale and engagement of The Roku Channel; and building out our general and\nadministrative infrastructure to support a global business.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate and launch new ad products. In 2022, we launched Roku’s Advertising Watermark, an industry-\nfirst capability which enables content publishers, advertisers, and technology providers to validate the\nauthenticity of videos ads on the Roku platform. In partnership with Walmart, we launched a product called\nShoppable Ads, which make shopping on TV streaming as easy as it is on social media. Viewers simply press “OK” with\ntheir Roku remote on a shoppable ad and proceed to checkout with their shipping and payment details pre-populated\nfrom Roku Pay. We also announced an industry-first collaboration with Microsoft that will quantify how TV\nadvertising on both traditional TV and TV streaming affects online searches to help marketers measure performance.\nWe launched Nielsen Total Ad Ratings, which provides media measurement across TV streaming, traditional TV,\ndesktop, and mobile. OneView was the first demand-side ad platform to directly integrate with Nielsen’s measurement\nsolution.\n8\nTable o f Contents\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers consumers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to consumers, content\npublishers, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, other device licensees, and retailers is as compelling in\ninternational markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku streaming devices are available in 20+ countries.\nWe are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States, Mexico, and Canada by hours streamed. We continue to\nbuild our foundation for international expansion by establishing teams and offices around the world and investing\nin systems and processes that will support international expansion going forward. In 2022, licensed Roku TV\npartners launched new Roku TV models in Mexico, Canada, and Germany, and we expanded into Australia with Roku TV\nmodels. In international markets, we will continue to focus on building scale first, increasing customer\nengagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive active account growth,\nengagement, and monetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities\nare primarily focused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands,\nretailers, and service operators, and driving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to\nconsumers through retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and service\noperators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform to\nincrease effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns.\nOur relationship with content publishers is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content relationship\nmanagement team, we enter into agreements with content publishers to distribute their app(s) on our platform, or\nlicense their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD channels, we\ntypically secure direct access to the content publishers’ video ad inventory for our monetization, and our sales\nefforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content publishers. Whereas our publishers typically\nfeature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large streaming audience across many\nchannels at once using our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their\ngoals across numerous key performance indicators. We are also developing relationships with more third-party\nplatforms (e.g., retail media networks, demand side platforms, and other strategic partners) to reach marketers\nbuying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create demand opportunities for Roku ad inventory. Our\nsales teams and products are organized into groups that specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency\nholding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content publishers\nand entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local\nadvertising. In addition, we work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of\nRoku TV models, including development, planning, manufacturing, and marketing.\nIn the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website (excluding Roku TV models). We\nalso sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon and Walmart collectively accounted\nfor 59% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 57% of our devices revenue for the year\nended December 31, 2021. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and work closely with these\nretailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to continue to invest\nsignificant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage\nof the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during\nholiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nactive accounts, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the fourth\nquarter.\n9\nTable o f Contents\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content publishers,\nadvertisers, licensed Roku TV partners, and service operators to understand their current and future needs. We have\ndesigned a product development process that captures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user\nfeedback in the development of new features and enhancements to the Roku platform. We intend to continue to\nsignificantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and enhance our platform and\ncapabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. All\nof our products are manufactured in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia, and Brazil. Our contracts do\nnot obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific price. Our manufacturers\nprocure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish based upon historical trends and\nanalysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The manufacturers ship our products to our\nthird-party warehouses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil where we ship our products\ndirectly to retailers, wholesale distributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprivacy protections and the security of online services. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are\nconsidering, legislation to govern consumer privacy; the U.S. Congress also is considering comprehensive federal\nprivacy legislation. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose different, and sometimes more\nstringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer privacy laws are constantly\nchanging and may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and costs associated with\ncomplying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit the ability of advertisers to fully\nutilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nTo the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of content over the internet, such operators\nmay seek to extract fees from us or our content publishers to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in\nblocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact\nour business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\n10\nTable o f Contents\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,000 issued patents and 500 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our active accounts, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content\nstreamed through our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that consumers engage in through our\nplatform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising mediums;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer smart home products that compete with our new smart home products and services; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top talent\nin engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,600 full-time employees located in 14 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to ensure\nthat Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\n11\nTable o f Contents\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. Since 2020, the launch of our formal diversity,\nequity, and inclusion (“DEI”) strategy, we have made considerable progress on elevating awareness of DEI, promoting\ndialogue and empathy, implementing employee resource groups, and expanding representation on The Roku Channel and\nthe Roku platform.\nOur Vice President of Global Talent Management and Inclusion leads our growing Inclusion Strategy team with a\ndirector of DEI and two program managers. We also have full-time resources embedded in our Talent Acquisition team.\nThey partner across Roku to advance DEI across our employee experience, recruiting, and customer experience. These\nareas comprise our three-part DEI framework: Inclusive Employee Experience, Inclusive Recruiting, and Inclusive\nCustomer Experience.\nInclusive Employee Experience : We facilitate an inclusive employee experience through our pay equity analysis,\nlearning and development offerings, internal and external communications, employee resource groups (“ERG”), and\nmentoring. In 2022, we continued our U.S. pay equity analysis to help ensure we pay fairly and equitably across\ngender and ethnicity, year over year. Our six voluntary and employee-led ERGs are highly engaged and foster a\ndiverse and inclusive workplace, build internal community, encourage career growth and networking, and support\nsocial impact partnerships. In 2022, we delivered a significant rollout of DEI offerings in the areas of bias,\ninclusive conversations, allyship, and subtle acts of exclusion. We also increased the frequency of DEI\ncommunications to amplify our commitment, both internally and externally.\nInclusive Recruiting : Our Inclusive Recruiting Program Manager and DEI specialists embedded within our Talent\nAcquisition team directly contribute to our efforts to be inclusive. In addition, every member of our Talent\nAcquisition team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit candidates from different backgrounds. To that\nend, all recruiters are equipped to discuss DEI best practices with hiring managers to ensure we continue to widen\nthe candidate pipeline for all roles and create inclusive recruiting experiences. Furthermore, our U.S. university\nrecruiting and intern programs embed DEI into their strategies so that our recruiting pipelines include\nhistorically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and underrepresented clubs and\nprograms across other schools where we recruit.\nOur external relationships are also focused on organizations that reflect underrepresented communities, including\ntechnical and non-technical women and underrepresented minority organizations, to enable our hiring managers and\nrecruiters to attend or speak at related conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story\nto a wider audience.\nInclusive Customer Experience : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our\ncustomer experiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. We offer a slate of “inclusion zones”\n(including Black Voices, Pride, Latino Voices, Women’s Voices, and Asian and Pacific Islander Voices) on the Roku\nplatform that highlight and celebrate related stories from various content providers.\nCommunity Engagement and Social Impact\nWe have developed a Social Impact program that engages our local communities through employee volunteerism. Our\nprogram partners with organizations that provide opportunities for employees to mentor high school students through\nactivities such as career panels, industry masterclasses, and hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math\n(STEM) challenges.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase our new hires’\nspeed to productivity. In addition to mandatory training covering anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, and\nprivacy, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged training offerings covering topics such as high-\nperformance feedback, active listening, and communication and presentation skills. Managers are provided with\ntraining on expectations for managers, interviewing and hiring, and performance management to support new and newly\npromoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical\nand non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase,\nand custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\n12\nTable o f Contents\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them if they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nGenerally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offering\nspecific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees. We generally do not pay cash\nbonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions) or have performance-based equity awards because\nour employees are expected to work at the highest level regardless of possible bonus payouts or awards.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

industry is highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content\nowners and aggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to\ndifferentiate ourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and\nretain users and our business will be harmed.\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and\nretaining users on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need\nto be able to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to\nthe content they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the\nfeatures and functionality of our streaming platform for users, content publishers, and advertisers. We also must\neffectively support popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime\nVideo, Disney+, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in the TV\nstreaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku\nstreaming devices. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart\nTVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into\nsmart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have greater financial resources than we do and can\nsubsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements in order to promote their other products\nand services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, and increase streaming\nhours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or\nthat provide a better streaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands\nthrough advertising than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast, offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing consumer\nbases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to Roku streaming devices, we\nmay not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours, revenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe also compete for streaming hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue and gross profit, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our platform or our other\nproducts to gain or maintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading\nTV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and\nsupport, and device distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards and unknown future developments\nmay require further investments in the development of Roku streaming devices, our platform and our other products.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive\nposition. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger\ncustomer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which\nprovide them with advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they\nmay be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion,\nsales, and distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products\nbetter than we can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or\nstandards and may be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our\nsales volume, revenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and\notherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer audio products, including Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers,\nand Roku wireless subwoofers, and Roku smart home products, including indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells,\nsmart lighting, and smart plugs. As a result, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio speakers\nand soundbars and other TV peripheral devices, as well as makers of other smart home products. If these products do\nnot operate as designed or do not enhance the TVs powered by Roku OS or other viewing experiences as we intend, our\nusers’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may impact the overall demand for our products and\nour partners’ Roku TV models.\n16\nTable o f Contents\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of over-the-top (“OTT”) advertising and OTT advertising\nplatforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including social media and other digital platforms, as well as traditional media,\nsuch as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content\nand other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. For example, Netflix and Disney+ recently launched ad-supported tiers in their streaming services,\nwhich may further increase competition for streaming advertising revenue. If we are unable to increase our revenue\nfrom advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to further optimize and\nmeasure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory, and expanding our advertising sales team and\nprogrammatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be harmed. We may not be able to compete\neffectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue\nand would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as traditional TV, radio, and print, and to advertising through social media and other digital platforms. The\nfuture growth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising and on advertisers increasing their spending\non advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers have shown growing interest in OTT advertising,\nwe cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to traditional TV\nadvertising or shift their advertising spending to social media and other digital platforms (rather than to us). In\naddition, if we are unable to compete with social media and other digital platforms to win business from\nadvertisers and agencies who have traditionally advertised on these platforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small\nor medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be limited. If advertisers, or their agency\nrelationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we\nexpect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political pressure in some countries to limit OTT advertising (including limiting the advertising\nthat may be shown to viewers of children’s content) or impose local content requirements on OTT services, which\ncould pose a threat to our services.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising and related services, and content\ndistribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional\nspending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls). As such,\nwe are seeking to expand the number of active accounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed across\nour platform in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as we\nincrease the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our expanding\nuser base and streaming activity. The total number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with platform\nrevenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or every user on our\nplatform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming\ncontent, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is connected to a TV, and the\nviewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular\nstreaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe\nthat this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes. Since the first\nquarter of 2020, all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has been\ncontinuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature\nperiodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel\nif the user does not respond affirmatively. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nsimilar features within their channels.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect viewing data or to\nprovide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to collect data\nregarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our legal\nobligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data\nfrom many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users.\n17\nTable o f Contents\nOther channels available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their channels by allowing users to purchase additional content\nand streaming services within their channels; when users purchase these additional services within these channels,\nwe may earn less revenue than when the services are purchased directly from us. If our users spend most of their\ntime within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant\nadvertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit.\nAdditionally, our distribution agreements with our most popular channels are renegotiated periodically; thus, even\nif we are currently able to monetize streaming hours within a channel, we may not be able to do so in the future.\nIf we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not\ncontinue to grow as we expect, and our platform revenue growth has been, and may continue to be, lower than\nexpected due to advertisers significantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to inflationary pressures,\nrecessionary fears or other reasons that are out of our control. In addition, advertisers’ spending commitments,\nsuch as those we obtain in connection with annual TV Upfront presentations, are typically not fully binding, and\nthe revenue we receive from such commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. This means that in\norder to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we\nwill need to attract significantly more advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-\nsupported content that results in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. Accordingly, there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-\nsupported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView ad platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nThrough our OneView ad platform, advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage\ntheir OTT, desktop and mobile advertising campaigns. OneView leverages the demand-side platform developed by\ndataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of our\nproprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic OTT ad buying is an emerging market, and\nour current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not shift to programmatic ad buying from other\nbuying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for programmatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or\ndevelops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising agencies may not use OneView or we may not attract\nprospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and our business could be harmed. In addition, if\nOneView does not have the functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be\nable to attract their advertising spend to OneView, or our existing customers may not maintain or increase their\nspend on OneView. Moreover, our ownership of OneView may negatively impact the ability of OneView to purchase\nadvertising on non-Roku platforms. If we fail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to our customers’\nevolving needs, advertisers and advertising agencies will not adopt OneView, and our business may be harmed. We\nalso may not be able to compete effectively with more established demand-side platforms or be able to adapt to\nchanges or trends in programmatic OTT advertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue and\nharm our business.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners in the United States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service\noperators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand and manufacturing\npartners. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and\ninternational markets. In the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has\nmaterially contributed to our active account growth, streaming hours, and platform monetization efforts. This\ngrowth has primarily been driven by North America; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to\ncertain international markets and represents a growing share of new active accounts. We license the Roku OS and our\nsmart TV reference designs to certain licensed Roku TV partners to manufacture Roku TV models. We do not typically\nreceive, nor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we expect to incur\nexpenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that we derive from these\nlicense arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing our active accounts,\nincreasing streaming hours, and generating content distribution and advertising-related revenue on our platform. If\nthese arrangements do not continue to result in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth\ndoes not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\n18\nTable o f Contents\nWhile we recently announced the launch of a new line of Roku-branded TVs (the Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs)\nthat will be designed, made, and sold by us, the loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner in the near\nfuture could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from\nother partners and distribution channels, increase our marketing costs, and result in the loss of revenue. If we\nare not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with any of these third parties, or if we\nencounter technological, content licensing, or other impediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or\nmaintain our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have also developed licensing relationships with certain service operators, primarily in international markets;\nhowever, this program has been decreasing in scale in recent years, as we have shifted the focus of our\ninternational growth to the sale of Roku streaming devices and expanding our Roku OS licensing program with\nlicensed Roku TV partners. Based on the decreasing scale of our licensing program for service operators, including\ntermination of these relationships, we expect that the number of active accounts generated from this program will\ncontinue to decline, which may impact the overall growth rate of our active accounts in international markets.\nOur licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential\npartners include TV brands, cable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers. Under these license\narrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources these entities\ndedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their forecasts and\nanticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to meet their forecasts or such\nlaunches in the future. If our licensed Roku TV partners or service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts\nor such launches for distributing licensed streaming devices or choose to deploy competing streaming solutions\nwithin their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the top three streaming services represented over 50%\nof all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically\nstreamed a large percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, our active\naccounts, or Roku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and content. In order to remain\ncompetitive, we must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels, streaming channel features, and\ncontent, particularly as we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by Roku OS, or enter new\nmarkets, including international markets. If we are not successful in helping our content publishers launch and\nmaintain streaming channels and streaming channel features that attract and retain a significant number of users on\nour streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be harmed. Our\nability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel offerings on a cost-effective\nbasis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain channels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand\ntheir audiences on our platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content publishers may result in the removal of certain\nchannels or channel features from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates and rights to terminate under certain circumstances. Our agreements with content publishers\ngenerally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the end of the term by the content\npublisher under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter\nbankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content publishers’ security or other platform certification\nrequirements.\n19\nTable o f Contents\nUpon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing\ncontent from these content publishers on our streaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future\nmay not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements\nhave expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, or if a\ncontent publisher terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we may be required to temporarily or\npermanently remove certain channels or channel features from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such channels or channel features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our\nbusiness. More broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to\nus, or at all, or if these content publishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may\nlose channel partners or users and our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels. Accordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video ad\ninventory on our platform. For certain channels, including YouTube’s ad-supported channel, we have no access to\nvideo ad inventory at this time, and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services\nintroduce new ad-supported tiers to their streaming services, we have in the past and in the future may not be able\nto reach agreement on access to video ad inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. The\namount, quality, and cost of video ad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow\nand maintain a sufficient supply of quality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our new home screen menu features or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nin order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels on our streaming platform. If we introduce\nnew features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a change may not comply with certain content\npublishers’ certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers may find other languages, such as\nHTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their channels on other platforms. If\nkey content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop channels for, do not\nvalue and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine\nthat our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their certification requirements, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform are not relevant or\nnot engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our users. Existing and\nprospective advertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and media and entertainment\npromotional spending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem\nirrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of\nour advertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but we may not be\nsuccessful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and content publishers.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, overly intrusive or too frequent and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using our\nplatform, which will harm our business.\n20\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. For example, we previously acquired content rights, including rights to certain projects in\ndevelopment, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and announced that The Roku Channel\nwould become the home of such content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old House\nbusiness, which own and produce the “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related\nbusiness lines, to further the growth strategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel. We also\ncommission original content that we own and distribute on The Roku Channel.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers,\nusage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, following the Quibi and This Old House transactions and the launch of our advertising brand studio, we\nare producing content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited experience\nproducing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing to our\nusers and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with content\nproduction, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not\nrelevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available\ncontent, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not\ngenerate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition, we distribute The\nRoku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising through the\ndistribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content publishers. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or\nsubscriptions for any reason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content\npublishers or by other means for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn\nfrom sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their\nspending on such in-channel transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business\nmay be harmed.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that are outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access\n(including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband content delivery, broadband\nservice providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content traveling on their networks, the\nquality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for users relative to other sources of content, the\nquality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms, and other macroeconomic conditions.\nAccordingly, our growth and the future evolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact our\nsuccess, is dependent on many factors that are outside of our control.\n21\nTable o f Contents\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and\nfor the Roku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, and MediaMarkt in Germany. As we have only recently expanded to\ncertain international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or relationships with retailers for\nthose markets as compared to our sales channels in the United States or our competitors in international markets.\nAmazon and Walmart in total accounted for 59% of our devices revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,\nand 57% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. We have no minimum purchase\ncommitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or distributors. If one or several retailers or\ndistributors were to discontinue selling our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to\nprominently display those devices in their stores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their\nbrick and mortar locations, the volume of our products or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could\ndecrease, which would harm our business. If any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work\nexclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to, other operating system developers,\nthis may adversely impact our ability to continue to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV\nbrands and our ability to continue to grow active accounts and monetize the Roku OS. Traditional retailers have\nlimited shelf and end cap space in their stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited\nprime website product placement space. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more\nextensive product lines, stronger brand identity and greater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google,\npossesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own\ncompetitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart home devices, is able to market and promote these products more\nprominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or promote our products on its website. Any reduction in our\nability to place and promote our products, or increased competition for available shelf or website placement, could\nrequire us to increase our marketing or other expenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in\nreduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In particular, the availability of product\nplacement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are\nunable to effectively sell our products during these periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nproducts or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of the\nRoku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content that our content publishers\nprovide, may be out of our control, yet users may nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be\nable to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our\ncompetitors are larger companies and may have greater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through\ntraditional advertising, digital advertising or website product placement. If we are unable to execute on building\na strong brand, it may be difficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in\nthe marketplace, therefore our ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may\nbe harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of channels, representing a variety of\ncontent from a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and\nwatch, and they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to Roku streaming devices. While\nwe have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates\nthird-party rights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content.\nControversies related to the content included on certain channels that we distribute have resulted in, and could in\nthe future result in, negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may\nharm our business.\n22\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In\naddition, we typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising\nindustry. While we attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies,\nwe are not always successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter\ncycles than our accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of\ncredit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our demand-side platform. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit\nlosses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-\noffs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may\nincrease over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies\non time or at all, our business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users, advertisers, content partners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve issues relating to our products and our streaming\nplatform. A high level of support is critical for the success of our business. We currently outsource the majority\nof our customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end\nusers. In addition, we train our licensed Roku TV partners and service operator licensees to provide first-level\ncustomer support to users of Roku TV models. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage our third-party\ncustomer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if that support organization does not succeed\nin helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability\nto monetize our streaming platform, to sell our products to consumers and could harm our reputation with potential\nnew customers and our licensees.\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. In particular, we recently introduced Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs (a new line\nof Roku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023) and Roku smart home products (including\nindoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smart lighting, and smart plugs) and related subscription services.\nThe introduction of a new product or service is a complex task, involving significant expenditures in research and\ndevelopment, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to new risks. The introduction\nof new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may result in new or enhanced\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications that could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results. For example, we have faced and may continue to face new\nintellectual property infringement claims related to new products and services we have introduced. In addition, our\nentrance into entirely new lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV streaming and advertising,\nsuch as our launch of Roku smart home products, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ\nfrom the risks we face as a result of our TV streaming business.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. The development of\nnew products and services is a highly complex process, and while our research and development efforts are aimed at\nsolving increasingly complex problems, we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. The successful\ndevelopment and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\n23\nTable o f Contents\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments, which could impact the\npricing, timing and availability of new products and depress consumer demand, limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies, and lead to shortages;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract\nmanufacturers, and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from labor disputes, strikes, mechanical\nissues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health crises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems have impaired, and could in the future\nimpair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our\ncontract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers. Alternative\ncontract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our production\nrequirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely basis, or at\nall. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could require us to\nreduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our revenue, or incur\nhigher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\n24\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the current tensions\nbetween Taiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese\nsuppliers, our supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international\nlocation of these facilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade\nrestrictions on exports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports: restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower active account and streaming hour growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by Roku OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi front-\nend module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a second\nsource.\n25\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflict, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content\npublishers and other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all\nchannels and other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, including virtual multi-\nchannel video programming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not\nprovide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase active\naccount growth and user engagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will be\nharmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, our recently announced Roku-\nbranded TVs, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function well with these\nofferings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content publishers have the right to test and\ncertify our new products before we can publish their channels. The certification processes can be time consuming\nand introduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new\nproducts on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain certifications, our product release\nplans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products to all licensed Roku TV partners or\nwe may not continue to offer certain channels. To continue to grow our active accounts and user engagement, we will\nneed to prioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies, and\nsystems, including our recently announced smart home products. If we are unable to maintain consistent operability\nof Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms, our business could be harmed. In\naddition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, such as virtual\nservice operators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku\nstreaming devices. We may not successfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these\nofferings, technologies, or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems, our business could be harmed.\n26\nTable o f Contents\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any number of ways\nin our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, data\nloss or poor quality, device malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. Some errors may only be\ndiscovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be detected under certain\ncircumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance\nprocesses, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such update.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable cost and expense. Should we have a\nwidespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to\ndevelop new products or streaming platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize or enable certain industry standard and other commercially available technology in our products and\nstreaming platform that is licensed by third parties. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to\nour products and on our streaming platform, we may be required to license additional technologies from third\nparties. These third-party licenses may be unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party licenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies\nwith lower quality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of\nour products, streaming platform, and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability again in\nthe near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $588.0 million. We generally expect our\noperating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to expand our operations and invest in growth and new\nareas, although we expect operating expense year-over-year growth to significantly decline over the course of 2023.\nIf our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may not be able to\nachieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of reasons,\nincluding without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may encounter\nunforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may result in\nlosses in future periods.\n27\nTable o f Contents\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels, or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment (which generates revenue from\nthe sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products, and related accessories, and licensing\narrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV brand partners) has lower gross margins compared to our\nplatform segment (which generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls). Gross margins on our streaming players, audio products, and smart home products vary across\nmodels and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component\ncosts, device returns, and other cost fluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin in an\neffort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our gross profit. As a result, our devices revenue may\nnot increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless we are able to continue to increase our\nplatform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be unable to grow gross profit and our business\nwill be harmed. For example, in the past, global supply chain disruptions have resulted in shipping delays,\nincreased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices, which negatively affected our\ndevices gross margin. If a reduction in gross margin does not result in an increase in our active accounts or an\nincrease in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be\nharmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, lower\ngross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower than we anticipate, our financial results\nmay suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\n28\nTable o f Contents\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows. For example, in November 2022, we approved a workforce reduction plan\ndesigned to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce with current\nbusiness needs, priorities, and near term growth expectations. If we are unable to manage our growth and expansion\nplans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and\nhave greater experience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nprohibiting improper payments to government officials and requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records\nand a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by\nincumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of\nUkraine), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions (such as the tension\nbetween China and Taiwan), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\n29\nTable o f Contents\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nany pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the\nuse of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report for additional information);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our business model in international markets. Three\ncore areas of focus define our business model: first, we grow scale by increasing our active accounts; second, we\ngrow engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed through our platform; and, third, we grow monetization\nof the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Even if we are able to increase our active\naccounts in international markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our streaming hours or monetize user\nactivity in those markets. Further, our ARPU may be lower in international markets than in the United States. If we\ninvest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully\nand in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to grow our active accounts, which typically\nreduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our product sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, reductions in consumer discretionary spending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our\nsupply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or air freight delays, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, in the quarter\nended December 31, 2022, macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressures negatively affected consumer\nelectronics sales during the holiday season. In addition, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the\npast, and may in the future, adversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver\nproducts to retailers during holiday seasons.\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\n30\nTable o f Contents\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. Because we face\nsignificant competition to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer,\ncompetitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, many\ncompanies now offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for employees from\nemployers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and may in the\nfuture need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition and other\nbusiness and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees\nnecessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of\nreplacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nany workforce reduction, such as the reduction we announced in November 2022, could harm employee morale and\nnegatively impact employee recruiting and retention. In addition, the equity ownership of many of our employees\ncould create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees\nand our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could\nadversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and\ndisputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial\nreturns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions. In addition, the process of\nintegrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies involve areas of operation in\nwhich we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully, our business could be harmed.\n31\nTable o f Contents\nWe have outstanding debt, and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement, dated February 19, 2019 (as amended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”)\namong us, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders and\nissuing banks from time to time party thereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal\namount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement contains a number of\naffirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability\nto respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00,\ntested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the prior period of our four consecutive fiscal\nquarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a security interest in substantially all of our\nand our subsidiary guarantors’ assets.\nIn November 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million from the Term Loan A Facility. We\nalso had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 totaling $37.7 million against the Revolving Credit\nFacility. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities” elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report. Our Credit Agreement matures on February 19, 2023, and we expect to repay the $80.0 million\nbalance outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future,\nwe currently have no other committed sources of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us, if at all. See the risk factor below titled “ We may require additional capital to meet our\nfinancial obligations and support planned business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms or at all. ”\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other event\nof default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give it the\nright to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would have the\nright to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If the outstanding\ndebt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient\nassets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on the one-month\nU.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate.\nIf we borrow pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we are permitted to choose LIBOR as the benchmark for\nestablishing the applicable interest rate as well. LIBOR, which is calculated and published for various currencies\nand periods by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), is in the process of being phased out. The IBA has\nceased publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and intends to cease publication of\nall other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (including the one-month setting) after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, in the\nnear future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and\nother pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past,\nincluding during the transition period. Although our Credit Agreement will mature in February 2023 (before the\ncessation of the publication of the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR setting), the consequences of the LIBOR\ndevelopments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our LIBOR-linked\nfinancial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our Credit Agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\n32\nTable o f Contents\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nOur Credit Agreement matures on February 19, 2023. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future, we\ncurrently have no other committed sources of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory\nto us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business\nchallenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, user video and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential\ninformation. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry\nstandards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of personal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security\nsafeguards as part of an information security program, and limits on the use or cross-border transfer of such\npersonal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our business partners, our\nusers, and other relevant stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential\nusers.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and user video\nand audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or\ncould have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential\ninformation. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex. While all\ninformation technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches,\nincidents, attacks, and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information\ntechnology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such\nsystems vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal, and external threats on our technology environment.\nVulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors,\nbusiness partners, or by malicious third parties.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have experienced,\nand remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and improper employee\naccess of confidential data. Malicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence,\nsophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a\nwide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized\ncriminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting\ngeopolitical conflict also have increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations\nglobally, including for companies headquartered in the United States.\nMost of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols and offer work-issued devices to employees, the actions of\nour employees while working from home may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we\nprocess, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from\nemployees’ combined use of personal and private devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\n33\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent publishers’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity.\nRecent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks,\nwith increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and\nmethodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may impact our\nability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors experience an\noutage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally, our third-party\nvendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such third parties\nfor use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open source software, which may be incorporated into our\nsystems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which we are not\naware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. For example, the Apache Log4j vulnerability discovered in\nDecember 2021 can be exploited by remote code execution, which can allow a bad actor to steal data or take over our\nsystems. We have taken steps to patch this vulnerability by updating our relevant Apache software, but we, and the\nmany other affected organizations, remain vulnerable in light of the widespread use of the Apache Log4j library and\ndifficulty in identifying all instances of this library across an entire enterprise. We cannot assure you that we\nwill not be impacted by this or other similar vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that security incidents may not be covered by our insurance\npolicies, and not all aspects of a security incident may be covered even where coverage exists. Insurance policies\nwill also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security incident. Even where an incident is\ncovered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we\nmay be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our platform, streaming devices,\nsmart home products, website, computer systems, or mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us\nto liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our reputation. Efforts\nto prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in our products are\nexpensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or vulnerabilities.\nSuch unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk\nof contractual damages, litigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of\nharm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings\nand as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial\nresources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\n34\nTable o f Contents\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming,\ndistracting, and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations,\nand contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This\ncould result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm.\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be\nable to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential\ninformation, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nother consumers, employees, job applicants and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect,\nprocess, transmit, and store personal or confidential information (including our users’ payment card data and video\nand audio recordings). We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service\nproviders and our business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related\ntechnologies, to help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and\npartners’ content to deliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our\npartners on our products.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our\nservice providers’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws,\nregulations, and industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit\naccess to or storage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for\nadvertising) that is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of\na transmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes.\n35\nTable o f Contents\nAdditionally, certain device manufacturers or operating system providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, or otherwise restrict the collection of personal information through these or other tools,\nvia our applications. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our\nrevenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising\ncampaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally.\nPrivacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”),\nstate attorneys general, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian\nnational data protection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and\nforeign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict\nindustry participants’ ability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of\nconsumer notice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For\nexample, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the\ncollection, storage, and use of personal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in\nthe context of EU operations) and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations, and may\nrequire us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done.\nIn addition, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted\na framework similar to the GDPR. The EU has recently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being\n“adequate” to receive EU personal data. We are monitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data\nprotection framework and the impact this may have on our business.\nWe will continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not\ncompliant with data protection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines\nand penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For\nexample, under the GDPR, fines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data\nprocessing restrictions, could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Data protection laws\ncontinue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For example, Brazil’s\nGeneral Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) came into effect in August 2020. The LGPD bears many substantive similarities\nto the GDPR such as extra-territorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data transfer restrictions,\nand mandatory breach notification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a company’s annual revenue in\nBrazil.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based\ndata privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider\nadditional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an\neffort to comply.\nFor example, effective October 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”)\nto require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to intake requests\nfrom consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Effective January 2020, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information, such as\nrights to access, and require deletion of, their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal\ninformation, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides\nfor civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data\nbreach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023 (with a\n“look-back” to January 1, 2022), builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment of a\ndedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy issues. In recent years, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah\nhave adopted laws introducing new privacy obligations for which we may need to take additional steps to comply.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business. Among other things, such restrictions are likely to increase the number of users\nto whom we cannot serve targeted advertising, and are likely to restrict our ability to collect and process certain\ntypes of information deemed sensitive under these new laws. The Canadian province of Quebec has also recently\nenacted a data protection law, known as Bill 64, that may similarly restrict our data processing activities.\n36\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United\nStates, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to\nthe United States. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be an\ninvalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues\nregarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On March 25, 2022, the European\nCommission and U.S. government announced that an agreement in principle on a new framework for data transfers from\nthe EEA to the United States had been reached, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), and\nthat this new framework should address the concerns raised in the 2020 European Court of Justice decision. On\nDecember 13, 2022, the European Commission released its draft adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. DPF, which, once\nformally adopted, would recognize that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data\ntransferred from the EU to organizations certified under the EU-U.S. DPF. Additional steps will need to be taken to\nformally adopt and implement this framework, however, and we are not yet able to predict precisely when or the\ndegree to which it will provide a consistent mechanism for our data transfers between the two jurisdictions. In\naddition, in 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be\nincorporated into new and existing agreements by no later than December 27, 2022 in order to continue to lawfully\ntransfer personal information outside of the EEA. The United Kingdom published final versions of its own Model\nClauses in February 2022. Updating agreements to incorporate these new Model Clauses for the EEA and United Kingdom\nhas required, may in the future require, significant time and resources to implement, including through adjusting\nour operations, conducting requisite data transfer assessments, and revising our contracts. In addition, cloud\nservice providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny from EU regulators, which may\nlead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal information outside the EU,\nwhich may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate. We continue to assess the available regulatory\nguidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data Protection Authorities and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce on international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on specific supplementary\nmeasures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data sharing that may be deemed a cross-border\ntransfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our ability to continue to transfer personal\ninformation outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and\nliability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to\nconduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CPRA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so.\n37\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, representatives,\nagents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state, and federal action if they\nare found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku OS, streaming platform, smart home products,\nand computer systems. For example, our smart home product line is reliant on (among other things) the engineering\nand software development teams and information technology systems of the service providers we use to assist in the\ndesign, manufacture, and maintenance of those products. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our products\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we\nexercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that\nthey may experience. In the future, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting\nsystems to cloud computing services, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we\nare unable to manage such a transition effectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services,\noperational delays, or inefficiencies until the transition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any\nof our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on\nterms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor\nto another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In\naddition, fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications\nfailures, break-ins, and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\n38\nTable o f Contents\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also offer consumers\nmultichannel video programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators\nhave an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of\nother companies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to\nprovide preferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent\nlitigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of\nour competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their\nsubstantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant\nmanagement time and divert management’s attention from our other business concerns. Uncertainties resulting from\nthe initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in\nthe marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties.\nFor example, we have in the past elected to develop and implement specific design changes to address potential\nrisks that certain products could otherwise become subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In\naddition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to\nresolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\n39\nTable o f Contents\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\nobtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential\nproprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade\nsecrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or\nmisappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a\ntrade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result in substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim\nis unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our\ncompetitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a\ncompetitive advantage in our market, which could harm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. U.S. patent laws,\nand the scope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change\nto “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to\nprotect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. In particular, our actions to monitor\nand enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit versions of our products or products\nbearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from us,\ntarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open source software or compliance with open source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open source software license terms.\n40\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. In such event,\nwe could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar open source\nsoftware license terms to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in\norder to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in\nthe event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could harm our business.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract\nmanufacturers, and suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to\ninfringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku TV partners often\ninvolve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there\nis a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to\nour technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually limited.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nGlobal economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including\nincreased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in\neconomic policy, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, and global supply chain constraints. Such macroeconomic\nuncertainties may continue for an extended period and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely\nimpact, many aspects of our business.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic\nconsequences. While we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours and account activations at the beginning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, more recently, we believe this growth has declined. In 2022, global supply chain disruptions\nresulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices, and\nsome of our licensed Roku TV partners faced inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales.\nOur business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both of which are\nsusceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary\nfears, and economic uncertainty. Sustained or worsening inflation or an economic downturn may result in fewer\nconsumer purchases of our products or the products of our licensed Roku TV partners (which could impact our active\naccount growth) and reduced advertising spending (which could impact our monetization efforts). Some of our\nadvertising verticals have experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product\navailability, which, together with inflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers reducing\ntheir overall advertising spend. If this pullback in consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending\ncontinues, our future operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact our operational and financial performance\nremains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may\nnegatively affect our business and operating results.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine), terrorist attack, medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other man-\nmade disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our business operations. Any of these business\ndisruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\n41\nTable o f Contents\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power\noutages. Further, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a disaster or other catastrophic event and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing the reference design of TVs powered by Roku\nOS, we were required to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations\nregarding the manufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and we or our licensed Roku TV\npartners may be unable to sell TVs powered by Roku OS at all, which could harm our business and our ability to grow\nour user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, children’s online protection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little\nharmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and\nother government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and\nother tracking technologies to collect, use, and share user information. Certain state laws, such as the CCPA, the\nCPRA, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, also impose requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, the EU has adopted the Digital Services Act, which is legislation that updates the liability and safety\nrules for digital platforms, products, and services. If we or the third parties that we work with, such as contract\npayment processing services, content publishers, vendors, or developers, violate or are alleged to violate\napplicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such\nviolations and alleged violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business\nand reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers,\nor publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply\nwith these laws may subject us to liability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties.\n42\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, the FTC has initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(“COPPA”), which limits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children under\nthe age of 13. The review could result in broadening the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information\nthat are subject to these regulations. There have also been proposals in the U.S. Congress to amend and expand\nCOPPA. Changes to the COPPA legislation or rules could limit the information that we or our content publishers and\nadvertisers may collect and use and the content of advertisements in relation to certain channel partner content.\nThe CPRA and certain other state privacy laws also impose certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain\ninformation about minors can be collected.\nThe EU and many of its member states, among other jurisdictions, also have rules that limit processing of personal\ndata, including children’s data, and that impose specific requirements intended to protect children online. We and\nour content publishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other\nprivacy, advertising, children’s online protection, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Additionally, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United\nStates and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus, and the United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take\nother actions should the conflict further escalate. These and other geopolitical tensions and trade disputes can\ndisrupt supply chains and increase the cost of our products and the components required to manufacture our\nproducts, as well as costs for our licensed Roku TV partners. This could cause our products and those of our\nlicensed Roku TV partners to be more expensive for consumers, which could reduce the demand for or attractiveness\nof such products. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to\nconduct business operations in that region. Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other\nmeasures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our\noperations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of\nrestrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the\nadverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also\ncould have a negative impact on consumer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future\ngrowth. In particular, given the general deterioration in U.S.-China relations and ongoing tensions on trade,\nsecurity, and human rights, additional U.S. sanctions, tariffs, and export or import restrictions, as well as\nChinese sanctions or retaliatory measures, remain a serious risk.\nWe cannot predict whether new international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing trade agreements\nrenegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the Biden Administration with other U.S.\ntrading partners; or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry\nor our business or licensees. If any new legislation or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade\nagreements are renegotiated or terminated, or if tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be\ninefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes,\nand higher prices could depress consumer demand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\n43\nTable o f Contents\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation could have negative consequences, including government\ninvestigations or penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nIn addition, the effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be\nfar-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic\nconditions. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people\nbetween the United Kingdom and the EU, and some disruptions have already occurred. Brexit could also lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate.\nAlthough the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on the EU-UK post-Brexit economic relationship took effect on\nJanuary 1, 2021, it is incomplete, and the full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given these possibilities and\nothers we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Laws, regulations, or court\nrulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including decisions that undermine\nopen and neutrally administered internet access, or that disincentivize internet access network operators’\nwillingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their equipment, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations governing the provision of internet access service.\nSubstantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in 2015,\nthe FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content\npartners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. More recently, the Biden Administration signed an\nexecutive order encouraging the FCC to readopt comprehensive open internet rules. The FCC therefore could consider\nadopting additional or modified rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for data and services. If network operators were to engage in restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, any of\nwhich could harm our business. Several states and foreign countries in which we operate also have adopted or are\nconsidering rules governing the provision of internet access.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n44\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The\nNasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and\nmanagement resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to\npredict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\n45\nTable o f Contents\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other\npenalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation,\nand require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2022, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.4% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n46\nTable o f Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation or derivative litigation. For example, a stockholder previously filed a\nderivative lawsuit (which has been dismissed), purportedly on our behalf, against certain members of our Board and\nmanagement in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent\nworkers may also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is\ndilutive to existing stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n47\nTable o f Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, on\ncommittees of our Board, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\n48\nTable o f Contents\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business.",

          "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2021 filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.\nOverview\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we reorganized our reportable segments to better align with\nmanagement’s reporting of information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for each segment. We\nrenamed our “player” segment to “devices” which now includes our licensing arrangements with service operators and\nlicensed Roku TV partners in addition to sales of our streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\nRoku-branded TVs that will be designed, made, and sold by us in 2023. Our historical segment information is recast\nto conform to our new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report.\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising and related services including the demand-side platform and content distribution\nservices such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the\nsale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products, and,\nbeginning in 2023, Roku-branded TVs, and related accessories as well as from licensing arrangements with service\noperators and licensed Roku TV partners. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices (“ASP”) of Roku\nstreaming devices to increase our active accounts. We expect that the trade off from devices gross profit or loss\nto grow active accounts will result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit.\nBusiness Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, such as increased inflation and interest rates, recessionary fears, financial and credit\nmarket fluctuations, changes in economic policy, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain constraints,\nand geopolitical developments (such as the war in Ukraine), have had, and we believe will continue to have, an\nimpact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, some of our licensed Roku TV partners faced\ninventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales. In addition, some of our advertising verticals\nexperienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted their product availability, which, together with\ninflation and other macroeconomic factors, have resulted in advertisers in a variety of industries reducing their\noverall advertising spend, which has adversely affected our platform revenue. We believe rising inflation and\nrecessionary fears also have led to a reduction in consumer discretionary spending, which has driven a decrease in\nour devices revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, although to a lesser extent than in\nthe past. The ongoing effects of the pandemic and associated economic conditions remain difficult to predict due to\nnumerous uncertainties. We believe that the direct and indirect impacts of these business conditions and\nmacroeconomic factors are difficult to isolate or quantify. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding\nForward Looking Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details.\n52\nTable o f Contents\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. All of our gross profit is generated from our platform\nsegment.\nOur gross profit was $1,441.1 million and $1,408.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 2%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. Additionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not\nincluded in our reported number of active accounts. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the\nnumber of unique individuals who actively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an\naccount. For example, a single account may be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account\nmay be used on multiple streaming devices.\nWe had 70.0 million and 60.1 million active accounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively reflecting an\nincrease of 16%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku platforms are\nnot included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our streaming hours. We report\nstreaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content publishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming\nhours does not correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis.\nMoreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel\nmay continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also\noccurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to\nidentify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user\ninteraction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm\nthat they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond\naffirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our\ncustomers, channel partners, and advertisers. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nimplemented similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature supplements these channel features. This\nfeature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 87.4 billion and 73.2 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\nreflecting an increase of 19%.\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $41.68 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $40.67 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of\n2%.\n53\nTable o f Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from digital advertising sales and related services including our demand-side ad\nplatform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue sharing arrangements, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls. Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku Channel, native\ndisplay ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well as ad inventory we obtain through our content distribution\nagreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-sell video inventory that we purchase from content\npublishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party inventory on a revenue share basis. To date, we have\ngenerated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nDevices Revenue\nWe generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players and other devices such as audio products, smart home\nproducts and accessories through consumer retail distribution channels and online retailers. Our devices revenue\nalso includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners. We generate most of our\ndevices revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily sell our devices through wholesale\ndistributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Revenue, Platform\nCost of revenue, platform primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory and\namortization costs of content, both licensed and produced, and revenue share with content publishers. Cost of\nrevenue, platform also includes other costs such as payment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the\ndelivery of our services that primarily include costs of third-party cloud services and salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our customer support and platform operations personnel, and amortization of acquired\ndeveloped technology.\nCost of Revenue, Devices\nCost of revenue, devices is comprised mostly of manufacturing costs payable to third party manufacturers for\ndevices we sell which include streaming players, audio products and smart home products. Cost of revenue, devices\nalso includes technology licenses or royalty fees on devices we sell or license, inbound and outbound freight, duty\nand logistics costs, third-party packaging, inventory provisions, and allocated overhead costs related to\nfacilities, customer support, and salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and devices\nproducts and services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions, and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management, and partner support\nfunctions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and allocated\nfacilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future\nperiods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and devices revenue, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\nfinance, legal, information technology, human resources, and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting, and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility and overhead expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute\ndollars due to the expansion of our business and related infrastructure.\n54\nTable o f Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and\ncash equivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of services as\npart of a strategic commercial arrangement, i nter est expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization\nof deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement, and transaction gains and losses. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, other income (expense), net also includes the change in the fair value of the strategic\ninvestment.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense (benefit) consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and income taxes in the United States. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,\nincluding net operating losses primarily for the U.S. and any jurisdiction where we do not expect to realize their\nbenefits in the future. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022       2021       2020\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   87  %      82  %      70  %\nDevices                                                    13  %      18  %      30  %\nTotal net revenue                                         100  %     100  %     100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   38  %      30  %      28  %\nDevices                                                    16  %      19  %      27  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                      54  %      49  %      55  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                                                   49  %      52  %      42  %\nDevices                                                    -3  %      -1  %       3  %\nTotal gross profit                                         46  %      51  %      45  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                   25  %      17  %      20  %\nSales and marketing                                        27  %      16  %      17  %\nGeneral and administrative                                 11  %       9  %      10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                   63  %      42  %      47  %\nIncome (Loss) from Operations                             -17  %       9  %      -2  %\nOther Income (Expense), Net:\nInterest expense                                            —  %       —  %       —  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 1  %       —  %       —  %\nTotal other income (expense), net                           1  %       —  %       —  %\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes                         -16  %       9  %      -2  %\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                                —  %       —  %       —  %\nNet Income (Loss)                                         -16  %       9  %      -2  %\n55\nTable o f Contents\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nNet Revenue\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 2,711,441    $  2,264,920    $   446,521          20  %\nDevices                                                   415,093         499,664        -84,571         -17  %\nTotal net revenue                     $                 3,126,534    $  2,764,584    $   361,950          13  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $446.5 million, or 20%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to higher advertising revenue which includes revenue from our\ndemand-side ad platform as well as higher content distribution services, including higher revenue from media and\nentertainment promotional spending and Premium Subscriptions.\nDevices\nDevices revenue decreased by $84.6 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in both the volume of streaming players sold and average\nselling prices. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the volume of streaming players sold decreased by 14% and\nthe average selling price of streaming players decreased by 5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We\nbelieve the decrease in the volume of streaming players sold is due to a reduction in consumer discretionary spend\nas a result of inflationary pressures. The decrease in the average selling price is due to higher promotions during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 where the volume was aided by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and required fewer promotions. The slowdown in growth also impacted the revenue from sale of\naudio products and revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners which\nwas slightly offset by revenue from sale of accessories and smart home products.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,179,675    $    818,506    $   361,169          44  %\nDevices                                                   505,737         537,478        -31,741          -6  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,685,412    $  1,355,984    $   329,428          24  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,531,766    $  1,446,414    $    85,352           6  %\nDevices                                                   -90,644         -37,814        -52,830         140  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,441,122    $  1,408,600    $    32,522           2  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of revenue, platform increased by $361.2 million, or 44%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily driven by higher advertising inventory\ncosts, higher content amortization costs, Premium Subscription costs, and credit card processing fees all totaling\n$293.4 million. Platform costs increased an additional $67.3 million due to higher personnel costs and increases in\ncloud services costs for supporting the platform.\nGross profit for the platform segment increased by $85.4 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the overall growth in our platform revenue.\n56\nTable o f Contents\nDevices\nThe cost of revenue, devices decreased by $31.7 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower cost of revenue of $25.2 million due to\na decrease in the volume of streaming players sold, a decrease in royalty expenses of $6.2 million and a decrease\nin freight costs of $4.1 million, offset by an increase in inventory reserve, purchase commitment losses and\nreduction in supplier rebates totaling $5.7 million.\nGross loss for the devices segment increased by $52.8 million, or 140%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe the gross loss was driven by lower devices revenue due to\noverall decrease in consumer spending combined with disruptions in the global supply chain driving component prices\nhigher in 2022 as compared to 2021. We expect to incur negative gross margin in the devices segment in the near\nfuture as we continue to insulate consumers from price increases and incur costs from expected promotional\nactivities related to new product launches.\nOperating Expenses\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022            2021       Change $    Change %\nResearch and development              $                   788,913    $    461,602    $   327,311          71  %\nSales and marketing                                       838,419         455,601        382,818          84  %\nGeneral and administrative                                344,678         256,297         88,381          34  %\nTotal operating expenses              $                 1,972,010    $  1,173,500    $   798,510          68  %\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $327.3 million, or 71%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $241.1 million as a result of increased engineering headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase\nin facilities costs of $52.7 million due to expansion of office spaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $19.6\nmillion related to restructuring charges, and higher consulting, professional services, and cloud services costs of\n$13.4 million.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $382.8 million, or 84%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $172.7 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation in sales and sales support,\nproduct management, marketing, and business analytics to support efforts to grow our business. Sales and marketing\nexpenses also include an increase of $160.0 million mainly due to increases in marketing, retail and merchandising\ncosts and general sales promotions, an increase in facilities costs of $20.9 million due to expansion of office\nspaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $11.0 million in professional services and consulting fees, and an\nincrease of $10.9 million related to restructuring charges.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $88.4 million, or 34%, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $72.5 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase in facilities\ncosts of $16.2 million due to expansion of office spaces and IT infrastructure, an increase of $7.6 million related\nto restructuring charges, a net increase of $4.6 million related to higher travel expenses, an increase in credit\nlosses and higher general overhead, offset by a decrease of $11.2 million related to lower legal expenses,\nconsulting, and professional services fees.\n57\nTable o f Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2022         2021       Change $    Change %\nInterest expense                      $                    -5,161    $  -2,980    $    -2,181          73  %\nOther income (expense), net                                43,766        4,467         39,299         880  %\nTotal other income (expense), net     $                    38,605    $   1,487    $    37,118              n/m\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, increased by $37.1 million, during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2021.

Less than 2% of our cash was held\noutside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign operations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue and proceeds from equity sales,\nincluding equity issued pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting\nand professional service fees, and facility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of\nproperty and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses for facility and building related costs for our office locations in the\nUnited States and internationally. In addition, we expect to continue our investments in purchases of computer\nsystems and other property and equipment. We have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, such as\nthe acquisition of the Nielsen AVA business, the This Old House business, and content rights from Quibi in fiscal\n2021, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition activities in the future, including the acquisition of\nrights to programming and content assets. These activities can materially impact our liquidity and capital\nresources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet\nour working capital, capital expenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for\nthe next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows\nfrom operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed\nin Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the effects of the current macroeconomic environment.\nWhile the current macroeconomic environment has not severely impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date,\nit has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital and credit markets, which could\nadversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\n58\nTable o f Contents\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Facility (described below) matures in February 2023, upon which we expect to pay off the remaining balance\nof $80.0 million. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be subject\nto fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants. Additionally, due to the current macroeconomic\nenvironment, we may be unable to obtain debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn March 2, 2021, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc., and Evercore Group L.L.C., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we could offer and sell from time-\nto-time shares of our Class A common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $1,000.0 million. In March 2021,\nwe sold approximately 2.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average selling price of $379.26 per share,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of $1,000.0 million and incurred issuance costs of $10.4 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility will be repaid in full in February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by\nsubstantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary\naffirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to maintain a\ncertain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default. As of December 31, 2022, we\nwere in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $37.7 million and $38.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon maturity of the Credit Facility, we expect to roll over\nthe outstanding letters of credit into a new, cash secured, bilateral facility. We expect this to require the use\nof approximately $44 million of existing cash and cash equivalents to secure the outstanding letters of credit.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2022            2021\nCash flows provided by operating           $                    11,795    $    228,081\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                  -201,696    $   -176,819\nCash flows provided by financing           $                     8,357    $  1,003,147\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our net loss of\n$498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $700.1 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization on property and\nequipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, and impairment of certain\nintangible technology assets adjusted by net gains on remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and\nliabilities.\nThe changes in our operating assets and liabilities used cash totaling $190.3 million mainly from an increase in\ncontent assets acquired and paid during the period, an increase in inventory on hand, an increase in prepaid\nexpenses and accounts receivable balances offset by inflows from an increase in accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities and an increase in deferred revenue balances. These changes are mainly due to overall growth in the\nbusiness combined with the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.\n59\nTable o f Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 included cash outflows of $201.7 million consisting\nof purchases of property and equipment and expenditures related to the expansion of our office facilities of $161.7\nmillion and the purchase of a strategic investment of $40.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We received cash\nproceeds of $18.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These inflows were offset by $10.0 million\nof repayments made on borrowings.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 consisted of:\nPrincipal payments related to our Term Loan A Facility that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and\nthe related periodic interest payments. For additional information regarding the terms of the debt and interest\npayable, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our manufacturers and other inventory related items. Consistent with\nindustry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with our\nmanufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders\nbased on projected demand information. Our manufacturers source components and build our products based on these\ndemand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our products may result in us being\ncommitted to purchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments. For additional information regarding\nmanufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport.\nCommitments to license content from content publishers and produce content under contractual arrangements. For\nadditional information regarding content commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item\n8 of this Annual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $6.1 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations requires significant\njudgment.\n60\nTable o f Contents\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that\nmay include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangements, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our devices end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated devices. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition rates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful\nlives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit\nfrom the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to\nconsideration transferred, and the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to\nthe extent we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets and liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount rate. We amortize purchased-intangible\nassets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We review purchased-intangible assets\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally\nestimated, or that the carrying amount of the asset group to which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts\nand circumstances indicate an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group\nagainst their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over\nthe fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we\naccelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales returns\nand sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience,\npromotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and\nsales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the\nlosses or gains could be material.\n61\nTable o f Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset the U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the\nuncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax\nassets. Our valuation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from the U.S.\nand Netherlands net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. In order to assess the likelihood that we will\nrecover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income, we review the level of positive and\nnegative evidence of future taxable income which is a critical estimate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2022 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. They are\nincorporated herein by reference.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents, and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest\nrates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $80.0 million with an effective interest rate\nof 4.4%. If the amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and\ninterest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease,\nrespectively, by an additional $0.8 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not entered into any derivatives or\nother financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the\nfuture.\n62\nTable o f Contents",

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Content Distribution Services and Branded Channel\nButtons – Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content publishers, management is required\nto estimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to content distribution services and\nthe sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nVariable consideration related to content distribution services and sale of branded channel buttons on remote\ncontrols (“content publisher arrangements”) is included in the estimated transaction price based on the expected\nvalue for which a significant reversal of revenue is not expected to occur. For content distribution services, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nperformance of the publisher’s applications. For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nplayer sales volumes.\n64\nTable o f Contents\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required a high degree of\nauditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nestimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content distribution\nservices and sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for content distribution services and sales of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\n◦ Tested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\n◦ Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\n◦ Tested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\n◦ We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to publishers’ content\napplications as well as our observations and inquiries as to the changes within the business and considerations of\nmacroeconomic and industry factors.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services\nincluding demand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue\nshares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\nchannel buttons on remote controls. The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio\nproducts, smart home products and licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReorganization of Reportable Segments and Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reorganized its reportable segments to better align\nwith management’s reporting of information reviewed by the CODM for each segment. The Company renamed the player\nsegment to the devices segment which now includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku\nTV partners in addition to sales of streaming players, audio products and smart home products. All financial\ninformation, current and historical, has been recast based on the reorganized segments to conform to the new\npresentation in the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 18 for additional details.\nIn addition to the prior period amounts related to segment reorganization discussed above, certain other prior\nperiod amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have also been reclassified to\nconform to the current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\namortization of content assets;\nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\nvaluation of strategic investments;\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n72\nTable o f Contents\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or\nlosses from remeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $ 8.2million, loss of $\n1.2million, and gain of $ 1.3million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Twofinancial institutions managed 26% and 21% of cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2022, and 30% and 27% as of December 31, 2021.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nBeginning balance                    $                     6,015    $    5,912    $    6,550\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   19,068        16,181        14,594\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -17,666       -16,078       -15,232\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     7,417    $    6,015    $    5,912\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nBeginning balance                       $                    48,411    $   30,838    $   19,476\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      94,731        90,530        68,315\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                       -114,239       -72,957       -56,953\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    28,903    $   48,411    $   30,838\n73\nTable o f Contents\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022         2021         2020\nBeginning balance                         $                     2,158    $   4,181    $   1,140\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                                   —            —        1,066\nAdjusted beginning balance                $                     2,158    $   4,181    $   2,206\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                          2,081         -904        3,801\naccounts\nAdjustments for write-off                                        -741       -1,119       -1,826\nEnding balance                            $                     3,498    $   2,158    $   4,181\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net\nbalance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired businesses are\nincluded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is recognized\nat fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments\nto consideration transferred, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in\nconnection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and\nreevaluates these estimates and assumptions and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates with\na corresponding offset to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is, more likely than not,\nless than its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s\ncarrying amount over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit.\n74\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes\nin business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be fully\nrecoverable or that the useful lives of the asset or asset group are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese asset or asset groups for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying\nvalue of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an\nimpairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the abandonment of future\ndevelopment of certain technology assets. This action was taken as part of the restructuring announced in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. See Note 15 for additional details. There were noimpairments of intangible\nassets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nestimated viewing trends. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets in any periods reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, the Company\nconsiders if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as\nwell as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\n75\nTable o f Contents\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side ad platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares,\nmedia and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and sale of branded channel\nbuttons on remote controls.\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies and to content\npublishers for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign tools. Advertising arrangements\ninclude video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions. Advertising arrangements include\nmultiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements,\nthe Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also\ngenerates revenue from customers using its ad platform. For such arrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is\na percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during the month, along with data and any add-on features\npurchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital\nadvertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the principal in the revenue generation\nprocess or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers\nfor the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of\nmultiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of\nthe distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\naccessories that are sold through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to customers through the\nCompany’s website. Effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company renamed the segment from player to\ndevices which now also includes revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV\npartners.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the unspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a\ntime elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\n76\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to licensed Roku TV partners and service\noperators. The licensing revenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property\navailable and the control transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades and updates is\nrecognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as\nservices are provided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service\nperiod.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto eleven years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did notcapitalize any internal-use software costs. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company capitalized internal-use software development costs of $\n0.5million and $ 2.2million, respectively. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of the asset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its\nintended use. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company amortized expenses of $\n1.0million, $ 1.0million, and $ 0.5million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers, content publishers,\nand licensing or services fees received from service operators and TV brands, where performance obligations are not\nyet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and\nthe remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\n77\nTable o f Contents\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 10.0million, $ 35.2million,\nand $ 7.1million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatility of the Company’s\nClass A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar in size and\noperational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers. ASU 2021-08 requires companies to apply Accounting Standards Codification, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with\ncustomers acquired in a business combination. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of\nTopic 848 . This guidance defers the sunset date for applying the reference rate reform relief in ASC 848 to\nDecember 31, 2024. The guidance is effective as of December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The adoption did\nnot have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n78\nTable o f Contents\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is represented by the tworeportable segments discussed in Note 18.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             760,793    $  752,393    $  523,852\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                    42,617        46,952         7,431\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       87,678        45,760        55,465\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   28,210        28,726        21,283\nTotal deferred revenue                   $             115,888    $   74,486    $   76,748\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for sales returns, sales incentives,\nand doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 4.3million during the year\nended December 31, 2022 due to the timing of billing to customers and a slower growth rate in platform revenue.\nContract assets increased by $ 39.5million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which fell into a subsequent period.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 41.4million during the year ended December 31, 2022\nprimarily due to the billings in excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations\nrelated to revenue arrangements. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ 2.3million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 primarily due to the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to content\narrangements offset by an increase in deferred revenue from advertising arrangements due to growth in the platform\nbusiness and an increase in the deferral period of devices revenue for its unspecified upgrades.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2021 was $ 47.6million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $ 56.2million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 997.4million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 56% over the next 12months and the\nremainder thereafter.\nThe Company reversed $ 3.2million and recognized $ 28.6million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nThe Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its total net revenue as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. Customer C accounted for 12% of total net revenue during the year ended December 31,\n2020.\n79\nTable o f Contents\n4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nNielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising Business\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase the Advanced Video\nAdvertising (“AVA”) business from Nielsen Holdings PLC (“Nielsen”). The AVA business consists primarily of video\nautomatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. On April 15, 2021, the Company closed the\ntransaction, acquiring from Nielsen the AVA business, consisting of certain assets and liabilities and all of the\nequity interests in a subsidiary associated with the AVA business (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the\nAcquisition, the Company and Nielsen entered into a strategic commercial arrangement under which the parties will\nprovide certain advertising measurement solutions to each other. The Company acquired Nielsen’s AVA business to\naccelerate its launch of an end-to-end linear ad replacement solution and to further integrate Nielsen’s ad and\ncontent measurement products into the Company’s ad platform.\nThe total purchase consideration for Nielsen’s AVA business was $ 53.4million, which consisted of (i) $ 38.5million\npaid in cash and (ii) $ 21.4million of non-cash consideration related to obligations to deliver services to\nNielsen, offset by (iii) $ 6.5million of services to be received from Nielsen. The obligations to deliver services\nto Nielsen were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. The services to be delivered to\nNielsen are recognized within Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The services to be received from Nielsen represent contract terms that the Company entered into\nfor future goods and services that were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. These\nservices are recognized as Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The Company incurred $ 3.9million in acquisition-related expenses that were recorded in General\nand administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nbased on estimated fair values was as follows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $        3,057\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                       85\nProperty and equipment, net                                    584\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technology                                        11,000\nIPR&D technology                                             7,500\nGoodwill                                                    36,790\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          1,235\nOther non-current assets                                     1,905\nTotal assets acquired                                       62,156\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -1,168\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion              -830\nOther long-term liabilities                                 -6,767\nTotal liabilities assumed                                   -8,765\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       53,391\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, intangible assets, and liabilities assumed was\nrecorded as goodwill. Goodwill was primarily attributable to expected synergies in advertising offerings and cross-\nselling opportunities. The majority of the goodwill recorded was deductible for tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the developed technology was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key valuation\nassumptions included the Company’s estimates of expected future earnings and royalty rate. The Company amortizes\nthe fair value of the developed technology on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The fair value\nof the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) technology was estimated using the multi-period-excess-\nearnings method. The key valuation assumptions included the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and\nmargin.\n80\nTable o f Contents\nThe valuation of the intangible assets acquired from Nielsen’s AVA business along with their estimated useful\nlives, were as follows (in thousands, except years):\nEstimated Weighted-Average Useful Lives\nEstimated Fair Value    (in years)\nDeveloped technology                $                11,000                                             5.9\nIPR&D technology                                      7,500\nEstimated fair value of acquired    $                18,500                                             5.9\nintangible assets\nThis Old House\nOn March 19, 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of TOH Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“This Old\nHouse”), a home improvement media business, according to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company acquired the This Old House business because the Company believed the content aligned with The Roku\nChannel’s ad-supported growth strategy.\nThe total purchase consideration for This Old House was $ 97.8million, paid entirely in cash.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT\nIn June 2022, the Company agreed to provide financing of up to $ 60.0million in the aggregate to a counterparty\nwith whom the Company has a commercial relationship, of which $ 40.0million was advanced in the form of convertible\npromissory notes (the “Strategic Investment”) and is recognized in Other non-current assets on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Strategic Investment accrues interest at 5% per annum and has a maturity date of June 15, 2025,\nor is due upon a redemption event or in the event of a default.\nThe Strategic Investment contains certain redemption features that meet the definition of embedded derivatives and\nrequire bifurcation. The Company elected to apply the fair value option and account for the hybrid instrument\ncontaining the host contract and the embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument, with any subsequent\nchanges in fair value included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $\n608.4million and $ 1,015.9million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, using Level 1\ninputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company measured the Strategic Investment using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the\nStrategic Investment on the date of purchase was determined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company\nrecorded an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income (expense), net related to the adjustment to fair value\nof the Strategic Investment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2021.\n86\nTable o f Contents\nThe Company classified the Strategic Investment as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over\nfair value inputs. The fair value of the Strategic Investment was estimated using a scenario-based probability\nweighted discounted cash flow model. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and\nprobability weighting of the various redemption scenarios that impact the settlement of the Strategic Investment.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\n10. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate.

(as\namended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-yearrevolving credit facility in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $ 100.0million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-yeardelayed draw\nterm loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100.0million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and\n(iii) an uncommitted incremental facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and other conditions,\nin the amount of up to (v) $ 50.0million, plus (w) 1.0x of the Company’s EBITDA for the most recently completed\nfour fiscal quarter period, plus (x) an additional amount at the Company’s discretion, so long as, on a pro forma\nbasis at the time of incurrence, the Company’s secured leverage ratio does not exceed 1.50to 1.00, plus (y)\nvoluntary prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility to the extent accompanied by\nconcurrent reductions to the applicable Credit Facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term\nLoan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\nOn November 18, 2019, the Company borrowed the Term Loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of $\n100.0million. In March 2020, the Company borrowed the available balance of $ 69.3million from the Revolving Credit\nFacility. For both borrowings, the Company elected an interest rate equal to the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate plus\nan applicable margin of 1.75% based on the Company’s secured leverage ratio.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 169.7million of non-cancelable purchase commitments for\ninventory.\nContent Commitments\nThe Company enters into contracts with content publishers to license and produce content for streaming. When a\ntitle becomes available, the Company records a content asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain licensing agreements, such as film output deals, include the obligation to license rights for unknown\nfuture titles for which the ultimate quantity and/or fees are not determinable as of the reporting date. The\nCompany does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. The\nunknown obligations could be material.\n91\nTable o f Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total obligation for licensed and produced content is $ 393.1million, of\nwhich the Company recorded $ 94.6million in Current liabilities and $ 39.6million in Other long-term liabilities in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $ 258.9million is not yet recognized on the consolidated balance\nsheets as the content does not meet the criteria for asset recognition.\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,\n2023                            230,756\n2024                            111,158\n2025                             35,394\n2026                             10,532\n2027                              1,838\nThereafter                        3,429\nTotal content liabilities    $  393,107\nThe Company also licenses content under arrangements where the payments are variable and based on the revenue\nearned by the Company. Since those amounts cannot be determined as of December 31, 2022, they are not included in\nthe obligations above.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\n37.7million and $ 38.0million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various\nexpiration dates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing claims, when\nit believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly\nand adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel,\nand other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal proceedings can be,\nhowever, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices, and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in litigation matters not listed herein. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, and\ninvestigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final outcome of any\nmatters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, the Company did\nnot have any loss contingencies that were material. During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded\nexpenses of $ 4.8million in Cost of revenue, device, $ 1.8million in Cost of revenue, platform, and $ 3.4million in\nGeneral and administrative expenses for claims related to patent infringement.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n92\nTable o f Contents\n14.

As a result, the Company has recorded\nadditional U.S. income tax expense of $ 3.0million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized through future operations. As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2022, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 199.2million and $ 261.8million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance, during the year ended December 31, 2022, is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in deferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and development expenses\nfor U.S. federal and conforming state purposes. The change in the valuation allowance during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in domestic net operating loss carryforwards primarily\ndue to stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of approximately $ 46.2million in deferred tax assets that\nare not realizable, related to the intellectual property transfer completed during 2021, giving rise to foreign\namortizable assets.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,959.1million and $ 1,677.7million are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2033 for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2022.\nFor Brazil, Denmark, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n8.0million, $ 1.6million, $ 23.5million, and $ 26.2million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable\nincome, if any, in those countries. Brazil, Denmark, and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward\nindefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be carried back one year and carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 188.7million and $\n134.7million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2035, respectively.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 is $ 88.0million, of which $ 71.3million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 16.7million is related to international activities.\n94\nTable o f Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022         2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              66,150    $  29,175\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        22,888       36,198\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                     -317         -330\nGross increase for tax positions of                           676        1,107\nprior years\nGross decrease for tax positions of                        -1,185            —\nprior years\nDecrease relating settlements with                           -184            —\ntaxing authorities\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              88,028    $  66,150\nof year\nAs of December 31, 2022, $ 5.3million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate and, $ 82.7million would result in an adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding\nadjustments to the valuation allowance. We do not expect our gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 0.8million and $ 0.3million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. All tax\nyears remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits include questioning the timing\nand amount of deductions; the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; and compliance with federal, state,\nand local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n15. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn November 2022, the Company approved a plan to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic\nconditions. The Company eliminated employee positions in the United States and internationally, and also abandoned\nfuture development for certain technology assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded employee termination expenses\nconsisting primarily of severance payments, notice pay (where applicable), employee benefits contributions, payroll\ntaxes and related costs, and an impairment charge related to the abandoned technology assets.\nThe restructuring charges are recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December\n31, 2022\nEmployee Terminations       Impairment Charge        Total\nResearch and development       $                 12,092    $              7,500    $  19,592\nSales and marketing                              10,904                       —       10,904\nGeneral and administrative                        7,644                       —        7,644\nTotal restructuring charges    $                 30,640    $              7,500    $  38,140\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of employee termination restructuring charges, which are\nincluded in Accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, is as follows (in thousands):\nEmployee Terminations\nBalance as of December 31, 2021                                      —\nEmployee termination restructuring charges                      30,640\nincurred\nCash payments                                                   -8,547\nBalance as of December 31, 2022               $                 22,093\nThe Company expects the plan to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2023.\n95\nTable o f Contents\n16. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. Nocontributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company contributed $\n2.3million, $ 1.3million, and $ 0.7million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively.\n17. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock and\nrestricted stock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by\napplying the treasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\nshare in the period of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                          2022                   2021                   2020\nNet income (loss)            $                  -498,005             $  242,385             $  -17,507\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                132,710                123,978\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per        $                     -3.62             $     1.83             $    -0.14\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                132,710                123,978\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                 —                  2,744                      —\nStock options                                          —                  6,214                      —\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    137,668                141,668                123,978\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per        $                     -3.62             $     1.71             $    -0.14\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect were 14.4million, 1.1million and 13.1million units of equity awards to purchase common stock\ngranted under our equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n96\nTable o f Contents\n18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the CODM for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nThe Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates performance and makes decisions about\nallocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis and\non revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the management approach to determine the\nsegment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented separately in the Company’s notes to its\nconsolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized\nthe segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nEffective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reorganized reportable segments to better align with\nmanagement’s reporting of information reviewed by the CODM for each segment. The Company’s segment and related\nfinancial information has been recast to reflect the following changes; the Company renamed the player segment to\nthe devices segment which now includes licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV partners\nin addition to sales of streaming players, audio products and smart home products. All financial information,\ncurrent and historical, has been recast based on the reorganized segments.\nUpdated descriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nThe platform segment generates revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\ndemand-side platform and content distribution services such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media\nand entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons\non remote controls.\nDevices\nThe devices segment generates revenue from the sale of streaming players, audio products, smart home products and\naccessories that are sold through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to customers through the\nCompany’s website. In addition, revenue from licensing arrangements with service operators and licensed Roku TV\npartners is now included in the devices segment.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022       2021       2020\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                            *      10  %      14  %\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                            *          *      10  %\nCustomer B                                        21  %      22  %      17  %\nCustomer C                                        38  %      35  %      39  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022          2021\nUnited States      $             686,902    $  442,012\nUnited Kingdom                   127,538        59,168\nOther countries                   42,286        22,047\nTotal              $             856,726    $  523,227\n97\nTable o f Contents",

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as\nof the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and\noperation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n98\nTable o f Contents\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 16, 2023",
