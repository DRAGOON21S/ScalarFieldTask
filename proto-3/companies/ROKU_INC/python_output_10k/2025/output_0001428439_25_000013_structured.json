          "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico by hours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV and believe that all TV will be streamed. The shift of the TV ecosystem to\nstreaming continues and is expanding TV’s capabilities for viewers, content partners, advertisers, and other\nindustry participants. Nearly every major media company not only has a streaming service, but has also expanded\nbeyond pure subscription streaming models to ad-supported streaming options. Advertisers use TV streaming to reach\nviewers who are increasingly unreachable on traditional TV, while also benefiting from the digital advertising\ncapabilities that TV streaming platforms can deliver.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nviewers, content partners, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we connect viewers to the\nentertainment they love; enable content partners to build, engage, and monetize large audiences; and provide\nadvertisers with unique capabilities to reach viewers.\nOur Strategy and Business Model\nThe foundation of our platform is the Roku TV OS, which is purpose built for TVs and powers Roku streaming devices.\nThe Roku TV OS is designed to run on low-cost hardware, which enables Roku streaming devices to be sold to\nconsumers at competitive prices. The Roku TV OS connects viewers to our streaming platform via a broadband network,\ngiving them access to a wide selection of content through an experience that is both delightful and easy to use. We\nprovide periodic updates via the Roku TV OS to continuously deliver an exceptional streaming experience.\nWe dedicate significant resources to build, maintain, and advance the Roku TV OS; to provide an industry-leading\nstreaming platform for our viewers, content partners, and advertisers; to obtain content for our streaming platform\nthat attracts viewers, including our own original programming (Roku Originals); and to extend Roku’s leadership as\nthe global shift to TV streaming continues.\nOur three-phased business model—grow scale, grow engagement, and grow monetization—drives our mission. We leverage\nour position as the TV streaming platform to help our viewers find content across the streaming universe, while\nsimultaneously growing monetization. Our three key initiatives to grow platform revenue are to innovate the Roku\nHome Screen to expand monetization, grow advertising demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, and\ngrow Roku-billed subscriptions.\nDevices Segment: Providing Easy Access to TV Streaming\nWe make TV streaming accessible to consumers through a broad lineup of devices, at a variety of competitive price\npoints. Our devices segment generates revenue from the sale of Roku streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home\nproducts and services, audio products, and related accessories.\nRoku TV models are TVs made and sold by our Roku TV partners, which are TV original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”) that license the Roku TV OS and leverage our smart TV reference designs. We have driven strong Streaming\nHousehold growth through this Roku TV licensing program, which we launched more than 10 years ago.\nIn 2023, we launched Roku-branded TVs, which are designed, made, and sold by us. This award-winning lineup includes\nthe Roku Select and Roku Plus Series TVs, and the Roku Pro Series TVs, which are our higher-performing TVs that we\nlaunched in spring 2024. Roku-branded TVs complement our successful Roku TV licensing program. We believe our Roku-\nbranded TVs will enable us to further grow our leadership position in TV streaming and compete in the higher-end\nrange of performance TVs. Roku-branded TVs will also help us innovate more quickly in all aspects of hardware and\nsoftware and test directly with viewers, improving the product and viewer experience and strengthening the entire\nRoku ecosystem.\nRoku streaming players enable users to easily turn (nearly) any TV into a smart TV. We launch new streaming player\nmodels periodically with a focus on offering high performance at an affordable price. In September 2024, we\nlaunched our most powerful streaming player to date: the 2024 Roku Ultra. This premium streaming player comes\nbundled with the Voice Remote Pro (2nd edition), our most advanced remote.\nRoku streaming devices are broadly distributed at popular national retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, CVS,\nThe Home Depot, Lowe’s, Sam’s Club, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart.\n1\nTable of Contents\nAudio is an important part of the TV streaming experience, and we offer Roku-branded wireless speakers and\nsubwoofers that seamlessly connect to TVs powered by the Roku TV OS. Additionally, Roku TV Ready allows certified\nsoundbars to quickly and easily connect to Roku TVs, enabling the use of one remote and having all the sound\nsettings uploaded to the TV. This is another example of Roku’s innovative TV ecosystem.\nThe Roku ecosystem extends beyond TV streaming and audio to smart home devices that include cameras, video\ndoorbells, lights, plugs, a home monitoring system, and our Roku Smart Home mobile application for iOS and Android.\nSimilar to our TV streaming business model, we build scale by selling Roku Smart Home devices and then monetize\nthrough smart home services. We offer subscription plans for our cameras, video doorbells, and home monitoring\nsystem.\nThrough our streaming devices and the Roku platform, we provide viewers tremendous choice, value, and an\nexceptional viewer experience. In 2024, we added 9.8 million net Streaming Households, ending the year with 89.8\nmillion Streaming Households.\nPlatform Segment: Growing and Monetizing User Engagement\nThe Roku Experience\nWe call the user experience on the Roku platform the “Roku Experience.” It represents all the features that Roku\nbuilds and operates to engage, delight, and help our viewers find great entertainment. A key competitive advantage\nthat continues to drive our success is the combination of our significant scale and the Roku Experience, which\nbegins with the Roku Home Screen. The Roku Home Screen is the first thing our viewers see when they start\nstreaming, and from this position, we can help the viewer decide what to watch every day across the vast range of\noptions available to them on our streaming platform.\nAs an example, sports is an important entertainment category for viewers and advertisers, and Roku is focused on\nbenefiting from its ongoing shift to streaming. Available from the Roku Home Screen Menu, the Roku Sports Zone\norganizes sports programming in a single location, and its features are integrated throughout the Roku Experience.\nWe partnered with the NFL to launch our first league-branded zone in 2023, and in 2024 we added zones for the NBA\nand MLB. We also have zones for college football, college basketball, and women’s sports, among others. Each zone\nhelps viewers find live and upcoming games and related content such as previews, highlights, commentary, and\ndocumentaries. In addition to sports, we build viewer experiences around popular entertainment genres like home\nimprovement and food and tentpole events like the Olympics and the Oscars.\nThe Roku Channel\nAnother top engagement driver on our streaming platform is The Roku Channel, our owned and operated streaming app.\nThe Roku Channel aggregates a broad variety of entertainment into a unified streaming experience, through three\ndistinct types of content:\nAVOD (ad-supported video on demand): Viewers can stream a broad variety of 80,000+ movies and TV shows, including\nRoku Originals, for free.\nLive TV : Viewers have access to watch 500+ FAST (free, ad-supported linear streaming TV) channels in genres\nranging from news to sports to entertainment to creator content.\nPremium Subscriptions : Viewers can easily sign up, view, and manage subscriptions to dozens of SVOD apps, such\nas Max and Paramount+, with a single, monthly bill.\nThe foundation of our content strategy for The Roku Channel is third-party licensed content and, to a smaller\nextent, our original programming, Roku Originals. Our content spend is intended to be commensurate with the growth\ntrajectory of The Roku Channel and with the broader macroeconomic environment. The Roku Channel is available on\ndevices powered by the Roku TV OS in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. In the United\nStates, it is also available via the Roku mobile app, online at TheRokuChannel.Roku.com, and on Amazon Fire TVs,\nSamsung TVs, Google TV, and other Android TV OS devices.\nOwning and operating both The Roku Channel and our streaming platform creates unique value, making us a leader in\nfree content, positioning us to be a valuable partner to content partners, and providing a large source of\nadvertising inventory. The Roku Channel benefits from its integration throughout the Roku Experience, which has\nfeatures such as Live TV, Sports, What to Watch, and more that can surface content to our viewers directly. The\nRoku Channel is a core strategic asset in our monetization efforts that simultaneously benefits viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers, while generating platform revenue.\nStreaming Hours\nWe grew Streaming Hours on the overall Roku platform from 106.0 billion hours in 2023 to 127.1 billion hours in\n2024 through increasing the distribution of Roku streaming devices, increasing our Streaming Households, and\ncontinuing to enhance the Roku Experience. We are always seeking new ways to innovate to expand the role the Roku\nExperience can play in helping viewers find what to watch, which simultaneously benefits our content partners and\nadvertisers while creating monetization opportunities for Roku.\n2\nTable of Contents\nPlatform Revenue\nOur TV streaming platform enables content partners and advertisers to reach audiences that are increasingly\nunreachable on traditional TV. Each user on our streaming platform creates multiple revenue opportunities for Roku\nthrough activities such as navigating through the Roku Experience, watching ad-supported content, or signing up for\nsubscription services.\nWe generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nWe empower viewers to choose how much they want to spend on content by offering them a broad array of free, ad-\nsupported, subscription, and transactional viewing options. Our direct relationship with customers provides us with\ninsights about their behavior on our streaming platform, including certain content viewers search for, the apps\nviewers install and watch, and the types of content that viewers purchase or subscribe to on our streaming\nplatform. This first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content recommendations to\nimprove our viewers’ experience.\nIn 2024, we added a new personalized content row powered by AI to the Roku Home Screen. Unlike suggestions from\nstreaming services, which are restricted to their libraries, our recommendations include content from streaming\napps across our platform. This content row is designed to recommend TV shows and movies to viewers while\nsimultaneously driving growth for Roku in areas such as Streaming Hours, SVOD signups, and ad reach.\nOur significant scale, ability to reach highly engaged viewers, tools that enable seamless signups, and\nmarketing/discovery features make us an attractive platform to content partners. They can also reach and engage\nthose viewers who do not use traditional TV services. As more viewers shift to TV streaming, content partners that\npublish apps on our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage viewers directly.\nWe make it easy for content partners to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary\nbusiness models: SVOD, which includes subscriptions to individual video on demand apps and so-called virtual\nmultichannel video programming distribution (“vMVPD”) services; ad-supported video, which includes AVOD apps with\non demand content that do not charge a subscription fee to users, as well as FAST; and transaction video on demand\n(“TVOD”), which includes apps that offer a la carte content purchases or rentals. Our billing service assists\ncontent partners with their billing needs, such as managing payment methods, subscriptions, and customer invoices.\nThis service also allows content partners to enable a frictionless signup within their app, and we believe this key\nbenefit simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for our content partners.\nContent partners also have access to our media and entertainment tools to help them attract, engage, and retain\nviewers by investing in promoting their content on our streaming platform. Content partners can use a variety of ad\ntypes, such as native display ads on the Roku Home Screen to drive app downloads, promote an app’s content, or\ndirect traffic to their apps in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive\nrevenue from the sale of branded app buttons on Roku remote controls that are intended to increase incremental\nusage of an app by enabling viewers to launch straight into the app from any screen. Our analytics and reporting\nassist content partners with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles, and we also can help\ncontent partners target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nJust as ads evolved decades ago when TV replaced radio as the primary entertainment medium, ads on TV streaming\noffer new and more performant opportunities than traditional TV. Advertisers are able to leverage the combination\nof our significant scale, our direct relationship with viewers, and our innovative ad products and technology to\nreach consumers with relevant messages. We offer advertisers a unique and effective set of tools to reach viewers\nand measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment.\nWe sell both in-stream video ads and display ads integrated into our user interface (“UI”). Our standard in-stream\nvideo ads are the same as the video advertising seen on traditional TV, but they are made more performant with data\nand technology. Additionally, we are able to offer a broader array of ad experiences than standard video ads, such\nas the ability to takeover an entire ad break, ads related to a specific Roku Original, and ads that appear when\nthe viewer pauses content.\nThe display ads we offer are integrated into the Roku Experience and are only possible because we are the streaming\nplatform. These differentiated ads fall into three main categories of native ads, native destinations, and action\nads. Native ads are high-visibility placements within our iconic Roku City screensaver, wallpaper-branded themes on\nthe Roku Home Screen or The Roku Channel, spotlight ads (placed directly below the Roku Home Screen Menu), or\nmarquee ads (placed directly to the right of the app tiles on the Roku Home Screen Menu) which can be either static\nor video. Native destinations include sponsorships of a playlist, zone (e.g., the Roku Sports Zone), fan experience\n(e.g., the premiere of a new TV show season), or a “pass” that provides viewers with a free movie/TV show. Action\nads can be combined with other ad types and create an easy way for viewers to use their remote to subscribe to a\nservice, purchase an item, or receive more information (e.g., OK-to-Text, OK-to-Checkout). Many of our action ads\nare in partnership with companies such as Walmart, Shopify, and Instacart that connect their products with viewers\nand provide enhanced targeting and closed-loop measurement.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRoku enables advertisers to measure TV streaming ad performance throughout the Roku Experience. Our measurement\nframework is built on a foundation of verified identity, consisting of direct relationships with viewers. We can\ncombine this asset with the advertiser’s preferred data sources to provide an expansive measurement toolkit that\nincludes reach measurement, brand resonance, and sales attribution, among others. We also have partnerships with\ncompanies such as iSpot.TV that allow advertisers to buy, optimize, and measure their campaigns, whether directly\nthrough Roku or through another buying platform.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to further differentiate our streaming platform and increase the value we deliver\nto our viewers, content partners, and advertisers. We must regularly update and enhance our streaming platform to\nmeet evolving viewer behavior and provide a best-in-class content delivery and advertising platform. We must\nprovide content partners with best-in-class publishing tools and actionable audience insights. We must continue to\ninnovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our streaming platform. We aim to balance our commitment to growing Adjusted EBITDA and Free\nCash Flow with our investments to further expand our scale, engagement, and monetization.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe continue to innovate our advertising offerings. On the Roku Home Screen, we recently enhanced our marquee ads\nfrom static display to video. This new video capability has attracted diverse brands and verticals such as tech,\nfinancial services, quick-service restaurants, retail, consumer packaged goods, and auto. This is part of our\nongoing effort to diversify display ads on the Roku Home Screen beyond media and entertainment advertisers. We are\nworking to offer video in the marquee ads to more brands, while continuing to deliver a delightful user experience.\nAs part of our efforts to grow advertising demand, we are making it easier for advertisers to execute campaigns\nprogrammatically by expanding and deepening our relationships with third-party platforms, including demand-side\nplatforms (“DSPs”), supply-side platforms (“SSPs”), retail media networks, measurement, and other strategic\npartners. The Trade Desk (“TTD”) represents our deepest integration to date with a DSP. Additionally, Roku has\nadopted Unified ID 2.0 (“UID2”), an identity solution developed by TTD, that allows advertisers to deliver more\npersonalized ad experiences across Roku’s inventory and devices at scale. We expect we will continue to integrate\nwith third-party DSPs to expand our ability to serve multiple price points, and in doing so, we expect to drive\nincremental revenue over time.\nWe have also expanded our ad offering to better serve small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”). Roku Ads Manager,\nlaunched in September 2024, is our self-service connected TV advertising solution, providing performance features\nlike advanced targeting, conversion optimization and measurement, and shoppable ad formats. This solution builds on\nour growing list of ad offerings that provide advertisers with more choices with regard to how they buy Roku Media\n– whether through direct IO (insertion order), a preferred DSP partner, or self-service. This allows us to serve a\ndiverse array of advertisers across verticals and business sizes, from SMBs to enterprise companies.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers viewers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to viewers, content\npartners, and advertisers is as compelling in international markets as it is in the United States. Today Roku\nstreaming devices are available in 15+ countries. We are the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico by hours streamed.\nInternationally, we continue to grow our footprint and deepen our presence in key markets. In Latin America, we\nannounced Roku TV models with Multi in Brazil; Kalley in Colombia; RCA in Chile; and Sharp, Caixun, and Hyundai in\nPeru. In the United Kingdom, we announced new Roku TV models with CHiQ, JVC, Veltek, and Logik and launched Roku TV\nmodels with Westinghouse. In international markets, we plan to continue to focus on building scale first,\nincreasing engagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nWe are successfully growing The Roku Channel audience internationally. The Roku Channel is available on devices\npowered by the Roku TV OS in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico remains the channel’s largest market\noutside of the United States by Streaming Households and Streaming Hours. With strong scale and engagement, we are\nworking to grow monetization in Mexico.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously grow scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content partners, advertisers, TV brands, and retailers, and\ndriving sales of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’ products to consumers through retail distribution\nchannels.\n4\nTable of Contents\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships to promote and build awareness\nof the features and advantages of our streaming platform among content partners, advertisers, and TV brands. Our\ndata science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our streaming platform to increase\neffectiveness for our content partners and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns. Our\nrelationship with content partners is typically client-direct. Through our dedicated content partner relationship\nmanagement team, we enter into agreements with content partners to distribute their apps on our streaming platform,\nor license their content for The Roku Channel, or both. As part of our distribution agreements with AVOD apps, we\ntypically secure direct access to a portion of the content partners’ video advertising inventory for our\nmonetization, and our sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content partners. Whereas\nour content partners typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large\nstreaming audience across many apps and via other Roku-branded experiences such as the Roku Home Screen at once\nusing our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across\nnumerous key performance indicators.\nWe are developing relationships with more third-party ad-buying platforms (e.g., retail media networks, DSPs, SSPs,\nand other strategic partners) to reach marketers buying programmatic advertising on such platforms and to create\nmore demand opportunities for our advertising inventory. Our ad sales teams and products are organized into groups\nthat specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii)\nindependent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content partners and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and\ndirect-to-consumer brands, and (v) international markets.\nWe work with our licensed Roku TV partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\nplanning, manufacturing, and marketing. In the United States, the majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ products are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart,\nincluding their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website\n(excluding Roku TV models). We also sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon,\nBest Buy, Walmart, and Target collectively accounted for 81% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31,\n2024 and 76% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We support retailers with an experienced\nsales management team and work closely with these retailers to assist with marketing and product mix forecasting.\nWe intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and device sales. Our revenue and\ngross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a higher\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our streaming device sales through retailers in an effort to grow our\nStreaming Households, which typically reduce our devices gross margin or results in a devices gross loss in the\nfourth quarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and outsourced development and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new TVs, players, audio\nproducts, smart home devices, features, and functionality. We work closely with content partners, advertisers, and\nlicensed Roku TV partners to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development\nprocess that seeks to take input from our partners into account when making decisions about our future product and\nservice offerings. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features and enhancements to our\nplatform. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development to bring new or improved\nproducts and services to market.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and\nother contractors and vendors. All of our products are manufactured in China, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Mexico.\nOur contracts do not obligate our partners to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecasts we establish based upon\nhistorical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The manufacturers ship\nour products to our third-party warehouses, from where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale\ndistributors, and consumers.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our products and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\n5\nTable of Contents\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprotections, often bringing enforcement actions for unfair acts or deceptive practices related to privacy and\nsecurity or other consumer protection matters. An increasing number of states have passed, or are considering,\nlegislation to govern consumer privacy or consumer protection online. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we\noperate impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United\nStates. Consumer privacy and consumer protection laws, and regulators’ interpretations of these laws, may become\nmore diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the challenges and costs associated with complying with these\nlaws in all jurisdictions. Governments in both the U.S. and other jurisdictions also have adopted, or are\nconsidering adoption, of laws and regulations intended to protect minors’ privacy and otherwise protect minors from\nperceived harms online. Privacy and other laws also may limit the ability of advertisers to fully utilize our\nplatform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet.\nOur business also is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. For example, the threat, implementation, or\nmodification of new import restrictions in the U.S., as well as any retaliatory measures adopted by affected U.S.\ntrade partners, could prove disruptive to the business environment in which we operate.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\ncertain local content quotas or production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,500 issued patents and 600 pending applications in the United\nStates and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our\nproduct offerings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business,\nsee Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on building scale by growing our user base, growing engagement by increasing the hours of content streamed\nthrough our platform, and growing the monetization of the activities that viewers engage in through our platform.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming devices and companies that license\ntheir operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs as well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\n6\nTable of Contents\nstreaming applications that enable users to stream content on phones, tablets, and laptop computers;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach viewers on other content and advertising mediums,\nincluding on other ad-supported streaming services and social media applications;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games;\ncompanies that offer products that compete with our audio products or our smart home products and services; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices or offer remote work positions that may be better\nable to attract and retain top talent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations,\nand other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects. We also compete with these same publishers in seeking to sell advertising to support the\ndistribution of streaming content. A number of leading content publishers have launched ad-supported subscription\ntiers and FAST channels, which offer consumers access to content either for free or for a lower subscription fee.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2024, we employed approximately 3,340 full-time employees located in 15 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees have adopted a\nhybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level. We\nalso emphasize integrity, transparency, and honesty in our internal and external conduct of business. All employees\nare required to comply fully with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, which sets forth our values, business\nculture, and practices.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to leverage\nour broad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions. As we grow our business, our goal is to\nensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive.\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace to spark innovation, strengthen teamwork, equip us to build\nexceptional products, and drive us to deliver the best TV streaming content. We believe our employees should feel\nrespected, valued, and empowered to contribute, collaborate, and thrive. Our Inclusion Strategy team partners\nacross Roku to implement coordinated programs that advance inclusion, supports our employee resource groups, and\ncollaborates with our Talent Acquisition team to expand our talent community and share our employer brand story. In\naddition, as a global TV streaming platform, we seek to delight our consumers through inclusive content, services,\nand partnerships that enrich the Roku Experience for our audiences everywhere. Our Inclusion Strategy and Roku\nMedia teams partner to elevate storytelling that authentically represents and resonates with audiences from\ndifferent backgrounds.\nWe seek to make purposeful investments in developing future talent across our industry through our Social Impact\nprogram. Our employees partner with nonprofits to share their expertise and provide young people with valuable\nindustry insights and hands-on experiences. We also collaborate with external organizations to connect a broad\nrange of talent with real-world opportunities in media and entertainment.\nOur Learning and Talent Development team provides our employees with the training and development needed to support\nour strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive new hire\nonboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources needed to increase our new hires’ speed to\nproductivity. In addition to required trainings, we offer employees a suite of highly encouraged offerings covering\ntopics such as high-performance feedback, career development, change management, and communication skills. Managers\nare provided with training on expectations for managers and have access to a 1:1 leadership coaching program to\nsupport new and newly promoted leaders in managing and leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access\nto on-demand technical and non-technical skill development through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to\nreview, refresh, purchase, and custom-build additional training materials to support our global employees’\nperformance and development needs.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation opportunity, we consider what that employee would be\npaid by another employer, what we would have to pay to replace that employee if the employee leaves Roku, and the\namount we would pay to retain that employee. Generally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of\nsalary and equity awards rather than offering specific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by\ndifferent employees. We generally do not pay cash bonuses (other than to employees eligible for sales commissions)\nor have performance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level.\nWe recognize that our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the\ntime and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a variety of\nbenefits and wellness offerings to our employees around the world.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable\nafter they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

differentiate our streaming platform and compete successfully with our competitors, it will be\ndifficult for us to attract and retain users and our business will be adversely impacted.\nThe TV streaming industry—including the sale of TV streaming devices as well as the sale of advertising on TV\nstreaming platforms—is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on user acquisition and retention\nand the effective monetization of our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we must respond efficiently\nto changes in user tastes and preferences and offer our users access to the content they demand on terms that they\naccept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features and functionality of our streaming\nplatform for users, content partners, and advertisers. We also must effectively support popular sources of\nstreaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, and\nYouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in the TV streaming industry.\nLarge companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with Roku streaming\ndevices and those of our licensed Roku TV partners and the Roku TV OS. Google licenses its Android operating system\nsoftware for integration into smart TVs, including those of certain of our existing TV partners, and service\nprovider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into smart TVs and sells\nAmazon-branded smart TVs. We may also face increased competition from Walmart (which makes and sells Onn. branded\nstreaming products, including co-branded Roku TV models), in light of Walmart’s recent acquisition of Vizio (which\nmakes and sells smart TVs with a proprietary operating system). These companies have greater financial resources\nthan we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements to promote their other\nproducts and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, increase\nStreaming Hours, and monetize our streaming platform. These competitors could also implement standards or\ntechnology that are not compatible with our products or that provide a better streaming experience and have greater\nresources to more aggressively promote their brands through advertising than we do.\nIn addition, we compete for Streaming Hours with many TV brands, including certain of our existing TV partners,\nthat offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs, mobile streaming applications on smartphones and\ntablets, and other devices and platforms, such as game consoles with TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some\nservice operators, such as Comcast and Charter Communications (and their joint venture, Xumo, LLC), offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing user bases,\ninstallation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in TV streaming. If\nviewers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to Roku streaming devices, we may not be able to\nachieve our expected growth in platform revenue, gross profit, and our key performance metrics.\nWe expect continued competition in TV streaming, which could result in pricing pressure, lower revenue and gross\nprofit, declines in our key performance metrics, or the failure of Roku streaming devices, our streaming platform,\nor our other products to gain or maintain broad market acceptance.\nTo remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming platform, we need to continuously invest\nin our platform, product development, marketing, service and support, and device distribution infrastructure. In\naddition, evolving TV standards and unknown future developments may require further investments in the development\nof Roku streaming devices, our streaming platform, and our other products. We may not have sufficient resources to\ncontinue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive position. In addition, many of our competitors\nhave longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater\nfinancial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which provide them with advantages in\ndeveloping, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they may be able to respond more\nquickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales, and distribution of their\nproducts or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than we can. These competitors\nmay also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and may be able to deliver\nproducts and services at a lower cost. Sustained competition could reduce our sales volume, revenue, and operating\nmargins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our business.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer Roku-branded smart home products and services, and audio products,\nincluding wireless speakers and subwoofers. As a result, we face additional competition from other brands of smart\nhome and audio products. If our smart home and audio products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku\nExperience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, which may impact the overall\ndemand for our products and our partners’ Roku TV models.\nOur competitors offer content and other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our\nstreaming platform.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, social media platforms, and other digital platforms, as well as traditional\nmedia, such as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer\ncontent and other advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These\ncompetitors are often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may\nadversely affect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from\nadvertising. Many major\n11\nTable of Contents\nSVOD services, including Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video, now have ad-supported SVOD tiers, which has\nfurther increased competition for streaming TV advertising revenue. These services, as well as other services such\nas YouTube and services that have FAST channels (such as Tubi and Pluto), sell (either through direct sales or\nprogrammatically through third parties) advertising inventory in their ad-supported content that is distributed on\nour streaming platform. Our business and growth prospects may be harmed if we are unable to increase our revenue\nfrom advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our streaming platform’s capabilities to further\noptimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns; continuing to increase our streaming platform’s reach; increasing,\ndifferentiating, and selling our advertising inventory, including video advertising inventory we sell in The Roku\nChannel, video advertising inventory that we acquire through our streaming services distribution agreements, and\ndisplay ads included throughout the Roku Experience; innovating our ad product offerings; and maintaining a strong\nadvertising sales team and programmatic capabilities. See also “— If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply\nof quality video advertising inventory on our streaming platform or generate sufficient demand to effectively sell\nour available video advertising inventory, our business may be harmed .”\nIf advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in traditional\nmedia or on other digital platforms rather than on advertising on our streaming platform, the future growth of our\nbusiness may be negatively impacted.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to advertising in\ntraditional media or on other digital platforms, such as traditional TV, radio, print publications, and social\nmedia. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of advertising on TV streaming platforms and on\nadvertisers increasing their spending on advertising on our TV streaming platform. Although traditional TV\nadvertisers have shown growing interest in advertising on TV streaming platforms, we cannot be certain that their\ninterest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to traditional TV advertising or shift their\nadvertising spending to social media and other digital platforms. In addition, if we are unable to compete with\nsocial media and other digital platforms to win business from advertisers and advertising agencies who have\ntraditionally advertised on these platforms, such as direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our\nability to grow our business may be limited. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive\nmeaningful benefits of advertising on our TV streaming platform, the market may develop more slowly than we expect,\nwhich could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nFinally, there is political or regulatory pressure in some countries to limit streaming TV advertising (including\nlimiting the advertising that may be associated with children’s content) or impose local content requirements on\nstreaming TV services, which could pose a threat to our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video advertising inventory on our streaming platform or\ngenerate sufficient demand to effectively sell our available video advertising inventory, our business may be\nharmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video advertising inventory on our streaming platform and sell it\nto advertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video advertising inventory\nfor us to sell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable\nto secure content that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a\nsufficient supply of advertising inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video advertising inventory will be\nnegatively impacted. We are also dependent on our ability to monetize video advertising inventory within other ad-\nsupported apps on our streaming platform and seek to sell such inventory from the content partners of such apps. We\nmay fail to attract content partners that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours\non our streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient supply of such advertising inventory from the\npublishers.\nOur access to video advertising inventory in ad-supported streaming apps on our streaming platform varies greatly\namong apps and the amount, quality, and cost of video advertising inventory available to us can change at any time.\nAccordingly, we may not have access to a significant portion of the video advertising inventory on our streaming\nplatform. For certain apps, including YouTube’s ad-supported app, we have no access to video advertising inventory\nat this time, and we may not secure access in the future. Moreover, when existing SVOD services introduce new ad-\nsupported tiers to their streaming services, we have in the past been unable, and in the future may be unable, to\nobtain access to video advertising inventory on these tiers on mutually agreeable terms, or at all. If we cannot\ngrow, maintain, and generate sufficient demand for an adequate supply of quality video advertising inventory at\nreasonable costs to keep up with demand or sell such advertising inventory at our desired price, our business may\nbe harmed. If we are unable to effectively sell our available video advertising inventory, our business may be\nharmed.\nIf the advertising campaigns that run on our streaming platform decrease or are not relevant or not engaging to our\nusers, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to engage with more advertisers and content partners, and\nenable them to deliver more relevant advertising campaigns to our viewers. However, a small number of content\npartners historically have accounted for a significant portion of the spending on ads integrated into our UI, and\nconsolidation among content partners has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in decreased spending\non ads integrated into our UI. If our content partners decrease spending on ads integrated into our UI, our\nfinancial condition and operating results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, existing and prospective advertisers may not be successful in serving advertising campaigns that lead\nto and maintain viewer engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive, or overly targeted and\nintrusive. For example, viewers may dislike the content and frequency of advertising that appears on the Roku Home\nScreen. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of our advertisers with our desire to provide an\noptimal viewer experience, but we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain\nviewers, advertisers, and content partners. If the advertising campaigns run on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant, are overly intrusive or too frequent, or are an impediment to the use of our platform, our viewers may\nstop using our platform, resulting in a reduction of our user base and Streaming Hours, which will harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with programmatic advertising.\nThe market for programmatic streaming TV ad buying is growing, and advertisers and advertising agencies can\nprogrammatically purchase and manage their streaming TV, desktop, and mobile advertising campaigns both off and on\nthe Roku platform through third-party demand sources (such as third-party DSPs and SSPs) and through our media\nbuying channels. If our current and potential advertising partners do not continue to shift to programmatic ad\nbuying from other buying methods, or if we are unable to expand our programmatic demand by maintaining and\ndeveloping third-party demand relationships in a way that is competitive with other advertising platforms, our\nbusiness could be harmed. In addition, if DSPs or SSPs do not have the functionality or services expected by\nadvertisers or advertising agencies, they may take their advertising spend to a non-Roku platform. We also may not\nbe able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic streaming TV advertising, which would harm our ability to\ngrow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nFurthermore, the programmatic advertising ecosystem is large, distributed, and complex, requiring us to integrate\nwith several key third-party advertising partners. Our compliance with applicable laws and regulations therefore\nmay depend in part on these partners’ commitment to handling user data with the care that we require or expect of\nthem. Because integration of our respective systems is complex and rapidly evolving, we and our partners may be\nsusceptible to breaches, failures, and other errors (whether inadvertent or intentional). We expect to encounter\nmore of these challenges and issues as the number of partners we integrate with increases.\nWe are subject to credit and payment-related risks if our advertisers, advertising agencies, or programmatic\npartners do not pay or dispute their invoices, which could harm our business.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers.\nThis credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In\naddition, typically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated\nperiod of time, regardless of whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. Further,\nwe typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While\nwe attempt to balance payment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not\nalways successful. As a result, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than\nour accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies, their advertisers, or our programmatic partners over the\noperation of our streaming platform, the terms of our agreements, or our billings for purchases made by them\nthrough our streaming platform, our DSP, or other programmatic partners. If we are unable to collect or make\nadjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In the future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such\ncontingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time. Any increase in write-offs for bad debt could have\na materially negative effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Though we have not\nexperienced significant credit losses to date, if we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on\ntime or at all, our business may be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user base and streaming activity as we\nincrease the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content partners\nthrough ad-supported content. We generate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising\n(including direct and programmatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services) and\nstreaming services distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium\nSubscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls). As such, we are seeking to expand our user\nbase and increase Streaming Hours in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user\nbase grows and as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively\nmonetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of Streaming Hours does not correlate\nwith platform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or\nevery user on our platform. Moreover, Streaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device\nis streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if our streaming player is\nconnected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps\n13\nTable of Contents\naway, or falls asleep without stopping or pausing the player, then a particular streaming app may continue to play\ncontent for a period of time determined by the streaming app. Roku TV OS’s “Are you still watching?” feature, which\nprompts users to confirm they are still watching, does not resolve this lack of correlation.\nOur ability to deliver advertisements relevant to our users and to increase our streaming platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content partners depends on the collection of user engagement data, and the degree to which our\nusers consent to, opt out of, or limit the collection or use of data for advertisements, including as a result of\nproduct changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future related to new applicable\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, regulatory actions, or litigation that impact our ability to use data for\nadvertising purposes. Content partners may also refuse to allow us to collect data regarding user engagement or\nrefuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our legal obligations or technical\nrequirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data from many of our most\npopular apps to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users.\nOther apps available on our streaming platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are\nfocused on increasing user engagement and time spent within their apps by allowing users to purchase additional\ncontent and streaming services within their apps. When users purchase these products and services, we may earn less\nrevenue than when such products and services are purchased directly from us. Additionally, if our users spend most\nof their time within particular apps where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant\nadvertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue, gross profit, or certain key\nperformance metrics. Additionally, our distribution agreements with our most popular apps are renegotiated\nperiodically; thus, even if we are currently able to monetize Streaming Hours within an app, we may not be able to\ndo so in the future. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur efforts to monetize our streaming platform may not continue to grow as we expect, and at times our platform\nrevenue growth has been, and may in the future be, lower than expected due to advertising inventory supply and\ndemand imbalances; advertisers significantly curtailing or pausing advertising spending due to macroeconomic\nfactors or other factors beyond our control; competitive pressures from video advertising offerings on other TV\nstreaming platforms or services; or the non-binding nature of advertisers’ spending commitments. For example,\nspending commitments we obtain in connection with annual TV Upfront presentations are typically not fully binding,\nand the revenue we receive from such commitments may be less than the initially committed amount. To materially\nincrease the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising, we must generate\nsignificantly more advertising revenue on our streaming platform as well as deliver ad-supported content that\nresults in our users streaming significantly more ad-supported content. We cannot assure you that we will be\nsuccessful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our operation and monetization of The Roku Channel.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television\nseries, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and expenses\nin connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize primarily\nthrough advertising. We also commission original content that we own and distribute on The Roku Channel. From time\nto time, we may remove underperforming content from The Roku Channel and record an impairment charge related to\nsuch removal.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. Our\nagreements with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make specific content\navailable through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these agreements, we must re-\nnegotiate and renew these agreements with the existing content owners, or enter into new agreements with other\ncontent owners, to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the duration of the rights previously\ngranted. If we cannot enter into content license agreements on acceptable terms to access content that enables us\nto attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel, or if the content we do secure rights\nto stream is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers, usage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our\nbusiness may be harmed. Further, even if we successfully monetize The Roku Channel in the United States, we may not\nbe successful in monetizing The Roku Channel in international markets. See also “ —We may be unable to successfully\nexpand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if implemented, will subject us to a\nvariety of risks that may harm our business. ”\nIn addition, we produce content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited\nexperience producing content, and we may not succeed in doing so in a cost-effective manner that furthers the\ngrowth of The Roku Channel and increases its appeal to our users and advertisers. We also assume risks associated\nwith content production, such as completion and key talent risks, and the risk of litigation and claims related to\nour content production.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not relevant to our users or are overly intrusive and\nimpede our users’ enjoyment of the available content, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on\nThe Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective\nfor us to operate. In addition, we distribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform,\nand we may not be successful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from\nadvertising through the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nThe sale of Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel also generates platform revenue and carries certain non-\nadvertising related risks. See “ —If our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our streaming platform\nor through other apps on our streaming platform, our business may be harmed. ”\nWe depend on a small number of content partners for a majority of our Streaming Hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content partners have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed on\nour platform. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the top three streaming services (excluding The Roku\nChannel) represented almost 50% of all hours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing apps\nthat have historically streamed a large percentage of the aggregate Streaming Hours on our platform, our Streaming\nHours, user base, or Roku streaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our streaming platform, we may fail to retain\nexisting users and attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming apps, streaming app features, and content on our platform. In order to\nremain competitive, we must consistently meet user demand for popular streaming apps, streaming app features,\nstreaming app bundles, and content, particularly as we launch new streaming devices, introduce new TVs powered by\nthe Roku TV OS, or enter new markets, including international markets. This may be challenging as the industry\ncontinues to evolve, including through consolidation of content publishers, joint ventures among content\npublishers, and licensing of content between content publishers. If we are not successful in helping our content\npublishers launch, maintain, and expand their streaming apps and streaming app features that attract and retain a\nsignificant number of users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner,\nour business will be harmed. Our success in assisting our content publishers maintain and expand their app\nofferings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our ability to effectively promote and market streaming\napps, minimize launch delays or downtime of streaming apps, and minimize streaming platform downtime and other\ntechnical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including traditional TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream\ncertain apps or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of\npopular streaming apps or content may be limited, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe non-renewal or early termination of agreements with our content partners may result in the removal of certain\napps or app features from our streaming platform and harm our streaming device sales, user base growth, and\nengagement.\nOur agreements with content partners generally have terms of one to three years and can be terminated before the\nend of the term by the content partner under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach the\nagreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content partners’ security or\nother platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and\nrenew them in order to continue providing content from these content partners on our streaming platform. We have in\nthe past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory agreement with certain content\npartners before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew such agreements on a timely basis\non mutually agreeable terms, or if a content partner terminates an agreement with us prior to its expiration, we\nmay be required to temporarily or permanently remove certain apps or app features from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such apps or app features from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business.\nMore broadly, if we fail to maintain our relationships with the content partners on terms favorable to us, or at\nall, or if these content partners face problems in delivering their content across our streaming platform, we may\nlose app partners or users and our streaming device sales, user base growth, and engagement may be harmed.\nIf our content partners do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time or choose\ndevelop their apps on alternative streaming platforms, our business may be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content partners or meet their business or technical requirements. For example, some content\npartners have elected not to participate in new Roku Home Screen Menu features or in our Roku Zones (collections of\nrelated content from apps across our streaming platform) or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their apps. See also “ —We may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user base\nand streaming activity as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which may\nharm our business. ” In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nto allow our content partners to develop and create apps on our streaming platform. Certain content partners may\nfind other languages, such\n15\nTable of Contents\nas HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their apps on other platforms. If\nkey content partners do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop apps for, do not value and\nparticipate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine that our\nsoftware developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their requirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our streaming platform or through other apps on our\nstreaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content partners activated on or through our streaming\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content partners. If users reduce their use of our streaming platform for these purchases or subscriptions\nfor any reason, including opting to pay for services directly with content partners or by other means for which we\ndo not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain apps available on our streaming platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services\nfrom within those apps. The revenue we earn from these transactions, if any, is not always equivalent to the\nrevenue we earn from sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our streaming platform. If\nusers increase their spending on such in-app transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our\nstreaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain, and expand relationships with our licensed Roku TV\npartners and manufacturing partners.\nWe license the Roku TV OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand and manufacturing partners for the\ndevelopment, manufacture, and commercialization of licensed Roku TV models and, for a number of years, the sale of\nRoku TV models by our licensed Roku TV partners has materially contributed to growth in our user base and Streaming\nHours and supported our platform monetization efforts. As our Roku TV licensing program has expanded to certain\nmarkets outside the United States, international users are representing an increasing share of our user base. We\nhave developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with these TV brand and manufacturing\npartners as we continue to invest in the growth and expansion of our Roku TV program both in the United States and\ninternational markets. We typically do not receive or expect license revenue from these license arrangements but\nincur operating expenses to establish and support them. The economic benefits that we derive from these license\narrangements are and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily growth of our user base and increasing\nStreaming Hours, and both enabling us to generate more streaming services distribution and advertising-related\nrevenue on our platform. If these arrangements do not continue to result in increased user base and Streaming\nHours, and if that growth does not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our\nbusiness may be harmed. See also “ —We may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our expanding user\nbase and streaming activity as we increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, which\nmay harm our business. ”\nThe loss of a relationship with a licensed Roku TV partner (including as a result of our launch of Roku-branded TVs\nthat are designed, made, and sold by us) could harm our results of operations, damage our reputation, increase\npricing and promotional pressures from other partners and retail distribution channels, increase our marketing\ncosts, and result in the loss of revenue. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new\nrelationships with any of these licensed Roku TV partners, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or\nother impediments to these relationships, our ability to grow or maintain our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur Roku TV licensing arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Under these license\narrangements, we generally have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources our licensing\npartners may dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our licensed Roku TV partners have failed to meet their\nforecasts and anticipated market launch dates for distributing Roku TV models, and they may fail to do so in the\nfuture. If our licensed Roku TV partners fail to meet their forecasts or launch dates for distributing our\nstreaming devices or choose to deploy competing streaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be\nharmed.\nWe and our licensed Roku TV partners depend on retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our respective\nproducts, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we or our partners\ncould experience lower product sales.\nTo continue to grow our user base, we must maintain and expand retail sales channels for our products and for the\nRoku products sold by our partners or licensees. The majority of our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Costco, Target, and Walmart,\ntheir respective online sales platforms, and traditional online retailers such as Amazon.\nWe also sell certain products directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers\nsuch as Coppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, MediaMarkt in Germany, and Currys in the United Kingdom. As we\nare still a recent entrant in international markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or\nrelationships with retailers for those markets as compared to our retail sales channels in the United States or our\ncompetitors in international markets. See also “ —We may be unable to successfully expand our international\noperations, and our international expansion plans, if implemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may\nharm our business .”\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur retailers and distributors also sell products that compete with our products and our licensed Roku TV partners’\nproducts, including house-branded televisions sold by such retailers that utilize TV operating systems other than\nthe Roku TV OS. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors, and there can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with our retailers and distributors on\nterms we find acceptable or that will be consistent with our past practices.\nWe may be reliant on certain retailers or distributors. Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart in total accounted\nfor 81% and 76% of our devices revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Furthermore,\nour licensed Roku TV partners may be reliant on the same or other retailers and distributors for a significant\nportion of their unit sales of Roku TV models. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue\nselling our or licensed Roku TV partners’ products, choose not to prominently display those products in their\nstores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations, the volume of\nour or our licensed Roku TV partners’ products sold could decrease, which would harm our business. These risks may\nbe exacerbated by our reliance on certain retailers or distributors, or when a major retailer in a jurisdiction\ncommercializes televisions under brands that the retailer controls.\nIn addition, if any of our existing licensed Roku TV partners choose to work exclusively with, or divert a\nsignificant portion of their business with us, to other operating system developers, this may adversely impact our\nability to continue to license the Roku TV OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and to grow our user\nbase and monetize the Roku TV OS. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in their stores and\nlimited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement space. Competition\nis intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger brand identity, and\ngreater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices, smart TVs, and smart\nhome devices, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to\noffer or promote our products on its website. We also may face increased competition with Walmart (which currently\nmakes and sells Onn. branded streaming products, including co-branded Roku TV models), in light of Walmart’s recent\nacquisition of Vizio (which also makes and sells smart TVs with a proprietary operating system). See also “ —If our\nefforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may not be\nable to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed ” and “ —If we fail to differentiate our streaming\nplatform and compete successfully with our competitors, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users and\nour business will be adversely impacted. ” Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our products, or\nincreased competition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing or other\nexpenditures to maintain our product visibility or could result in reduced visibility for our products, which may\nharm our business. In particular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the\nholiday season, is critical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our products during\nthese periods, our business would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor, and our\nbrand may be negatively impacted by factors, some which are beyond our control, such as the quality and reliability\nof the Roku TV models made by our licensed Roku TV partners and the quality of the content provided by our content\npartners. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and consumer demand for their\nproducts more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may have\ngreater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital advertising,\nor website product placement. See also “ —If we fail to differentiate our streaming platform and compete\nsuccessfully with our competitors, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users and our business will be\nadversely impacted.” If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be difficult to differentiate\nour business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, which may adversely affect our ability\nto attract and retain users and harm our business.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from a wide variety of apps, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content partners. While we have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is\nunlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-party rights, among other things, we may distribute apps\nthat include controversial content. Controversies related to the content included on certain apps that we\ndistribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in, negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation\nand brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nIf we encounter problems with the limited number of contract manufacturers we primarily depend upon, our operations\ncould be disrupted.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among\nother issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\n17\nTable of Contents\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions, delays, or increased costs, including from labor disputes,\nstrikes, mechanical issues, quality control issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and public health\ncrises; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new products.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our products to our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component\nshortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems in the past have impaired, and could in the\nfuture impair, the retail distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in\nour contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our products to our\nretailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers and other contractors to perform some of the development work on our\nproducts. The contract manufacturers or other contractors may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete\ndesired development or fix defects or errors in a timely manner. Delays in development work by contract\nmanufacturers or contractors could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs increase because\nof inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import restrictions, or if they\ndecide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or terminated, and we would\nhave to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract manufacturers.\nAlternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy\nour production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance standards on a timely\nbasis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would reduce our\nrevenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our devices gross margin.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities, and the facilities of our contract manufacturers’ suppliers,\nare located in various geographic areas that may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, public health,\nsocial, and legal uncertainties, including Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Brazil, and such uncertainties may harm or\ndisrupt our relationships with these parties or their ability to perform. For example, if the tensions between\nTaiwan and China escalate and impact the operations of our contract manufacturers and their Taiwanese suppliers,\nour supply chain and our business could be adversely affected. We believe that the international location of these\nfacilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on\nexports or imports.\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our licensed Roku TV partners encounter problems\nwith their internal operations or with their contract manufacturers, assemblers, or component suppliers.\nSome of our licensed Roku TV partners have internal manufacturing capabilities, while others rely primarily or\nexclusively upon contract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that our licensed Roku TV partners sell to\nretailers. Regardless of whether their manufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our licensed Roku TV\npartners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in\ntariffs on imports of Roku TV models; future possible changes in regulations on exports; restrictions, by the\nUnited States or otherwise, on dealings with certain countries, companies, or imported inputs; tariffs on parts or\ncomponents for Roku TV models; and supply chain disruptions, increased shipping costs, and shipping delays.\nOur licensed Roku TV partners’ control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply, may be limited. For those licensed Roku TV partners with contract manufacturers or\nsuppliers, the problems are exacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the licensed Roku\nTV partner does not have direct visibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the manufacture or distribution of Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors or increases in the pricing of Roku TV\nmodels at times have negatively affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the volume of Roku TV models\nsold at retail, resulting in slower user base and Streaming Hours growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing, design, or other issues affecting the quality or performance of Roku TV models\ncould harm our brand and our business.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements for our products and manage our inventory with our\ncontract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nproducts are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and components many\nmonths in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess\ncomponents and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components or\nbuild excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In the past, we have\nagreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a result of our\ndecision to discontinue a certain model or the use of particular components. If we incur costs to cover excess\nsupply commitments, our business may be harmed.\nConversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate material\nor component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products, result in insufficient quantities\navailable to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In\naddition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship\nour products via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our devices gross\nmargin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year holidays). If we fail to accurately\nforecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nobtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to\nour retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our products. For example, each of our streaming players\nand TVs powered by the Roku TV OS may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi\nfront-end module, each of which may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a\nsecond source.\nAlthough this approach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering\ndevelopment and qualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also\ncreates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or\nmaterial supply issues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other\nexport or import restrictions on parts or components for finished products that are used in final assembly of their\ncomponents (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages of key components.\nThere is also a risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations, be acquired\nby or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put contract manufacturers on\nallocation because of semiconductor shortages, or become subject to U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control\nrestrictions or penalties. Such suppliers have experienced, and may in the future experience, production, shipping,\nor logistical constraints arising from macroeconomic conditions or other circumstances, such as inflationary\npressures, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain disruptions. Such interruptions and delays have in the past and\nmay in the future force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not always be available,\nand which may cause us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching from a sole-source\nsupplier may require that we adapt our software and redesign our products to accommodate new chips and components,\nand may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to: supplier\ncapacity constraints; price increases, including those related to inflationary pressures, tariffs, and material\ncosts; timely delivery; component quality; and delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for\ncomponents and technologies. Any interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could\nadversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost\nsales and higher expenses, and harm our business.\nIf our products do not operate effectively with various offerings, technologies, and systems from content partners\nand other third parties that we do not control, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku TV OS is designed to perform using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth via\nRoku streaming devices offered at a low cost to users. However, this hardware must be interoperable with all apps\nand other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners, including virtual multi-channel video\nprogramming distributors, and other third parties. We have no control over these offerings, technologies, and\nsystems beyond our app certification requirements, and if Roku streaming devices do not provide our users with a\nhigh-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are made to those offerings that\nare not compatible\n19\nTable of Contents\nwith Roku streaming devices, we may be unable to increase user base growth and user engagement or may be required\nto increase our hardware costs, and our business will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, including, for example, the Roku-branded TVs we launched\nin 2023 and 2024, and we have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function well with these\nofferings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our largest content partners have the right to test and\ncertify our new products before we can publish their apps. The certification processes can be time-consuming and\nintroduce third-party dependencies into our product release cycles. If our content partners do not certify new\nproducts on a timely basis or require us to make changes in order to obtain certifications, our product release\nplans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able to offer certain products to all licensed Roku TV partners or\nwe may not continue to offer certain apps. To continue to grow our user base and user engagement, we will need to\nprioritize development of Roku streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies, and systems. If\nwe are unable to maintain consistent operability of Roku streaming devices that is on parity with or better than\nother platforms, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content partners may impact the\naccessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of Roku streaming devices. We may not\nsuccessfully develop Roku streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings, technologies, or\nsystems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings, technologies, or systems,\nour business could be harmed.\nOur products are complex and may contain hardware defects and software errors, which could manifest themselves in\nways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur products and the products of our licensed Roku TV partners are complex and have in the past contained, and may\nin the future contain, hardware defects or software errors. These defects and errors can manifest themselves in any\nnumber of ways in our products or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security\nvulnerabilities, data loss or poor quality, device malfunctions, account inactivity, or even permanently disabled\nproducts. Some errors may only be discovered after a product has been shipped and used by users and may in some\ncases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We update our software on a regular\nbasis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce software errors in the process of any such\nupdate.\nThe introduction of a serious software error could result in products becoming permanently disabled. We offer a\nlimited warranty for our products, in accordance with applicable law, however, providing software updates, product\nsupport, and other activities could cause us to be responsible for issues with products for an extended period of\ntime. Any defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in\nrevenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service costs, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims for product or information\nliability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In addition, our contracts with\nour end users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be\nupheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely\naffect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate\nor future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects that were unknown\nto us or over which we have no control and may render our products permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they\ncould cause our products to fail and could render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by\nwhich our users connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network\nrouter. If the Wi-Fi receiver or transmitter in a player fails and cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access\npoint, the player will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to\nrecall and replace defective products, which could be at a considerable expense. In addition, if our insurance\ncoverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be\nharmed. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the market could also be adversely\naffected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary or desirable licenses, certifications, or approvals related to our\nuse or support of third-party technology, intellectual property, or services then our ability to develop and\nintroduce new products and services, and continue to manufacture, update, and commercialize existing products and\nservices, may be impaired.\nWe use or enable in our products and services certain industry standard and other technology, intellectual\nproperty, and services that are obtained from third parties. In order to continue to make, distribute, update, and\ncommercialize existing products and services and introduce and commercialize new products and services that use a\nthird-party technology, we may be required to maintain certain licenses, certifications, and approvals from the\nrelevant third parties. The licenses, certifications, and approvals we need to obtain may be or become unavailable\nto us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain necessary third-party\nlicenses, certifications, or approvals, we may have to obtain substitute technologies, intellectual property, or\nservices with lower\n20\nTable of Contents\nquality or performance standards, or at a greater cost, or remove desired functions and features from our products\nand services, any of which could harm customer and partner relationships, as well as the competitiveness of our\nproducts, services, and business.\nOur products and services are designed to be compatible with numerous industry standards. In many cases, these\nindustry standards have numerous associated patents known generally as standard essential patents (“SEPs”). Over\ntime, SEP owners have increasingly turned away from licensing their SEPs through patent pools, preferring to\nlicense their portfolios directly. This has increased the number of licensors (since the patents are not pooled)\nand increased the time, cost, and difficulty of SEP licensing. If we are unable to obtain a license to a necessary\nSEP on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or find a suitable substitute technology that complies with the\nindustry standard, our customer and partner relationships, as well as the competitiveness of our products and\nservices, and our business may be harmed. See also “ —We must continue to innovate and develop new and existing\nproducts and services to remain competitive, and new products and services expose our business to new risks. ”\nWe must continue to innovate and develop new and existing products and services to remain competitive, and new\nproducts and services expose our business to new risks.\nWe must continually innovate and improve our products and services and develop new products and services to meet\nchanging consumer demands. The introduction of a new product or service is a complex process, involving significant\nexpenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development, and can expose our business to\nnew risks. The introduction of new products and services or changes to our existing products and services may\nresult in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new litigation or claims, or other complications\nthat could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. In addition, our entrance into entirely\nnew lines of business beyond our historical core business of TV streaming and advertising, such as our Roku-branded\nsmart home products, may change our risk profile and subject us to risks that differ from the risks we face as a\nresult of our historical TV streaming business.\nWhether users will broadly adopt our new products or services is not certain. Our future success will depend on our\nability to develop new and competitively priced products and services and add new desirable content and features to\nour streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, and we must secure production orders for new products from our contract manufacturers. See also “ —If\npopular or new content publishers do not publish content on our streaming platform, we may fail to retain existing\nusers and attract new users. ”\nThe successful development and introduction of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing or security issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with appropriate manufacturers;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our products, produce quality products,\nand minimize defects, manufacturing mishaps, shipping costs, and delays;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments;\nour ability to comply with regulatory requirements; and\nour ability to attract and retain high quality research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or services\nin a timely or cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed. We do not expect that all of our new products\nand services will be successful.\nWe are incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and services, which may present operational and\nreputational risks.\nWe have incorporated and intend to continue to incorporate AI technologies, such as generative AI, into our\nproducts and services. For example, we have introduced a generative-driven ad creation service for our advertisers\nto help them create ads more easily, and we continue to use AI technologies to power our content recommendation\nengine and our content row on the Roku Home Screen. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that\ncould adversely impact our business. AI technologies can create accuracy issues, unintended biases, and\ndiscriminatory outcomes, or may create content that appears correct but is inaccurate or flawed. If the\nrecommendations, content, or analyses that AI applications produce are or are alleged to be deficient or\ninaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the\nareas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. For example, there is uncertainty\naround the validity and enforceability of\n21\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Compliance with\nnew or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and\nmay limit our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. See also “ —If government regulations or laws\nrelating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the\nmanner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed. ” There can be no assurance that the\nmeasures we have taken to mitigate the potential risks related to generative AI will be sufficient. Failure to\nappropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and\nreputational harm.\nIf we fail to provide adequate levels of quality customer support, we could lose users, advertisers, content\npartners, and licensed Roku TV partners, which could harm our business.\nA high level of support is critical for the success of our business, and our users depend on this support to\nresolve issues relating to our products and our streaming platform. We currently outsource the majority of our\ncustomer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end users and\nlicensees. If we do not effectively train, update, and manage our third-party customer support organization to\nassist our users and licensees, and if that support organization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve\nissues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to monetize our streaming\nplatform, to sell our products to users and could harm our reputation with potential new customers and our\nlicensees.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in certain prior\nquarters, we may continue to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve profitability\nagain in the near term or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we\nachieved profitability in certain prior quarters, we may not be able to achieve profitability again in the near\nterm or at all. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,427.0 million. Our operating expenses\nhave increased in the past and may increase again in the future as we expand our operations and invest in growth\nand new areas. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may\nnot be able to achieve profitability again. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of\nreasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may\nencounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may\nresult in losses in future periods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, key performance metrics, and other operating results could vary significantly from\nquarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors,\nincluding many factors that are outside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our\noperating results and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services;\nour ability to retain and grow our user base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and monetize our\nstreaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to competitive market conditions or other\nmacroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes, inflation, or tariffs, and our ability to control costs, including\nour operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our platform and advertiser demand for such inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or product sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, apps, or features;\nthe addition or removal of content or apps from our streaming platform;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our products or partner-branded products;\ndelays in delivery of our products or partner-branded products, or disruptions in our or our partners’ supply or\ndistribution chains; and\nan increase in legal costs, including costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending\nagainst intellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to intellectual property.\nSee also “—The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value\nof our Class A common stock may decline.”\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our devices segment experienced negative gross\nmargin for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our platform segment experienced positive gross margin for the\nyear\n22\nTable of Contents\nended December 31, 2024. Gross margins on our streaming devices vary across models and can change over time as a\nresult of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, device returns, and other cost\nfluctuations.\nIn addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or retail sales channel mix, component cost increases, price\ncompetition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or\nreduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically reduce our devices gross margin or record\nnegative gross margin on devices in an effort to grow our user base and gross profit.\nAs a result, our devices segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has in the past, or at all, and, unless\nwe are able to continue to increase our platform segment revenue and grow our user base, we may be unable to grow\ngross profit and our business will be harmed. For example, from time to time, global supply chain disruptions have\nresulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices,\nwhich negatively affected our devices gross margin. If a reduction in devices gross margin does not result in an\nincrease in our user base or an increase in our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may\nsuffer, and our business may be harmed. In addition, our platform segment has experienced in the past, and may\nexperience in the future, lower gross margins than we anticipate. If our platform gross margins are lower than we\nanticipate, our financial results may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing,\nsupport services, operations, and general and administrative functions, and we may expand certain of these\nactivities in the future. Our historical growth has placed, and any future growth will continue to place,\nsignificant demands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our products;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nexpand our product offerings;\nsupport our licensed Roku TV partners;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our streaming platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including if we grow our business too rapidly, we may not be able to\nexecute our business strategies, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have previously undertaken restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and manage our operating\nexpenses, and we may do so again in the future. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, material costs and\ncharges in connection with restructuring plans and initiatives, and there can be no assurance that any\nrestructuring plans and initiatives will be successful. Any restructuring plans may adversely affect our internal\nprograms and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity,\nloss of accumulated knowledge, or inefficiency during transitional periods, may require a significant amount of\nemployees’ time and focus, and may be distracting to employees, which may divert attention from operating and\ngrowing our business. For more information, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\nof this Annual Report.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or are unable to manage our\ngrowth and expansion plans effectively, which may be impacted by factors outside of our control, our business,\noperating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our products and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our products and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our competitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering, have\ngreater experience managing a global organization, and have greater resources.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering and evolving legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations\npertaining to data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade (including tariffs,\nquotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content restrictions, AI\ntechnologies, intellectual property, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\nexposure to increased corruption risk and compliance with laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK\nBribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws\nrequiring the maintenance of accurate books and records and a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures, including as a result of competition with other devices that consumers\nmay use to stream TV or existing local traditional TV services and products, including those provided by incumbent\nTV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing Roku streaming devices and our streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming apps or content to users in certain international\nmarkets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest, or economic instability, including due to pandemics,\nnatural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine), tariffs,\ntrade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions (such as the tension between China and\nTaiwan and the tension in the Middle East), long-term environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, such as in the event that the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties or the moratorium is applied\nonly among WTO member states that support a new e-commerce agreement;\npandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, changes in the use\nof our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell our products to supply such\nservices to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, which may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk (see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange\nRate Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report);\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIn addition, we may face challenges in successfully deploying our three-phased business model—grow scale, grow\nengagement, and grow monetization—in international markets. Even if we are able to increase our user base in\ninternational markets, we may be unable to effectively grow our Streaming Hours or monetize user activity in those\nmarkets. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality and other potential fluctuations, and if our sales during\nthe affected periods fall below our expectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonality and certain one-time events significantly affect our business. For example, our revenue and gross\nprofit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and\nincreased advertising during holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we\nrecognize significant discounts in the average selling prices of our products through retailers in an effort to\ngrow our user base, which typically reduce our devices gross margin in the fourth quarter. Additionally, certain\nother events have in the past, and may in the future, impact the amount of advertising spending on our platform.\nGiven the seasonal and often irregular nature of advertising and our product sales, as well as other potential\nfluctuations, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that such impact on revenue and\ngross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in expected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the\neffectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our competitors, reductions in consumer discretionary\nspending, curtailed advertising spending, disruptions in our supply or distribution chains, tariffs or other\nrestrictions on trade, increased shipping costs,\n24\nTable of Contents\nshipping or air freight delays, or for any other reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer\nsignificantly. For example, delays or disruptions at U.S. ports of entry have in the past, and may in the future,\nadversely affect our or our licensed Roku TV partners’ ability to timely deliver products to retailers during\nholiday seasons.\nA substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nbenefits) and facilities-related, none of which are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue\nshortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the negative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in\nthe short term, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall management,\nas well as the continued development of our products and streaming platform, our culture, and our strategic\ndirection. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key personnel. The\nloss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable successor to a key\nrole could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, workforce participation rates, and unstable political conditions. Our\nemployees, particularly engineers and other product developers, are in demand, and we devote significant resources\nto identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. To attract top talent,\nwe generally offer competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In\naddition, some companies offer a remote or hybrid work environment, which may increase the competition for\nemployees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we have in the past and\nmay in the future need to increase our employee compensation levels or other benefits in response to competition\nand other business and macroeconomic factors. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled\nemployees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\npast or any additional workforce reductions could harm employee morale and negatively impact employee recruiting\nand retention.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, licensed Roku TV partners,\nand other licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex.\nTo manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and\nfinancial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content partners, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, licensed Roku TV partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in\nerrors in our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions involving a number of risks, which could harm our business if not successfully\naddressed.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions may require the expenditure of cash, dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the incurrence of\ndebt, which could adversely affect our operating results, result in unfavorable accounting treatment, and expose us\nto claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims. Acquisitions may not generate\nsufficient financial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions.\nIn addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen\noperating difficulties and expenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies\ninvolve areas of operation in which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products,\nor technologies in international markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of\noperations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at\nall, without incurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address\nsuch risks successfully, our business could be harmed.\nOur credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and\ncontains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or\notherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among us, as borrower,\ncertain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and Citibank N.A., as\nadministrative agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $300.0 million, and (ii) an uncommitted increase option of up to an additional $300.0\nmillion exercisable upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The Credit Agreement provides for a\n$100.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit, and certain existing letters of credit were\ndeemed outstanding under this facility. The Credit Agreement will mature on September 16, 2029. Proceeds from the\nCredit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance working capital requirements. As\nof December 31, 2024, we had not borrowed against the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio\nand a maximum total net leverage ratio, as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which could\nresult in amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement becoming due and payable and remaining commitments terminated\nprior to the initial termination date on September 16, 2029. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, impose restrictions, subject to certain\nexceptions, on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments, asset dispositions, restricted payments,\ndividends and distributions, prepayment of other indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, restrictive\nagreements, amendments of material documents, and the abandonment of intellectual property. The obligations under\nthe Credit Agreement, along with certain swap and banking services obligations, are secured by substantially all\nthe assets of us and our subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, except for certain customary\nexcluded assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, fail to make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other\nevent of default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give\nit the right to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding,\ntogether with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would\nhave the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If any\nfuture outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to\nsell sufficient assets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhance our streaming\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our products and streaming\nplatform, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features, products, the\nhiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic\nconditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur Credit Agreement matures on September 16, 2029. While we may enter into a new credit agreement in the future,\nwe currently have no other committed source of financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on\nterms favorable to us. Any future credit agreements we may enter into could require a lien on our assets or contain\nfinancial covenants and other restrictions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect\nour financial condition. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us\nwhen we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges\ncould be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nWe maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial\ninstitutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the\nFDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not\ninsured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited\nliquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns\nor rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed\nand was taken into receivership by the FDIC. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or\ncredit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity\nand financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable\ninsurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial\ninstitution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government\ninstitutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties can adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties, such as inflation, slow growth or recession, higher interest rates, financial and\ncredit market fluctuations, changes in economic or government policies (such as tariffs), bank failures, labor\ndisputes, and global supply chain constraints have, and may in the future, adversely impact consumer confidence and\nspending and materially adversely affect many aspects of our business.\nOur business is dependent on consumer discretionary spending and advertising spending, both of which are\nsusceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties. Sustained inflation, an economic downturn, or\nthe impact of tariffs, have in the past and may in the future result in fewer consumer purchases of our products or\nthe products of our licensed Roku TV partners and reduced advertising spending. At times, advertising budgets in a\nvariety of industries have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and market\nuncertainty, which has led to reduced advertiser spending and adversely affected our platform revenue. Any pullback\nin consumer discretionary spending or advertising spending could adversely affect our future operating results.\nIn addition, a significant reduction in the supply of original entertainment content, including as a result of\nmacroeconomic factors or labor disputes (such as the 2023 strikes called by the Writers Guild of America and\nSAG‐AFTRA), could in turn reduce the demand for advertising on our platform, and have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, operating results, and key performance metrics.\nThe extent to which macroeconomic uncertainties may impact our operational and financial performance is uncertain\nand will depend on many factors outside our control. These direct and indirect impacts may negatively affect our\nbusiness and operating results.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or other natural or man-made catastrophic events could disrupt and\nimpact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cybersecurity attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East), terrorist attack and other geopolitical\nconflicts (such as Yemen’s Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, or potential retaliatory actions from foreign governments\nin response to the current U.S. Administration’s actions), medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19\npandemic), government shutdown orders, other man-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our,\nour business partners’ and customers’ business operations or result in disruptions in the broader global economic\nenvironment. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to\nfully resume operations.\nIn particular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. For\nexample, a recent earthquake damaged equipment in our Taiwan office, and the losses, while relatively minor, were\nnot covered by our insurance.\nIn addition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and licensed Roku TV\npartners, could be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\nwildfires, and increased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California,\nincreasing intensity of\n27\nTable of Contents\ndrought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages. Further, acts of\nterrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.\nIf our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event,\nour ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the\noperations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or licensed Roku TV partners as a result of a disaster or\nother catastrophic event could delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or the products of our licensed\nRoku TV partners, which could impact our business. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a natural disaster or other catastrophic event and to\nexecute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or catastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nData security incidents, including cybersecurity attacks, or other significant disruptions of our information\ntechnology systems could harm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely\naffect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of\nour business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal, and other\ninformation, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card information, user\nvideo and audio recordings, other user information, employee information, and other confidential information. It is\ncritical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such\ninformation. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-\ncertifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\npersonal information in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as\npart of an information security program, and complying with requirements regarding the use or cross-border transfer\nof such personal information. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our business\npartners, our users, and other stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential\nusers. Data protection laws around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and\norganizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and\nevolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or\nreasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in\naccordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies. In\naddition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a data security incident,\nand any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our network infrastructure to\nthe satisfaction of our users, business partners, regulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our\nreputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users, as well as adversely affect our business\noperations and result in substantial costs. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, our\nbusiness partners, our users, and other stakeholders and impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and\npotential users.\nWe have outsourced or may outsource certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information\ntechnology infrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects,\nprocesses, transmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information and\nuser video and audio recordings), and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who\nmay or could have access to our information technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our\nconfidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their\nresponsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of\nthird parties that are involved in or have access to those systems, are very large and complex. Technology system\ndisruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters,\nterrorism, war, foreign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material\ndisruption of our product development and our business operations. Significant disruptions of our third-party\nvendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could also\nadversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or\ndisclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or personal information, which could harm our business.\nThe size, complexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the large\namounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to unintentional\nor malicious, internal, and external threats. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we\nmay be a particularly attractive target for threat actors. The risk of harm to our business caused by security\nincidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings and as we enter new markets.\nVulnerabilities can be, and have been, exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-\nparty vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Open-source software, which may be incorporated\ninto our systems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which\nwe are not aware and which we cannot control or\n28\nTable of Contents\nfully mitigate. Moreover, AI technologies may be used to implement certain cybersecurity attacks or to increase\ntheir intensity, which may further increase risk. While we have processes in place to mitigate the risks related to\nthese vulnerabilities, these measures may not be adequately designed or implemented to ensure that our operations\nare not disrupted, our reputation is not harmed, or that we will not be impacted by ransomware, cybersecurity\nattacks, or other vulnerabilities in the future. For example, despite our efforts to secure our information\ntechnology systems and the data contained in those systems, we and our third-party vendors and business partners\nhave experienced, and remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including ransomware, phishing attacks, bot\nattacks, credential stuffing attacks, improper employee access of confidential data, and inadvertent employee\ndisclosure of confidential data. There is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data\nsecurity incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a\ndata security incident that we have not discovered, we note that attackers continue to advance the ways they\nconceal their unauthorized access to systems.\nMalicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication, and intensity, and are\nbeing conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but\nnot limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation\nstates, and others. The geopolitical conflicts stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the current unrest\nin the Middle East have increased the risk of malicious attacks on information technology operations globally,\nincluding for companies headquartered in the United States, that could materially disrupt our systems and\noperations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and distribute our devices and services. Any attempts by\nthreat actors to disrupt our streaming platform, streaming devices, smart home products, website, computer systems,\nor mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm\nto our systems and operations, damage our reputation, and could result in contractual damages, litigation,\ngovernmental inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, and regulatory notification requirements, fines,\nand penalties that could harm our business. For example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data,\nwe may be subject to substantial penalties for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security\nrequirements of the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to\nprotect cardholder data. Penalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be\nimposed by various entities within the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally\nmandated framework. Such enforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business\nwith, and our third-party payment processors.\nMost of our employees have a hybrid work schedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home).\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols, the actions of our employees while working from home may\nhave a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of\ncompromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from employees’ combined use of personal and\nprivate devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to\ntransmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nThe limitations of liability in our contracts related to our information technology systems may not be enforceable\nor adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. While we maintain insurance policies to cover\ncertain losses relating to our information technology systems, there may be exceptions. Security incidents or\ncertain aspects of security incidents may not be fully covered by our insurance policies or covered at all.\nAdditionally, insurance policies will not protect against the reputational harms caused by a major security\nincident. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance\ncoverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large\ndeductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, we cannot be sure\nthat our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, transmit, disclose, and store personal information,\nwhich creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe and our service providers and partners collect, process, disclose, and store personal information of\nindividuals. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may\nstore or process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Various federal, state, and\nforeign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations govern the collection,\nprocessing, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, and storage of such personal\ninformation. These regulatory requirements are evolving, and data privacy compliance is an area of increasing\nscrutiny for privacy and consumer rights groups and government bodies. For example, in addition to the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção\nde Dados, various U.S. states have enacted broad-based privacy and data protection legislation, including\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon,\nTexas, Utah, and Virginia, and more states are expected to follow suit.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. We continue to monitor the\nimplementation, enforcement, interpretation, and evolution of these laws and regulations, but they are still\nrapidly evolving and, as a result, their application, interpretation, and enforcement are uncertain, and they may\nbe interpreted and applied inconsistently with our current policies and practices. In such event, we may be subject\nto significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions on personal information processing) or claims for damages\nfrom private litigants, or we\n29\nTable of Contents\nmay be required to make changes to our policies and operations, including the manner in which we provide our\nservices or use our user data, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe continue to assess the available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions on international\ndata transfer compliance for companies. As part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data\ntransfer mechanisms to provide for the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area or the\nUnited Kingdom to the United States. We have joined the EU, Swiss, and UK Data Privacy Framework programs to\nfacilitate transfers of non-HR personal data to the United States from these jurisdictions. Our ability to continue\nto transfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to\nincreased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating\ndisruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future. In addition, some countries are considering\nor have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data regarding users in their respective countries be\nmaintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries. Maintaining local data centers in individual\ncountries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nWe, our service providers and partners use tracking technologies to collect information about users’ interactions\nwith our platform, devices, websites, apps, and partners’ digital properties, and deliver advertising and\npersonalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners. To personalize content and advertisements\neffectively, we must leverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. The U.S. federal government,\nU.S. states, and foreign governments have enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could\nsignificantly restrict us and other advertising industry participants’ ability to collect, use, retain, and\ndisclose personal information. For example, some of these laws and regulations may require more explicit consumer\nnotice and consent for using tracking technology or collecting sensitive personal information, restrict disclosure\nof personal information between companies, or grant consumers the right to delete or limit the collection and use\nof their personal information. Our ability to collect, use and retain such data could also be further restricted by\nour agreements with advertisers and content partners.\nAny restrictions on our ability to collect, use, or retain data is likely to increase the number of users to whom\nwe cannot serve targeted advertising, which could make our platform less attractive to advertisers and partners,\nand harm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on effective delivery of\nadvertising campaigns. We are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed privacy and data protection laws\non our business.\nAny significant disruption in our information technology systems or those of third parties we utilize in our\noperations could result in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams as well as the teams of our service\nproviders and partners for the performance and operation of the Roku TV OS, streaming platform, smart home\nproducts, and other information technology systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of information technology systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness\nof our products and streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We\nutilize information technology systems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting\nproviders and third-party internet-based or cloud computing services. Although we generally enter into service\nlevel agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over their operations, which makes us vulnerable to any\nerrors, interruptions, or delays that they may experience.\nUpon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace\ntheir services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable\nto us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies\nuntil the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, foreign invasions, terrorist\nactivity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events could damage these systems and\nhardware or cause them to fail completely.\nAs we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations, products, or services, could result in liabilities to our customers or third parties, and could\nadversely affect our business. Our property insurance and cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to fully\ncover our losses or may not cover a particular event at all. Any disruption in the services provided by these\nvendors could have adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our information technology systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails,\nit may lead to downtime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We\nexpect to continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and\nplatform performance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address\ncapacity constraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network\narchitecture to accommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual\nand anticipated changes in technology, our business may be harmed.\n30\nTable of Contents\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as well as their continued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected\nnature of the internet. We exercise no control over network operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors,\ndisruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as any decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of\ncertain network traffic at the expense of other traffic. Any material disruption or degradation in internet\nservices could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, zero rating of competing services by\nISPs, and traffic “shaping” or throttling, that could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of\nwhich could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide users with access to the internet also offer users multichannel\nvideo programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators have an\nincentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other\ncompanies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide\npreferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our\nproducts and streaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us and may seek to challenge\nthe validity or enforceability of our own patents and patents applications. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been and is expected to be substantial. Some of our competitors may\nbe better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater\nfinancial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and\ndivert management’s attention from our other business concerns or otherwise adversely affect our business and\noperating results. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other\nproceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nharm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all, thereby hindering our ability to sell or use the relevant technology or requiring redesign of the\nallegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time‐consuming, or impossible. Even if\nwe are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and\nthe rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to gain access to the same\nintellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property licenses may not include\nrights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the scope of the licenses\ngranted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us and our licensees.\nFurthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making,\nlicensing, using, or importing technologies or products that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties. For example, we have in the past elected\nto develop and implement specific design changes to address potential risks that certain products could otherwise\nbecome subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from patent infringement and other intellectual\nproperty claims brought to the U.S. International Trade Commission. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology.\nHowever, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop\nour intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our\nagreements will not be breached. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach\nthat agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to\ndiscover such breaches, and if we do, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We cannot\nguarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that\ncompetitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent\ninformation and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim\nthat a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming, and could result\nin substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft, counterfeiting, or unauthorized reverse\nengineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing\nprocesses, data sets, or other sensitive information.\nOur efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to\nprevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including\nbusiness decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our\nbusiness. We have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be\ninnovative. There is no guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the\nprotection gained will be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nU.S. patent laws, and the scope of coverage afforded by them, have been subject to significant changes, such as the\nchange to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in\nthe determination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Foreign patent laws may also continue to develop and significantly impact our ability\nto protect or maintain our intellectual property. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant\nimpact on our ability to protect the innovations contained within our products and platform and could harm our\nbusiness.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Despite the cost and time we spend\nmonitoring, we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be\nharmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In\nparticular, our actions to monitor and enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit\nversions of our products or products bearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace,\nwhich could divert sales from us, tarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products. In some\ncircumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property\nposition or for other business reasons.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open-source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open-source software in our proprietary software. From time to time, companies that have\nincorporated open-source software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of\ncertain open-source software or compliance with open-source software license terms. Therefore, we could be subject\nto similar suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or our noncompliance\nwith the open-source software license terms.\nAlthough we have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open-source software, these processes\nand procedures may not be followed appropriately or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of many\nopen-source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products or\ntechnology or impose unanticipated obligations that could require the disclosure of trade secrets. Some open‐source\nsoftware is governed by licenses containing conditions that any person who distributes or uses a modification or\nderivative work of software that was subject to an open‐source license make the modified version subject to the\nsame open‐source license. Distributing or using software that is subject to this kind of open‐source license can\nlead to a requirement that certain aspects of our solutions be distributed or made available in source code form.\nIn such event, we could be required to make portions of our proprietary software generally available under similar\nopen-source software license terms to third parties, including competitors, at low or no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the\nsale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nFurther, use of open‐source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third‐party\ncommercial software, as open‐source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title,\nperformance, non‐infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. Open‐source software typically lacks\nsupport, and authors of such open‐source software may abandon further development and maintenance. Open‐source\nsoftware may contain security vulnerabilities and other liabilities, and we may be subject to additional security\nrisk by using open‐source software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, but there can be\nno assurance that these processes will alleviate all risks with the open‐source software we incorporate.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturers,\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements, we indemnify our content partners, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent or other property infringement based on allegations related to our technology.\nIf a partner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to\nsignificant monetary liabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and licensed Roku\nTV partners often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in\ncircumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the\nclaim does not pertain to our technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually\nlimited.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various lawsuits and other legal proceedings,\ndisputes, claims, and government inquiries and investigations, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to various lawsuits, stockholder derivative actions,\nclass action lawsuits, individual or mass arbitration proceedings, and other types of legal proceedings, as well as\nother disputes, claims, and regulatory or governmental inquiries and investigations, including with regard to\ncontract or commercial disputes, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, intellectual property, tax,\nemployment, and corporate governance, among other matters. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments or\notherwise fail to comply with our contractual obligations, then we could be subject to breach of contract or other\nclaims. Any claims, proceedings, individual or mass arbitration demands, or inquiries or investigations initiated\nby or against us, whether successful or not, may be time-consuming, subject us to damage awards, regulatory orders,\nconsent decrees, injunctive relief, fines, or other penalties or sanctions, require us to change our policies or\npractices, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us\nto incur significant legal fees, other litigation costs and settlement costs, as well as other expenses. In\naddition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future\nclaims. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, child and youth protection, data localization, encryption, telecommunications, social media, payment\nprocessing, subscriptions, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet\naccess, net neutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of minors, and\naccessibility, among others. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims or governmental or\nregulatory inquiries and investigations with regard to our compliance with such regulations and laws.\nSome of our business activities may be within the scope of existing or proposed laws and regulations intended to\nprotect minors online. In this regard, examples of potentially applicable laws and regulations include the UK Age-\nAppropriate Design Code, UK Online Safety Act, the Irish Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data\nProcessing, various minor-specific provisions of the GDPR and EU Digital Services Act, the Children’s Online\nPrivacy Protection Act, age-appropriate design code style laws at the state level, and minor-specific provisions of\nstate consumer privacy laws. Many states have also incorporated children’s privacy requirements into their laws.\nThis is a rapidly evolving area of law and regulation, and the need to comply with this growing body of laws across\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our business and require us to incur additional expenses for\ncompliance. Additionally, there have been a dramatic rise in claims asserted under various unsettled laws in the\nUnited States, including the Video Privacy Protection Act, which provides a private right of action and allows for\nstatutory damages, actual damages, and, in certain cases, attorneys’ fees, and other similar U.S. state video\nprivacy laws.\nAs we develop new products and services and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to new technologies that may require us to make changes to our business practices, and failure\nto adequately address or comply with such laws and regulations may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or\nbrand and reputational harm. For example, to the extent that we incorporate generative AI into our products and\nservices, we will be subject to the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding generative AI technologies.\nVarious national and local governments have proposed or enacted measures that impose new and substantial\nobligations related to the use of generative AI systems, including the EU, California, Colorado, and Utah.\nThe laws and regulations governing our industry are still evolving and, as a result, their application,\ninterpretation and enforcement are uncertain, and they may be interpreted and applied inconsistently with our\ncurrent policies and practices. All litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the\nfederal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing such issues continue to develop. See also “— We and our\nservice providers and partners collect, process, disclose, and store personal information, which creates legal\nobligations and exposes us to potential liability .” Regulatory inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions\ncould also adversely impact our business operations. For example, we and other companies in the media,\nentertainment, and advertising technology industries have been subject to government inquiries and investigations\nby regulatory bodies with regard to our compliance with privacy and data security laws, the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and other applicable laws and regulations. Advocacy organizations have also filed complaints with\ndata protection authorities against businesses with streaming apps and advertising technology, arguing that certain\nof these companies’ practices do not comply with applicable law. The potential effects of such inquiries,\ninvestigations, or enforcement actions are far-reaching, uncertain, and difficult to predict, and may require us,\nour partners, and our advertisers to modify data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial\ncompliance costs and expenses. Furthermore, if we or the third parties that we work with are alleged to violate\napplicable laws, our contractual obligations, or our policies, our users could lose trust in us. Any decrease in\nuser retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, advertisers, or partners,\nand would seriously harm our business.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and\nother countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and\nthe United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions\nshould the conflict further escalate. In addition, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and\ndiplomatic relations continue to be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more.\nContinued uncertainty and friction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international\noperations.\nTrade disputes, geopolitical tensions, or political uncertainty can disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of\nour and our partners’ products, and have a negative impact on consumer confidence, which could impair our future\ngrowth and adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example,\nthe current U.S.\n34\nTable of Contents\nAdministration has imposed or threatened to impose a range of new tariffs and trade restrictions affecting U.S.\nimports from China, Canada, Mexico, and other countries. U.S. policymakers have also discussed possible new tariffs\non components or inputs incorporated into finished products imported into the United States. The threat,\nimplementation, or modification of such new import restrictions, as well as any retaliatory measures adopted by\naffected U.S. trade partners, could increase our costs and otherwise be disruptive to the business environment in\nwhich we operate.\nIn addition, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and other countries imposed economic\nsanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus, and the United States and other\ncountries could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further\nescalate. Similarly, the effects of Brexit on EU-UK political, trade, economic, and diplomatic relations continue\nto be uncertain and such impact may not be fully realized for several years or more. Continued uncertainty and\nfriction may result in regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our international operations.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business.\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and\nsanctions laws, we cannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within\nour complete control, and our products could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries or provided by our\nretailers to third persons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. In addition, there are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any policies, procedures, and internal controls relating to such\ncompliance, and there can be no assurance that such procedures or internal controls will work effectively at all\ntimes or protect us against liability under anti-corruption, sanctions or other laws for actions taken by us, our\nretailers or partners. Any such potential violation by us, our retailers, or our partners could have negative\nconsequences, including government inquiries, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary fines, or civil and/or\ncriminal penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may be harmed.\nThe ability of internet access network operators in some jurisdictions to degrade users’ internet speeds or limit\ninternet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the provision of broadband internet\naccess services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. We believe that the continued\ngrowth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective\nbroadband internet access (including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband\ncontent delivery, and broadband service providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content\ntraveling on their networks. Laws, regulations, or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in\nuse of the internet, including decisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, or that\ndisincentivize internet access network operators’ willingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their\nequipment, could decrease customer demand for our service offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could\ncause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations\ngoverning the provision of internet access service. Substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and\nelsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in the United States, a federal appellate court recently\nprevented new FCC “net neutrality” rules and an associated broadband oversight framework from going into effect,\nfinding that the FCC likely does not have statutory authority to adopt such requirements. As a result, there are no\nFCC rules currently in effect that prohibit internet service providers from unreasonably restricting, blocking,\ndegrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content partners.\nIf network operators were to engage in restricting, blocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede\nour growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise\nimpair our ability to attract and retain users, any of which could harm our business. Several states and foreign\ncountries in which we operate also have adopted or are considering rules governing the provision of internet\naccess. In addition, in some jurisdictions (including the United States), network operators are pursuing proposals\nthat would require or enable them to impose fees on content providers related to delivery of network traffic.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable\n35\nTable of Contents\ndiscrimination are nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we\ncould experience anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or\notherwise harm our business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing\ninterpretations or applications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result\nin additional liabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”), Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) in the United States, and the E-Commerce\nDirective in Europe, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The\nDMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to\nuncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that\nlimit the applicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content\nmoderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit\nour ability to generate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of apps that are distributed on our platform.\nWhile our platform policies prohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the\ncopyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in\ncertain instances our platform has been misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted\ncontent. If content owners or distributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our\nability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated.\nAny failure to maintain internal controls over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately\nreport our financial condition or results of operations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting, are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner,\nare unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports,\nand the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject\nto investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require\nadditional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nThe generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting\nprinciples. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results\nof operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness\nof a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\n36\nTable of Contents\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our founder,\nChairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares\nof our outstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and all\nmatters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions,\nsuch as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s employment with us\nis terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which has the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31, 2024, Mr.\nWood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though he only\nowns 12.0% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a member of our Board of Directors (our\n“Board”), Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably\nbelieves to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr.\nWood is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely\nthis concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not\nsupport. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common\nstock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class\nA common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition, operating results, and key performance metrics;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content partners;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nthe perception that our environmental, social, and corporate governance performance is inadequate compared to\nthat of our competitors;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, geopolitical\ntensions, terrorism, or public health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, tariffs, or\ninternational currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a\nresult of such fluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of\nyour investment. In addition, we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their\nstock have been, and may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation.\nSuch litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business\nconcerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year, at\nthe end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent workers\nmay also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that\n38\nTable of Contents\ncomply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and\nsubsequently sold, it is dilutive to existing stockholders and the market price of our Class A common stock could\ndecline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or\nissues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or\nmore equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory\nand governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, which may\nresult in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from\nrevenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new\nlaws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified directors and officers.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our Credit Agreement contains prohibitions on the\npayment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common\nstock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board so that not all directors are elected at one time;\npermitting our Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business.",

          "content": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nOur enterprise-wide approach to risk management is designed to support the achievement of our organizational and\nstrategic objectives and improve long-term organizational performance. Cybersecurity is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the enterprise risks that are subject to\noversight by our Board and the Audit Committee of our Board (the “Audit Committee”).\nOur cybersecurity program is designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Key\ncomponents of our cybersecurity program include:\nmanaging cybersecurity threats by deploying technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information\nsystems from cybersecurity threats, which we evaluate and seek to improve, including through vulnerability\nassessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence;\nmaintaining cybersecurity incident management procedures to address incident reporting, classification,\nescalation, response, and recovery, and facilitate efficient and consistent management of cybersecurity incidents\ninvolving our information systems;\nassessing and testing our cybersecurity policies and practices via internal efforts (such as assessments,\nvulnerability testing, threat modeling, tabletop exercises, and other exercises focused on evaluating the\neffectiveness of our cybersecurity measures) and by engaging third parties(including cybersecurity consulting\nfirms) to perform assessments of our cybersecurity measures and manage our bug bounty program;\n40\nTable of Contents\na cybersecurity risk management process for third-party vendors,including, among other things, a security\nassessment and contracting process for vendor applications and implementing contractual security measures with\nthird-party vendors; and\ncybersecurity awareness training is available for all employees and enhanced training is provided for certain\nemployees.\nCybersecurity Governance\nAs part of its broader risk oversight activities, the Boardoversees risks from cybersecurity threats, primarily\nthrough delegation to the Audit Committee. As reflected in its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in\nreviewing our significant cybersecurity matters and concerns. The Audit Committee engages on cybersecurity matters\nwith our management team, including our Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security, who regularly provides\npresentations to the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity governance and compliance programs. These presentations\naddress a range of topics including, for example, the threat landscape and cybersecurity events, vulnerability\nassessments, incident preparedness assessments, disaster recovery plans, and cybersecurity awareness training. Two\nadditional members of our Board, who have cybersecurity experience but are not members of the Audit Committee, are\ninvited to attend Audit Committee meetings when review of our cybersecurity program is on the agenda. In addition,\nthe full Board receives regular updates on the activities of the Audit Committee, including with regard to\ncybersecurity oversight.\nOur Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security is principally responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity\nrisk management program, in partnership with other members of management. Our Vice President of Product and\nEnterprise Security has over 30 years of experience in cybersecurity and information technology roles, including\nexecutive leadership positions at public and private companies.\nIn addition, our Executive Incident Management Team (“EIMT”) is a cross-functional management committee dedicated\nto providing executive-level guidance on the cybersecurity incident response process to facilitate an appropriate\nand timely response, make decisions related to cybersecurity incidents, and notify appropriate parties with\nrelevant cross-functional expertise in the event of a cybersecurity incident.\nOur Product and Enterprise Security team is responsible for the day-to-day identification, assessment, and\nmanagement of information security risks and provides regular updates to our Vice President of Product and\nEnterprise Security regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nCybersecurity incidents are escalated to our Vice President of Product and Enterprise Security, the EIMT, and the\nChair of our Audit Committee in accordance with our cybersecurity incident management procedures, so that decisions\ncan be made regarding incident reporting and disclosure in a timely manner.\nNotwithstanding our cybersecurity risk management and governance, we may not be successful in preventing or\nmitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While our business strategy,\nresults of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, we cannot provide assurance that\nthey will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more\ninformation regarding the cybersecurity risks we face, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nunder the caption “Data security incidents, including cybersecurity attacks, or other significant disruptions of\nour information technology systems could harm our reputation, cause us to modify our business practices, and\notherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.”",

          "content": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2023 and\n2022 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\nfiled with the SEC on February 16, 2024.\nOverview\nOur two reportable segments are the platform segment and the devices segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI,\nand related services) and streaming services distribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares,\nthe sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories. We expect to continue to manage the average selling prices of\nRoku streaming devices in an effort to sell more devices, which we believe will increase our Streaming Households.\nWe expect that this trade off from devices gross profit or loss to grow Streaming Households should result in\nincreased platform revenue and platform gross profit over time.\nKey Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Measure\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are Streaming Households, Streaming Hours, ARPU, and Free Cash Flow.\nBeginning with our results for the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer report quarterly updates on Streaming\nHouseholds, and by extension, ARPU. Since we first reported our key performance metrics in connection with our\ninitial public offering in 2017, our business and the streaming industry have evolved significantly. Now, we are\nprimarily focused on the growth of revenue of our platform segment and Adjusted earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA). As a result, effective as of the first quarter of 2025, our key\nperformance metrics will be Streaming Hours, Platform Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.\nStreaming Households\nWe believe that the number of Streaming Households is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We\ndefine Streaming Households as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform\nwithin the last 30 days of the period. We refer to such accounts as “Streaming Households” because a given user\naccount does not necessarily represent a single viewer or a single Roku streaming device. Rather, a single account\nmay be used by multiple viewers and linked to multiple devices. As a result, we may identify more than one\nStreaming Household within a single dwelling, and more than one dwelling may constitute a Streaming Household.\nUsers who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included in this metric.\nAdditionally, users who only register an account for use of one of our smart home products are not included in our\nreported number of Streaming Households.\nWe had 89.8 million and 80.0 million Streaming Households as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 12%.\nStreaming Hours\nWe believe the number of Streaming Hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define Streaming Hours as the aggregate amount of time Roku streaming\ndevices stream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku\nplatforms are not included in this metric. Additionally, smart home products do not contribute to our Streaming\nHours.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content partners is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming apps, and the number of Streaming Hours\ndoes not correlate to revenue earned from such content partners or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nStreaming Hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku streaming device is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming app may\ncontinue to play content for\n44\nTable of Contents\na period of time determined by the streaming app. We believe that this also occurs across a wide variety of non-\nRoku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince 2020, all of our Roku streaming devices include a Roku TV OS feature that is designed to identify when\ncontent has been continuously streaming on an app for an extended period of time without user interaction. This\nfeature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are\nstill watching the selected app and closes the app if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the\nimplementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, content partners, and\nadvertisers. Some of our leading content partners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar features within\ntheir apps. This Roku TV OS feature supplements these app features. This feature has not had and is not expected to\nhave a material impact on our financial performance.\nWe streamed 127.1 billion and 106.0 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nreflecting an increase of 20%.\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing\nfour quarters divided by the average of the number of Streaming Households at the end of the current period and the\nend of the corresponding period in the prior year. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our Streaming\nHouseholds base and the progress of our platform business.\nARPU was $41.49 as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $39.92 as of December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase of 4%\n. The increase in ARPU was driven by platform revenue growth in the United States, partially offset by an\nincreasing share of Streaming Households in international markets where we are currently focused more on scale and\nengagement than monetization.\nFree Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)\nWe use Free Cash Flow as a primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we believe maximizing\nFree Cash Flow helps indicate the financial strength of our business, as well as provide an indication of cash\ngenerated or (used) by the business. Our goal is to continuously increase Free Cash Flow over time. We define Free\nCash Flow as our trailing 12-month (“TTM”) cash flows from operating activities excluding purchases of property and\nequipment and the effects of exchange rates on cash.\nOur Free Cash Flow was $203.2 million and $175.9 million for the TTM periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Free Cash Flow reconciliation excludes purchases of property\nand equipment and effects of exchange rates on cash from the cash flows from operating activities, in each case\nwhere applicable. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful as a supplement in evaluating our ongoing operational\nperformance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. However, this non-GAAP\nfinancial measure has limitations, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP\nfinancial information, such as GAAP cash flows from operating activities. For additional information about cash\nflows from operating activities, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. In addition, Free Cash Flow may not\nbe comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTrailing Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2024       December 31, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating              $                       218,045    $            255,856\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property and                                      -5,061                 -82,619\nequipment\nAdd/(Less):\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash,                             -9,746                   2,654\ncash equivalents and restricted cash\nFree cash flow (TTM)                        $                       203,238    $            175,891\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls). Our ad inventory includes video ad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku\nChannel, native display ads throughout the Roku Experience, as well as ad inventory we obtain through our streaming\nservices distribution\n45\nTable of Contents\nagreements with our content partners. To supplement supply, we purchase advertising inventory from our content\npartners, on an as needed basis. To date, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nDevices Revenue\nWe generate devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services,\naudio products, and related accessories. We generate most of our devices revenue in the United States. In our\ninternational markets, we primarily sell our devices through wholesale distributors which, in turn, sell to\nretailers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Revenue, Platform\nCost of revenue, platform primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory, content\namortization costs for both licensed and produced content, costs for licensed premium subscriptions, and revenue\nshare payments on licensed content.

The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $11.9\nmillion from higher cash balances, partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses of $5.0 million due to\nexchange rate fluctuations and a decrease in other income of $1.9 million mainly from lower unrealized gains\nrelated to the change in the fair value of strategic investments .\nIncome Tax Expense\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2024         2023       Change $    Change %\nIncome tax expense                    $                     9,428    $  10,131    $      -703          -7  %\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense decreased by $0.7 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance\non certain foreign deferred tax assets, partially offset by increases in U.S. and foreign current taxes due to the\nincrease of taxable earnings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,160.2 million. Approximately 5% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and devices revenue. The primary uses of cash are costs of\nrevenue including costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party\nmanufacturing costs for our products, as well as operating expenses such as personnel-related expenses, consulting\nand professional service expenses, facility expenses, and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases\nof property and equipment and mergers and acquisitions.\nWe have pursued merger and acquisition activities in the past, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition\nactivities in the future, including the acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. Though we do not\nexpect to incur expenses for facilities and building related costs at the same level as the last few fiscal years,\nwe will continue to incur expenses on the maintenance of our facilities and purchases of computer systems, and\nother property and equipment, in order to support future growth in our business. These activities may materially\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance, and our undrawn available balance under our Credit\nAgreement (as discussed below), will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and material\ncash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital\nrequirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be affected by various risks,\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the\neffects of the current macroeconomic environment. While the current macroeconomic environment has not severely\nimpacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local\neconomies and in capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in\nthe future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we\nraise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and\nalso to restrictive covenants. Additionally, we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are\nacceptable to us.\nCredit Agreement\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of our\nsubsidiaries, as guarantors, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and with Citibank N.A., as administrative\nagent (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $300.0 million, and (ii) an uncommitted increase option of up to an additional $300.0\nmillion exercisable upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The Credit Agreement provides for a\n$100.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit, and certain existing letters of credit were\ndeemed outstanding under this facility. The Credit Agreement will mature on September 16, 2029. Proceeds from the\nCredit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance working capital requirements.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and our\nsubsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. We may prepay, and in certain circumstances, would be\nrequired to prepay, loans under the Credit Agreement without payment of a premium. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains customary representations and warranties, customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial\ncovenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total net leverage ratio, as\nwell as customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in amounts borrowed under the Credit\nAgreement becoming due and payable and remaining commitments terminated prior to its scheduled September 16, 2029\ntermination date.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit secured by the Credit Agreement of $36.4 million as of December 31, 2024. As\nof December 31, 2024, we had not borrowed against the Credit Agreement, and we were in compliance with all of the\ncovenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional details.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2024          2023\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   218,045    $  255,856\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                   -25,061    $  -92,619\nCash flows used in financing activities    $                   -89,203    $  -61,243\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $218.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our net loss of\n$129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $756.2 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization and write-off of content assets, depreciation and amortization of\nproperty and equipment and intangible assets, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, impairment of assets\nas part of restructuring charges, foreign currency remeasurement losses, and fair value changes of strategic\ninvestments. The negative impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $408.8 million was primarily\ndue to payments made to acquire content, a decrease in accounts payable, payments made for operating leases\nliabilities, an increase in inventory, an increase in other long-term assets, and an increase in prepaid expenses\nand other current assets, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities due to timing of payments and an\nincrease in deferred revenue.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 included purchases of\nproperty and equipment and expenditures related to the expansion of our office facilities of $5.1 million and an\nadditional strategic investment of $20.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to\ntax payments of $96.4 million to net settle equity awards vested during the period and the payment of $2.2 million\nin issuance costs related to our Credit Agreement, offset by $9.4 million received from proceeds from the exercise\nof employee stock options.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nFor a description of our purchase obligations and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12 and Note 9 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, respectively.\nIn addition, we have $4.8 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. We adjust these positions\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. We are\nunable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. Although we believe we have\nadequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these\nmatters will not be materially different.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be reasonable\nat the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nJudgment may be required in determining whether products contain multiple distinct performance obligations and\nwhether each should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation\nbased on its relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Our process for determining SSP requires judgment. For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, we consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on prices\ncharged to customers for individual products, taking into consideration other factors, which may include (i)\nhistorical and expected discounting practices, (ii) the size, and volume of transactions, (iii) the geographic\nareas in which our products are sold, and (iv) our overall go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations\nthat are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen arrangements have variable consideration, we utilize the expected value method to estimate the amount expected\nto be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained to\nthe extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment of historical,\ncurrent, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nThe transaction price in some of our arrangements include non-cash consideration. We determine the fair value of\nnon-cash consideration at contract inception by using historical internal and current observable third-party data.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur devices revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price.\nAmortization of Content Assets\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage of such content\nwhich results in accelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Judgment is\nrequired to determine the amortization patterns of our content assets which are monetized as a group. Critical\njudgments include: (i)\n51\nTable of Contents\nthe predominant monetization strategy of content, (ii) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, and\n(iii) the application of historical viewership model and projected decay. These judgments and underlying analysis\nare reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed on a prospective basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets with\nfinite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group\nto which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances indicate an asset or asset group’s\ncarrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net\ncash flows directly associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group against their\nrespective carrying amounts. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.6 million for operating lease\nright-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $7.0 million for property and equipment related to a decision to\ncease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $131.6 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and an\nimpairment charge of $72.3 million for property and equipment related to a decision to sub-lease and cease the use\nof certain office facilities and related property and equipment. There were no impairments of property and\nequipment or operating lease right-of-use assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 17 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nSignificant judgments and estimates included in the determination of the fair value of the assets were\nidentification of events or changes in circumstances necessitating an impairment assessment, the expected downtime\nprior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and\ndiscount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nOur accounts receivable is stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical\nexperience, promotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales\nreturns and sales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual\nresults, the losses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset\nand liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or\nrefundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifferences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates. The\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than\nnot they will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess all available positive\nand negative evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be\nchallenged by tax authorities. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions,\nincluding interest and penalties, we provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be\nmaterially different.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates while taking into account current tax laws to determine the current\nincome tax provision (benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities, and valuation allowance recorded against a\ndeferred tax asset. Changes in tax law, their interpretation, and resolution of tax audits could significantly\nimpact the income taxes provided in our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates\nrelative to the amount of deferred income taxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions,\njudgments and estimates mentioned above could cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements are discussed and included in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents. The\nprimary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly\n52\nTable of Contents\nincreasing risk. We believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points on our cash and cash\nequivalents balance would increase or decrease our interest income by approximately $21.6 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and as such we have minimal foreign currency risk related\nto our revenue. Our foreign currency risk primarily relates to operating expenses, cash balances and lease\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, primarily British pounds and Euros. Our results of\ncurrent and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Streaming Services Distribution – Refer to Note 2 to\nthe financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content partners, management is required to\nestimate variable consideration from revenue sharing related to streaming services distribution.\nVariable consideration related to streaming services distribution (“content partner arrangements”) is included in\nthe estimated transaction price based on the expected value for which a significant reversal of revenue is not\nexpected to occur. For streaming services distribution, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the partner’s applications.\nWe identified the forecasts of variable consideration relating to streaming services distribution as a critical\naudit matter due to the significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration. Such estimates required\na high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to\nstreaming services distribution.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\n◦ Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\n◦ Analyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for revenue sharing.\n◦ Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance,

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and\nprogrammatic video advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services) and streaming services\ndistribution (including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls). The Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming\nplayers, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products, and related accessories.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Certain prior period amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\namortization and impairment of content assets;\nthe impairment of long-lived assets;\ninventory reserves;\nvaluation of strategic investments (see Note 7);\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 includes foreign currency translation\nadjustments.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and\nliabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at exchange rates in\neffect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue\nand expenses are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Foreign currency gains\nor losses from remeasurement are recorded as Other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The\nCompany recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 6.4million, a loss of $ 1.5million, and a gain of $ 8.2million during\nthe years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also has some foreign subsidiaries which use local currency as their functional currency. The financial\nstatements of these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and\nliabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity.\n63\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposit accounts\nand investments in money market funds.\nThe Company’s restricted cash balance is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and is used to secure outstanding letters of credit related to operating leases for office\nfacilities.\nThe Company maintains its cash, cash equivalent, and restricted cash balances with financial institutions of high\ncredit quality and continuously monitors the amount of exposure to any one institution and diversifies as necessary\nin order to minimize its concentration risk. Such balances often exceed regulated insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consisted of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024          2023          2022\nBeginning balance                    $                     7,808    $    7,417    $    6,015\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,502        16,560        19,068\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -17,883       -16,169       -17,666\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     6,427    $    7,808    $    7,417\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024          2023           2022\nBeginning balance                       $                    23,024    $   28,903    $    48,411\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                     179,100        85,178         94,731\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                       -138,757       -91,057       -114,239\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    63,367    $   23,024    $    28,903\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024         2023        2022\nBeginning balance                  $                     2,213    $   3,498    $  2,158\nProvision for doubtful accounts                            790        1,674       2,081\nAdjustments for write-off                               -1,108       -2,959        -741\nEnding balance                     $                     1,895    $   2,213    $  3,498\nCustomers J and B accounted for 12% and 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31,\n2024 . The Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of its accounts\nreceivable, net balance as of December 31, 2023.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment at least annually\nduring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill or\n64\nTable of Contents\nindefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes\nin the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived-intangible asset is less than its carrying value. In performing\nits annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test for impairment or it can\ndirectly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s qualitative assessment, if it is determined that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets is, more likely than not, less than its\ncarrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount\nover its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. Any excess of an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying amount over its fair value is\nrecorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets\nwith finite lives for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of an asset or asset\ngroup based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with their use and eventual\ndisposition. If the asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess\nof the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill in any of the periods reported.\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge related to abandoned technology assets of $ 7.5million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. There were no impairments of intangible assetsduring the years ended December 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. See Note 17 for additional details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 22.6million for operating\nlease right-of-use assets and an impairment charge of $ 7.0million for property and equipment related to a decision\nto cease the use of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. During the year ended December\n31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 131.6million for operating lease right-of-use assets and\nan impairment charge of $ 72.3million for property and equipment related to a decision to sub-lease and cease the\nuse of certain office facilities and related property and equipment. There were noimpairments of property and\nequipment or operating lease right-of-use assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 17 for\nadditional details.\nContent Assets\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as Content assets, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. For licensed content, the cost per title is capitalized along with a corresponding liability when the\nlicense period begins, the content is available for streaming and when the fee is determinable. For produced\ncontent, all direct production costs are capitalized. Payment terms for certain licensed content require advanced\npayments which are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe amortization expense for content assets (licensed and produced) is based on projected usage which results in\naccelerated or straight-lined patterns depending on the nature of the content. Projected usage is mainly based on\nhistorical and projected viewing patterns. Amortization of content assets is included in Cost of revenue, platform\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nContent assets (licensed and produced) are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less than the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether\nthe film group is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment\ncharges of $ 65.5million related to restructuring. See Note 17 for additional details.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the\npromised goods or services in the contract which may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the\ninception of each arrangement, the Company evaluates the likelihood that the payments will be collected. When\narrangements have variable consideration, the Company utilizes the expected value method to estimate the amount\nexpected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is\nconstrained to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur in a future period. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on prices charged to customers\nfor individual products in consideration with historical and expected discounting practices, the size, and volume\nof transactions, geographic location, and go-to-market strategy. For those performance obligations that are not\nroutinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and\nother observable inputs.\nWhen the Company’s arrangements involve third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the\nprincipal, and reports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this\nassessment, the Company considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic\nvideo advertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies or third-party demand\nand supply-side platforms and to content partners for their media and entertainment promotions. Advertising\narrangements include video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions which include multiple\nperformance obligations that are distinct advertising products. For such arrangements, the Company allocates\nrevenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company recognizes revenue either\non a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the\nprincipal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being\nprimarily responsible to its customers for the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing\npricing. The Company recognizes video and display advertising revenues primarily when the ad is delivered.\nThe Company’s content distribution arrangements within its streaming services distribution activities include cash\nor non-cash consideration. The content distribution arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts\nthat sign up for new services and at the time of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis\nas the Company is deemed to be the agent between content partners and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time\nelapsed basis, by day, as the services are delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration\nis usually in the form of advertising inventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal\nand third-party data.\nThe Company sells Premium Subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded app buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to a\ncontent partner’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nDevices segment:\nThe Company generates devices revenue from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories.\nThe Company sells the majority of its devices in the U.S. through retailers and distributors as well as through the\nCompany’s website. Devices revenue primarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and\nupdates on a when-and-if available basis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified\nupgrades and updates are available to customers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated\nvalue of the\n66\nTable of Contents\nunspecified upgrades and updates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as devices revenue ratably on a time elapsed\nbasis over the estimated economic life of the associated products.\nThe Company’s devices revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in devices revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\ndevices.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term\nand lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nAs the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease\npayments. The Company takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the\nincremental borrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the\nlease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For its office building leases, the Company\nhas elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent for all leases, where applicable. Non-lease components included within the combined component typically\nrepresent common area maintenance and utilities, and are variable payments based on actual costs.\nThe Company also subleases a portion of its available office space in connection with its restructuring efforts.\nThe subleases are each classified as operating, consistent with their head lease classification. The combined lease\nand non-lease components are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases . Lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line basis beginning after the commencement date of the sublease, and offset\nagainst the related head lease expense within operating expenses.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The Company elected to apply the fair value option on its investment in convertible\npromissory notes and it is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels for excess and obsolete products, based\non its assessment of future demand and market conditions. The Company recognized inventory provisions charged to\nthe Cost of revenue, Devices, of $ 9.5million and $ 1.7million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ending inventory reserve was $ 28.7million and $ 17.7million,\nrespectively.\nIn addition, the Company records a liability for expected losses on firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase\ncommitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers. The Company recorded losses on purchase commitments,\nrecorded in Cost of revenue, Devices, of $ 34.3million and $ 19.7million during the years ended December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The associated liabilities related to the anticipated losses on firm purchase commitments\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between 18months and five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized\nover the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from oneto 11years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. Software development costs and the related amortization\nexpenses are not material for any of the periods presented.\n67\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of devices revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, and advance payments from advertisers and content partners,\nwhere performance obligations are not yet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is\nclassified as a current liability and the remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses are recognized when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $ 9.7million, $ 3.7million, and\n$ 10.0million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from a weighted average of the historical volatility of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock price and the stock price volatilities of several peer companies which are similar\nin size and/or operational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of the Company’s stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using\nthe enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets on a more\nlikely than not basis, to the amount that is expected to be realized in the future. The Company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position\nwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for\nincome taxes.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 1, 2024, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 requires companies to provide\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses within its reportable segment disclosures on an annual and\ninterim basis.

Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets decreased by $ 16.3million and $ 24.7million\nduring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the timing of billing to customers.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ 4.0million and $ 10.8million during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, due to an increase in subscription revenue related to Premium\nSubscriptions and smart home products, higher devices revenue, and due to the billings in excess of revenue\nrecognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to platform revenue arrangements. Deferred\nrevenue increased by approximately $ 41.4million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to billings\nin excess of revenue recognized and timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to revenue\narrangements.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2023 was $ 102.2million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $ 88.4million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Remaining performance obligations exclude contracts with original expected terms of one year or\nless. Estimated contracted revenue for these remaining performance obligations was $ 923.3million as of December\n31, 2024, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 64% over the next 12months and the remainder\nthereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 18.2million and $ 45.5million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nCustomer J and Customer I accounted for 10% and 11% of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively . The Company did not have any customer that individually accounted for 10% or more of its total\nnet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n4.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS\nInvestment in Convertible Promissory Notes\nIn June 2022, the Company agreed to provide financing of up to $ 60.0million in the aggregate to a counterparty\nwith whom the Company has a commercial relationship. The advances are in the form of convertible promissory notes\nand are included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The convertible promissory notes\naccrue interest at 5% per annum, and have maturity dates as reflected in the table below or are due upon a\nredemption event or in the event of a default.\nThe convertible promissory notes and their date of investment and maturity are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2024\nDate of Investment         Amount of Investment    Date of Maturity\nJune 15, 2022                           $40,000    June 15, 2025\nMarch 23, 2023                           $5,000    March 23, 2026\nMay 23, 2023                             $5,000    May 23, 2026\nThe convertible promissory notes contain certain redemption features that meet the definition of embedded\nderivatives and require bifurcation. The Company elected to apply the fair value option and account for the hybrid\ninstrument containing the host contract and the embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument, with any\nsubsequent changes in fair value included in Other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. See\nNote 8 for additional details on the fair value of the convertible promissory notes.\nInvestment in Preferred Stock\nIn September 2024, the Company invested $ 20.0million in cash in exchange for preferred stock in a privately-held\ncompany. The Company elected to apply the measurement alternative for equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values as there are no quoted market prices for the preferred stock. This investment is measured\nat cost and adjusted to fair value when there is an observable price change from orderly transactions of identical\nor similar investments, and assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. There were no adjustments recognized in the year ended December 31, 2024. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the carrying value of the investment was $ 20.0million, and is included within Other non-current\nassets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n8.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured using Level 1 inputs include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid\nexpenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. The Company did not have any Level 2\ninstruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company measured its strategic investment in convertible promissory notes using Level\n3 inputs. The fair value of the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes on the date of purchase was\ndetermined to be equal to its principal amount. The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $ 1.4million and $\n4.3million, and an unrealized loss of $ 0.5million in Other income, net related to the change in the fair value of\nthe strategic investment in convertible promissory notes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe Company classified the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes as Level 3 due to the lack of\nrelevant observable market data over fair value inputs. The fair value of the strategic investment in convertible\npromissory notes was estimated using a scenario-based probability weighted discounted cash flow model. Significant\nassumptions include the discount rate, and the timing and probability weighting of the various redemption scenarios\nthat impact the settlement of the strategic investment in convertible promissory notes.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $ 22.6million related to\noperating lease right-of-use assets, and $ 7.0million related to property and equipment related to the associated\nleases.\n74\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $ 269.4million that\nincluded $ 131.6million of operating lease right-of-use assets impairment, $ 72.3million of property and equipment\nimpairment, and $ 65.5million of content assets impairment related to the Company’s restructuring efforts. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 7.5million related to the\nabandonment of future development of certain technology assets.\nThe fair value of the impaired operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models, or the income approach, based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs.\nThe significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement\nof future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect\nthe level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows. For the licensed and produced content that was\nremoved from The Roku Channel, the net carrying amount of the content assets was written off. For the abandoned\ntechnology assets, the net carrying amount of the technology assets was written off.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate. The leases have remaining terms\nranging from less than 1year to 9years and may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The depreciable\nlife of ROU assets is limited by the expected lease term.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024          2023         2022\nOperating lease expense          $                    70,527    $   83,060    $  76,359\nVariable lease expense                                22,562        23,331       18,991\nSublease income                                      -12,578          -139            —\nTotal operating lease expense    $                    80,511    $  106,252    $  95,350\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in thousands):\nCash paid for amounts included in the          Years Ended December 31,\nmeasurement of lease liabilities:                                  2024          2023          2022\nOperating cash outflows from operating      $                    92,076    $   74,278    $   56,370\nleases\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange\nfor lease obligations:\nOperating leases                            $                    10,462    $   40,866    $  231,728\nDecrease in operating lease right-of-use    $                    22,618    $  131,646    $        —\nassets due to impairment (See Note 17)\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease term and\ndiscount rate):\nAs of December 31,\n2024                2023\nOperating lease right-of-use assets       $             304,505          $  371,444\nOperating lease liability, current                       79,221              68,099\n(included in Accrued liabilities)\nOperating lease liability, non-current                  512,706             586,174\nTotal operating lease liability           $             591,927          $  654,273\nWeighted-average remaining term for                              7.02                7.94\noperating leases (in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate for                         3.98     %          3.94     %\noperating leases\n75\nTable of Contents\nFuture lease payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,                          Operating Leases(2)\n2025                                           $              101,265\n2026                                                          102,037\n2027                                                          100,002\n2028                                                           99,653\n2029                                                           96,037\nThereafter                                                    185,173\nTotal future lease payments                                   684,167\nLess: imputed interest                                        -88,981\nLess: expected tenant improvement allowance                    -3,259\nTotal(1)                                       $              591,927\n(1) Total lease liabilities include liabilities related to operating lease right-of-use assets which were included\nin the impairment charges as part of the Company’s restructuring efforts.

These contingencies are reviewed at\nleast quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal\nproceedings can be, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nThe Company is, and may become, subject to various lawsuits, stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits,\nindividual or mass arbitration proceedings, and other types of legal proceedings, as well as other disputes,\nclaims, and regulatory or governmental inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business, relating to\ncommercial, contract, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, intellectual property, tax, employment,\ncorporate governance, and other matters. Although the results of these legal proceedings, disputes, claims, and\ninquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final\noutcome of any matters that it is currently involved in is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on\nits business, financial condition, or results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings,\ndisputes, claims, and inquiries and investigations can have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal fees,\nother litigation costs, and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, reputational harm, and other\nfactors. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not have any loss contingencies\nthat were material.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n13.

Due to\nthis required capitalization of research and development expenses, the Company has recorded U.S. current income tax\nexpense of $ 13.2million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. As of December 31, 2024, the Company analyzed all available objective evidence, both positive and\nnegative, and believes it is more-likely-than-not that some deferred tax assets will not be realizable.\nAccordingly, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.\nAs of each reporting date, the Company considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its\nview of the future realization of deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company\nrecognized a tax benefit of $ 11.1million related to the release of its valuation allowance against certain foreign\ndeferred tax assets, which are expected to be utilized based on future forecasted income.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 61.3million, $ 166.0million, and $\n199.2million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The change in the valuation\nallowance during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is primarily attributable to an increase in\ndeferred tax assets generated through capitalization of section 174 research and development expenses for U.S.\nfederal and conforming state purposes. The Company’s foreign valuation allowance decreased by $ 51.9million and\nincreased by $ 3.5million and $ 2.2million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe change in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in deferred tax assets as a result of the valuation allowance release in the Netherlands. The change in\nthe valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is primarily attributable to an increase\nin net operating losses. The change in valuation allowance for all years is a charge or benefit to income tax\nexpense.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,283.4million and $ 1,380.4million are available to reduce future taxable income.

The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change\nsignificantly within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. The Company recorded $ 0.9million and $ 1.0million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and certain\nforeign jurisdictions. All tax years remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits\ninclude questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and\ncompliance with federal, state, and local tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized and distributions are generally exempt as a\nresult of the Tax Act, the Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as\nforeign withholding taxes and state income tax.\n14. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. NoCompany contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nThe Company has defined contribution plans for employees in certain of its international locations. The Company\ncontributed $ 4.1million, $ 3.2million, and $ 2.3million to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively.\n15. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to calculate net loss per\nshare. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and as otherwise expressly provided\nin the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by applicable law, shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share\nratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are\nthe same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net loss per share, options to purchase common stock and restricted\nstock units are considered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the\ntreasury stock method. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in the\nperiod of net loss, as their effect is antidilutive.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share as follows (in thousands,\nexcept per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                        2024                    2023                    2022\nNet loss                   $                  -129,386             $  -709,561             $  -498,005\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                  144,630                 141,572                 137,668\noutstanding — basic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per share —       $                     -0.89             $     -5.01             $     -3.62\nbasic and diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because of their anti-dilutive\neffect were 14.4million, 14.0million and 14.4million units of equity awards to purchase common stock granted under\nthe Company’s equity plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n16. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on gross profit for each operating segment. The CODM uses segment gross\nprofit to allocate resources to each segment predominantly in the annual budgeting process. On a quarterly basis,\nthe CODM uses gross profit budget-to-actual variances to evaluate segment performance. For both the Platform and\nDevices reportable segments, Cost of revenue is the significant segment expense that is regularly provided to the\nCODM. The Company uses the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be\ndisaggregated and presented separately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The\nmanagement approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for\nmaking operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance.\nWhile not considered significant segment expenses, the Company has separately disclosed content amortization (refer\nto Note 6) and stock-based compensation expense (refer to Note 11) charged to Cost of revenue, Platform. The\nCompany disclosed charges related to the inventory provision and inventory losses on purchase commitments (refer to\nNote 2) and stock-based compensation expense (refer to Note 11) included within Cost of revenue, Devices.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does\nnot allocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nDescriptions of the Company’s tworeportable segments are as follows:\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue is generated from the sale of digital advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, ads integrated into our UI, and related services), as well as streaming services distribution\n(including subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\napp buttons on remote controls).\nDevices\nDevices revenue is generated from the sale of streaming players, Roku-branded TVs, smart home products and\nservices, audio products, and related accessories.\n83\nTable of Contents\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024       2023       2022\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer I                                            *      13  %          *\nCustomer J                                        12  %          *          *\nDevices segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        22  %      15  %          *\nCustomer B                                        21  %      15  %      21  %\nCustomer C                                        28  %      41  %      38  %\nCustomer K                                        10  %          *          *\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.\nLong-lived assets, net\nThe following table presents long-lived assets, net, which consist primarily of property and equipment and\noperating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2024          2023\nUnited States      $             401,464    $  497,024\nUnited Kingdom                    92,110       109,315\nOther countries                   24,621        29,661\nTotal              $             518,195    $  636,000\n17. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nThe Company began efforts to reduce its operating expense growth rate due to economic conditions in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2022. The Company recorded employee termination expenses, and an impairment charge related to\nabandoned technology assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company implemented additional measures including consolidating its\noffice space utilization, performing a strategic review of its content portfolio, reducing outside services\nexpenses, and slowing its year-over-year headcount expense growth rate through a workforce reduction and limiting\nnew hires, among other measures. As a result of these measures, the Company recorded restructuring charges\nassociated with employee termination expenses consisting primarily of severance payments, employee benefits\ncontributions, payroll taxes and related costs, impairment charges related to decisions to sub-lease and cease the\nuse of certain office facilities and related property and equipment, and impairment charges related to removing\nselect licensed and produced content from The Roku Channel during that period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded restructuring charges associated with employee\ntermination expenses consisting primarily of severance payments, employee benefits contributions, payroll taxes and\nrelated costs, and impairment charges related to decisions to sub-lease and cease the use of certain office\nfacilities and related property and equipment.\n84\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring charges are recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nEmployee           Facilities Exit           Asset Impairment        Total\nTerminations                     Costs                    Charges\nCost of revenue,      $                    -3    $                    —    $                     —    $      -3\nplatform\nCost of revenue,                            1                         —                          5            6\ndevices\nResearch and                              368                        98                       -603         -137\ndevelopment\nSales and                                 697                       719                     24,641       26,057\nmarketing\nGeneral and                              -116                       117                      5,075        5,076\nadministrative\nTotal\nrestructuring         $                   947    $                  934    $                29,118    $  30,999\ncharges\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nEmployee           Facilities Exit           Asset Impairment         Total\nTerminations                     Costs                    Charges\nCost of revenue,      $                1,164    $                    1    $                65,867    $   67,032\nplatform\nCost of revenue,                         524                         6                      2,793         3,323\ndevices\nResearch and                          31,160                     1,320                     78,011       110,491\ndevelopment\nSales and                             29,786                       517                     83,411       113,714\nmarketing\nGeneral and                           20,531                     1,683                     39,320        61,534\nadministrative\nTotal\nrestructuring         $               83,165    $                3,527    $               269,402    $  356,094\ncharges\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nEmployee       Facilities Exit              Assets Impairment        Total\nTerminations       Costs                                  Charges\nCost of revenue,      $                     —    $  —                      $                     —    $       —\nplatform\nCost of revenue,                            —       —                                            —            —\ndevices\nResearch and                           12,092       —                                        7,500       19,592\ndevelopment\nSales and                              10,904       —                                            —       10,904\nmarketing\nGeneral and                             7,644       —                                            —        7,644\nadministrative\nTotal\nrestructuring         $                30,640    $  —                      $                 7,500    $  38,140\ncharges\nThe asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 include $ 22.6million of operating lease right-\nof-use assets impairment and $ 7.0million of property and equipment impairment, offset by $ 0.5million of\nadjustments to other long-term liabilities and assets.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nherein.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n86\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 14, 2025\n87\nTable of Contents",
