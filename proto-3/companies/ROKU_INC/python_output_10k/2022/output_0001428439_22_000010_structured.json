          "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku,” “the Company,” “we,” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States,\nMexico, and Canada by hours streamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV. We believe that someday, all TV content and all TV advertising will be streamed.\nThe shift of the TV ecosystem to streaming is continuing and is creating more options for consumers, content\npublishers, advertisers, and other industry participants. TV streaming is now mainstream and consumers are spending\nmore time watching TV streaming services, with many ‘cutting the cord’ from legacy TV services entirely. Over the\npast several years, nearly every major media company has entered TV streaming and launched a streaming service.\nSimilarly, advertisers looking to reach and engage with streaming audiences are increasingly taking advantage of\nthe benefits inherent to the digital advertising capabilities of TV streaming platforms and are re-allocating their\nbudgets accordingly.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the global TV streaming platform that connects and benefits the entire TV ecosystem of\nconsumers, content publishers, and advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we are focused on connecting\nconsumers to the entertainment they love, enabling content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and\nproviding advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers. Central to our platform is the Roku operating\nsystem (the “Roku OS”). The Roku OS is purpose built for TV and designed to run on low-cost hardware which allows\nus to manufacture and sell streaming players that are affordable. The Roku OS also powers Roku TV models that are\nmanufactured and sold by our TV brand partners who license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV hardware reference\ndesigns. Roku TV models and Roku streaming players enable consumers to access a wide selection of content by\nconnecting their Roku device to our streaming platform via a home broadband network.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to address the needs of our\nconsumers, content publishers, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and other partners. Consumers can discover and\naccess a wide variety of streaming content, content publishers can reach our highly-engaged user base of over 60\nmillion active accounts and utilize our billing services and data insight tools, advertisers can serve targeted and\nmeasurable ads to the TV viewers that they want to reach, Roku TV brand partners can build market share by offering\nhigh performance smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-\nrated streaming devices online and in stores. We continue to invest significant resources to advance the Roku OS;\nto provide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; to obtain content\nfor our platform that attracts users, including our own original content; and to extend Roku’s advantage as the\nstreaming decade continues.\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we build scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we increase engagement by growing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we\nmonetize the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is designed\nto fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers, advertisers,\nTV brand partners, other device licensees, and retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make access to TV streaming affordable in part by offering a lineup of stand-alone streaming players that\nconnect to a user’s TV. To enhance our users’ experience and to provide a better audio experience, we also offer\nour Roku Streambars with a streaming player built in that enables the soundbar to connect to our streaming\nplatform, Roku wireless speakers that connect to Roku TV models and Roku Streambars, and our Roku Wireless\nSubwoofers. Furthermore, we offer customer choice with The Roku TV Ready program, which in partnership with audio\ncompanies, we enable their audio products to work seamlessly with Roku TV models. We launch new devices and provide\nupdates via the Roku OS periodically to ensure they offer the highest performance at an affordable price.\nWe also license the Roku OS to TV brand partners that manufacture and sell co-branded Roku TV models that integrate\nthe Roku OS to enable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong active\naccount growth through our Roku TV licensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low\nhardware costs, enabling these TV brand licensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced\nfor consumers and that are automatically updated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\n5\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telecommunications service operators that distribute co-branded\nplayers to their subscribers in their markets.\nWe offer consumers tremendous optionality and value with respect to gaining access to the Roku platform that is\ncombined with an exceptional user experience on the platform. We have been able to significantly scale our active\naccount base over a multi-year period. In 2021, we added over 8.9 million active accounts, ending the year with\n60.1 million active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content and easy-to-use user interface drives increased user\nengagement by delivering a better overall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform have grown from\n58.7 billion hours in 2020 to 73.2 billion hours in 2021, as our active accounts have grown through the\ndistribution of Roku streaming players and our partners’ Roku TV models.\nThrough our streaming platform and our streaming devices, we make it easy and affordable for our users to watch\ntheir favorite TV shows and movies, as well as listen to streaming audio. Furthermore, we believe our platform\noffers users an incredible streaming experience through a user interface that is easy to use and navigate. From the\nRoku home screen, our users can easily find and access the 500,000+ free and paid movies and TV episodes, as well\nas live TV, news, sports, hit movies, popular shows, and more, that are available from the thousands of channels on\nour streaming platform. And Roku’s powerful cross-channel search capabilities make it simple for our users to find\nthe entertainment they are looking for. Users have the optionality to align their spend to their budget by choosing\ncontent that is available on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct relationship with\nour users provides us with detailed insights about our users and their behavior on our platform, including certain\ncontent they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they purchase\nor subscribe to on our platform. Our first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content\nrecommendations to improve our users’ experience.\nWe enable our content partners to publish streaming channels, quickly and easily, which makes us an attractive\nplatform for content publishers to partner with as they seek to reach TV streaming, or over-the-top (“OTT”), users.\nContent publishers can deliver content directly to our large and relevant audiences and reach those users who no\nlonger use or those who never used legacy TV or paid TV subscriptions. As consumers shift to TV streaming, content\npublishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users directly.\nThe Roku Channel is our own streaming channel that drives user engagement on our platform by providing our users\nfree, ad-supported access to a large library of third-party movies and shows on-demand that we directly license,\nlive streaming linear channels, original content, and subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) content made available\nthrough Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel. The Roku Channel offers Premium Subscriptions from dozens of\ncontent partners, giving users the ability to browse all available content before signing up, obtain free trials\nfor subscriptions, sign up in one-click, and enjoy simple subscription management with a single monthly bill. The\nRoku Channel also is intended to help content publishers drive additional viewership and maximize the value of\ntheir content on our platform. For example, we provide personalized content selection for users and integrated Roku\nPay billing services into The Roku Channel to enable one-click subscriptions. The Roku Channel is available in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In the United States, The Roku Channel features a diverse lineup of\nmore than 80,000 free movies and TV shows, including original and exclusive content, 200+ free live linear\ntelevision channels, free ad-supported entertainment for kids and family with more than 10,000 titles, and more\nthan 50 premium subscription channels.\nThe Roku Channel model offers content that grows engagement, which accelerates advertising revenue, which then\nenables more investment in content. To further drive user engagement on our platform, in 2021, we acquired\nexclusive movies and TV shows for the first time, featuring titles that are exclusive to The Roku Channel. In May\n2021, we launched this original exclusive content as Roku Originals, which is original content exclusive to The\nRoku Channel. Our first Roku Originals consisted of content from the Quibi library, which we acquired in January\n2021. We have since greenlit second seasons of some of these shows and added original content that was not part of\nthat acquisition. We also acquired the This Old House franchise in March 2021, and launched advertising-supported\nvideo on demand (“AVOD”), ad-supported linear, and Premium Subscription channels for This Old House content on The\nRoku Channel. In 2021, we also launched the Roku Brand Studio that evolves the advertising product and enhances the\nstreaming experience for our users. Through Roku Brand Studio, Roku helps marketers go beyond the traditional\n30-second TV ad spot and offer more innovative ad experiences, such as sponsored ads in our user interface,\ninteractive video ads, branded content series, and more. Roku Originals will continue to play an important part of\nThe Roku Channel’s programming in 2022 and beyond with content investments in original programming planned to be\ncommensurate with the channel’s overall growth.\n6\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe believe that running relevant display and digital ads enhances the user experience on our platform. We generate\nplatform segment revenue by monetizing our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and\ncapabilities, including sales of subscription services and other commerce transactions, brand sponsorship and\npromotions, billing services, and video advertising in ad supported channels. Each user on our platform creates\nmultiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether they are purchasing content, enjoying ad-supported content,\nopening the Roku home page and seeing a branded takeover of our home screen, or using a Roku remote. We measure\nmonetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per user (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the\ninherent value of our business model, and growth in gross profit. In 2021, ARPU (which we measure on a trailing\ntwelve-month basis) increased from $28.76 as of December 31, 2020 to $41.03 as of December 31, 2021 and gross\nprofit for the full year grew from $808.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to $1,408.6 million as of December 31,\n2021.\nOur sophisticated and leading streaming platform enables advertisers, including content publishers, brands, and\nagencies, to reach audiences that are no longer reachable or are increasingly unavailable through advertising on\nlegacy TV. We make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through three\nprimary business models: transaction video on demand (“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte movie\npurchases or rentals, subscription video on demand that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand\nchannels and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution services, and ad-supported, which\nincludes AVOD channels with on demand content that do not charge a subscription fee to users, as well as free ad-\nsupported streaming TV (“FAST”), which we define as free, ad-supported linear streaming TV. Through Roku Pay, our\nplatform billing solution, we are also able to assist content partners with billing services, including billing\nusers for in-channel purchases like movie rentals, managing subscriptions, and customer invoices. We believe Roku\nPay is a key platform capability that simplifies user subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for\nour content publishers.\nContent publishers also have access to our media and entertainment promotional spending campaign tools to help them\nattract and retain viewers. Content publishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on\nthe Roku home screen or a screen saver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic\nto their channels in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also derive revenue from the\nsale of branded channel buttons on streaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase\nincremental usage of the channel by allowing users to launch straight into the channel from the home screen. Our\nanalytics and reporting assist content publishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles.\nUsing machine learning, we also can help content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe\nto their services.\nWe offer advertisers a unique and effective set of tools to engage with our users and our platform. Advertisers are\nable to leverage our direct relationship with our users, as well as our advertising capabilities and user data and\ninsights, to serve relevant, targeted advertisements. Roku’s first-party data is a result of our direct\nrelationship with users and is exclusively available in our Oneview ad platform. Advertisers on our platform also\ncan measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment. We offer engagement analytics\nsuch as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We work with a wide variety of\nthird-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and audience demographics,\nvalidate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform. Furthermore, we have\nrelationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data, which enables our\nadvertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on legacy TV. Additional\npromotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships to give users the opportunity to experience a\nfree movie or show and sponsored themes on our home screen. We also sell branded content rows within The Roku\nChannel.\nOneView is the ad buying platform built for TV streaming. Advertisers use OneView to set up, make changes, and\nmeasure ad campaigns entirely on their own. In a world where all TV ads will be automated and streamed, our\nsoftware and machine learning provide the best way to reach a Roku user wherever they are -- Roku, other TV\nstreaming devices, desktop, mobile, and more. Advertisers choose OneView because it is the only ad buying platform\nwith Roku data, with ad space from The Roku Channel, and with new Roku ad experiences that go beyond the legacy TV\nspot.\nBusiness Growth\nInvestment in Growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to improve the value for users, content publishers, and advertisers on our\nplatform. We must regularly update and enrich our platform to meet evolving consumer behavior and deliver a\nsuperior experience for our users, content publishers, and advertisers. Further, it is important that we remain a\nplatform for content delivery and invest to provide content publishers with best-in-class publishing tools and\nactionable audience insights. We must continue\n7\nto innovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and technology so that we attract and encourage incremental\nadvertising spend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to continue investing in our business to enhance our\ncompetitive differentiation and seed future growth. In particular, these investments will include research and\ndevelopment initiatives to bring new features and technology to our platform; sales and marketing efforts to drive\nincreased scale and engagement of our user base; continuing to invest in both licensed and original content to\ndrive incremental usage of The Roku Channel; and building out our general and administrative infrastructure to\nsupport a global scale business.\nAdvertising Innovation\nWe are expanding our total addressable market to direct-to-consumer and small/medium businesses (“SMBs”) that\ncurrently spend primarily on digital and social media platforms. We are building new advertiser products for SMBs\nto access the OneView ad platform. In 2021, we announced a new tool that will allow Shopify merchants to easily\nbuild, buy, and measure TV streaming advertising campaigns on the Roku platform. Also, in 2021, we acquired\nNielsen’s video automatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. Roku can now enable TV\nprogrammers to replace legacy TV ads with targeted ads in real-time. This means marketers can improve the consumer\nexperience by no longer running the same ad too many times to the same linear TV viewer and content owners can\nincrease ad revenue by bringing Roku data and attribution into legacy TV advertising.\nInternational Markets\nThe shift from traditional pay TV to TV streaming is a global phenomenon, as it offers consumers better choice and\ngreater control over their entertainment. We believe that the value our business delivers to consumers, content\npublishers, advertisers, TV brand partners, other device licensees, and retailers is as compelling in international\nmarkets as it is in the United States. Today our products are available in 20+ countries while the Roku OS is\navailable in six countries. We are now the #1 TV streaming platform in the United States, Mexico, and Canada by\nhours streamed. We continue to build our foundation for international expansion by establishing teams and offices\naround the world and investing in systems and processes that will support international expansion going forward. In\n2021, we expanded into Germany with our player business and launched new Roku TV models in the United Kingdom,\nBrazil, Mexico, Chile, and Peru. In international territories, we will continue to focus on building scale first,\nincreasing customer engagement, and ultimately driving monetization.\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive active account growth,\nengagement, and monetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities\nare primarily focused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands,\nretailers, and service operators, and driving sales of our streaming players and audio products and Roku TV models\nto consumers through retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships, to promote and build\nawareness of the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing\ncampaigns. We enter into distribution agreements with our content publishers and license their content through our\ndedicated content relationship management team. Our relationship with content publishers is typically client-\ndirect. We secure direct access to publishers’ video ad inventory as part of our distribution agreements and\nthrough access to programmatic ad exchanges in OneView to serve as an additional channel for content publishers to\nmonetize their audience. These sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content\npublishers. Whereas our publishers typically feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering\na large streaming audience across many channels at once using our own data. We sell advertising to a wide range of\nadvertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous key performance indicators. Our sales teams and products\nare organized into six groups that specialize in the unique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and\nFortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-market clients, (iii) content publishers and entertainment\nbrands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands, (v) international markets, and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our Roku TV brand partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\ndevelopment, planning, manufacturing, and marketing. Similarly, we work with service operators on the planning and\ndevelopment of their co-branded players.\nIn the United States, the majority of our streaming players, audio products and Roku TV models are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website. We also sell products\ninternationally through distributors and to retailers. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart collectively accounted for 69%\nof our player revenue for both\n8\nof the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and\nwork closely with these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to\ncontinue to invest significant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and streaming player sales. Our\nrevenue and gross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant\ndiscounts in the average selling prices of our player sales through retailers in an effort to grow our active\naccounts, which typically reduce our player gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, features, and functionality. We work closely with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development process that\ncaptures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features\nand enhancements to the Roku platform.\nWe intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and\nenhance our platform and capabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. All\nof our products are manufactured by our contract manufacturers in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia,\nand Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales, operations, and product management functions. The\ncontract manufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in California, the United Kingdom, Germany,\nand Brazil where we ship our products directly to retailers, wholesale distributors and to end users.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our devices and platform are subject to numerous U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign laws and\nregulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business\nregulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of internet-delivered streaming\nservices and internet-connected devices.\nFor example, in both the United States and abroad, the regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues is\nrapidly evolving. U.S. federal and state consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer\nprivacy protections and the security of online services. And an increasing number of states have passed, or are\nconsidering legislation to govern consumer privacy. Likewise, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate impose\ndifferent, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections, compared to the United States. Consumer\nprivacy laws are constantly changing and may become more diverse and restrictive over time, increasing the\nchallenges and costs associated with complying with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit\nthe ability of advertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the internet is a vital component of our business and is subject to a variety of laws and regulations\nin jurisdictions throughout the world. We historically have relied on the openness and accessibility of the\ninternet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede the preservation of the open internet\ncould harm our business. Regulators in the United States and abroad continue to evaluate policy changes that could\naffect the openness of the internet. To the extent regulators allow network operators to restrict the flow of\ncontent over the internet, such operators may seek to extract fees from us or our content publishers to deliver our\ntraffic or may otherwise engage in blocking, throttling, or other discriminatory practices with respect to our\ntraffic, which could adversely impact our business.\nFinally, our content business is subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nSome nations highly regulate media, including TV streaming. Others have (or may consider) regulations that mandate\n9\ncertain content quotas or local production requirements, for cultural preservation or other reasons. Because our\nbusiness depends on the creation and production of content, and on the availability of third-party content,\ndelivered over the internet, increased regulation of TV streaming or changes in laws or regulations governing\ninternet transmission of content could adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nAdditionally, these kinds of regulations may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive.\nNew laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, could increase our cost of doing business, impact our\ncompetitive position, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws\nand regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance with existing or future laws\nand regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and online services, data privacy and\nsecurity, consumer protection, global trade, environmental protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could\nhave an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations,\nwe may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties as well as harm to our reputation. For additional\ninformation about government regulation applicable to our business and associated risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 750 issued patents and 600 pending applications in the United States\nand foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our product\nofferings or business. For information about the intellectual property risks applicable to our business, see Item\n1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face strong\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on our ability to acquire users by delivering high quality streaming devices at competitive prices,\npartnering with Roku TV brands to bring co-branded smart TVs to market, and developing and monetizing our streaming\nplatform with compelling content, promotional services, and advertising.\nOur competitors include:\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players and Roku TV models and\ncompanies that license their operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs and well as other devices such as game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that produce and aggregate TV streaming content with the goal of attracting wide audiences;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising mediums;\ncompanies that offer users other sources for news and entertainment, including broadcast and cable television\nnetworks, newspapers and magazines, social networks, and video games; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top talent\nin engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations.\nWe also compete with other entertainment providers, including other TV streaming companies and content publishers,\nin seeking high quality content to license for our platform and for talent and programming concepts for original\ncontent projects.\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop new products and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\n10\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success depends on our culture and our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December\n31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,000 full-time employees located in 13 countries. Only our employees in Brazil\nare represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. The majority of our employees currently are\nworking from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but we expect that most employees will adopt a hybrid work\nschedule (consisting of both in-person work and working from home) in 2022.\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture emphasizes\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork, and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, our leadership communicates plans, milestones, and strategic context broadly, and our\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions.\nAs we grow our business, our goal is to ensure that Roku continues to be a great place to work and thrive. In 2021,\nwe launched our first company-wide employee engagement survey to better understand employee sentiment regarding our\nstrategy, culture, compensation and benefits, leadership, and other dimensions of the employee experience.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. We follow through on this commitment via our annual\npay equity analysis designed to ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and ethnicity, year over year;\nhiring and management trainings that incorporate topics on mitigating unconscious bias; and diverse interview\npanels that limit questions to those that are legally compliant and objectively tied to applicable job openings.\nOur Vice President of Global Talent Management and Inclusion leads a growing team that is focusing on priorities in\nfour key areas: Inclusive Employee Experiences, Inclusive Recruiting, Inclusive Communities & Social Impact, and\nInclusive Customer Advocacy.\nInclusive Employee Experiences : Our Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) Program currently supports six ERGs, which are\nvoluntary, employee-led groups intended to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace, build internal community,\nencourage career growth and networking, and support social impact partnerships. We also regularly hold educational\nemployee-led and expert-led dialogues that cover various diversity and inclusion topics, and we provide diversity\nand inclusion training and curriculum in the areas of bias, leading diverse teams, and sourcing diverse talent.\nInclusive Recruiting : Every member of our recruiting team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit\nqualified diverse candidates. In fact, all recruiters are equipped to discuss a diverse hiring strategy with every\nhiring manager to ensure we continue to widen the candidate pipeline for all roles. Our University Recruiting and\nIntern programs weave diversity and inclusion into their strategies so that we are recruiting not only from diverse\nschools but also diverse clubs and programs across all schools. Our external relationships also are focused on\norganizations that represent diverse communities, including technical and non-technical women and ethnic minority\norganizations, as well as professional Veteran’s networks, to enable our hiring managers and recruiters to attend\nor speak at diverse conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story to a wider audience.\nInclusive Communities & Social Impact : We have developed social impact programs to support employees and Roku in\nvolunteerism, charitable activities, and youth engagement.\nInclusive Customer Advocacy : As a TV streaming platform with both U.S. and international viewers, we believe our\ncustomer experiences should reflect the diversity of our customers. In 2021, we launched several “inclusion zones”\non the Roku platform that highlight and celebrate diverse stories from various content providers.\nLearning and Talent Development\nOur Learning and Talent Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to\nsupport our strategic priorities and growth. Our employee development programs begin with a comprehensive New Hire\nOnboarding experience covering our culture, business, and the resources employees need to increase their speed to\nproductivity. In addition to mandatory training covering Anti-Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, and Privacy, we\noffer employees a highly encouraged suite of training offerings such as High-Performance Feedback, Effective\nMeetings, and Communication and Presentation Skills. Managers are provided with development on Expectations for\nManagers, Interviewing and Hiring, and Performance Management to support new and newly promoted leaders in managing\nand leading effectively. In addition, all employees have access to on-demand technical and non-technical skill\ndevelopment\n11\nthrough LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase, and custom-build additional training\nmaterials to support our global employees’ performance and development needs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them if they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nGenerally, we pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offering\nspecific benefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees.

technology companies, content owners and\naggregators, TV brands, and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to differentiate\nourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users\nand our business will be harmed.\nTV streaming is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting users to and retaining\nusers on, and the effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need to be\nable to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the\ncontent they love on terms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features\nand functionality of our streaming platform for users, content publishers, and advertisers. We also must\neffectively support popular sources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime\nVideo, Disney+, Discovery+, HBO Max, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock, Netflix, and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly\nto actual and anticipated market trends in the TV streaming industry.\nLarge technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with our\nstreaming players. In addition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart\nTVs and service provider set-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into\nsmart TVs and sells Amazon-branded smart TVs. These companies have greater financial resources than we do and can\nsubsidize the cost of their streaming devices or licensing arrangements in order to promote their other products\nand services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing users, and increase streaming\nhours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or\nthat provide a better streaming experience. These companies also have greater resources to promote their brands\nthrough advertising than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service operators, such as Comcast, offer TV\nstreaming applications and devices as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing consumer\nbases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks, and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to our streaming players and our\npartners’ Roku TV models, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours,\nrevenue, gross profit or ARPU.\n14\nWe also compete for streaming hours with mobile streaming applications on smartphones and tablets, and users may\nprefer to view streaming content on such applications. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming\ncould adversely impact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue, and gross profit or the failure of our players, Roku TV models, or our platform to gain or\nmaintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming\nplatform, we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and support, and\ndevice distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards such as 8K and unknown future developments\nmay require further investments in the development of our players, Roku TV models, and our platform. We may not\nhave sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive position. In\naddition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases\nand significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than us, which provide them\nwith advantages in developing, marketing, or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they may be able to\nrespond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales, and\ndistribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than we\ncan. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and may\nbe able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our sales volume,\nrevenue, and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position, and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nTo enhance our users’ experience, we also offer audio products, including Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers,\nand Roku wireless subwoofers. As a result, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio speakers and\nsoundbars, as well as makers of other TV peripheral devices. While sales of our audio products have not generated\nmaterial amounts of revenue, if these products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku TV or other\nviewing experience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may impact the\noverall demand for Roku TV models or our other products.\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of over-the-top (“OTT”) advertising and OTT advertising\nplatforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, including digital and social media platforms, as well as traditional media, such\nas radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV, and satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content and\nother advertising mediums that may be more attractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These competitors\nare often very large and have more advertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may adversely\naffect our ability to compete for advertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from advertising. If\nwe are unable to increase our revenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s\ncapabilities to further optimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increasing our advertising inventory, and\nexpanding our advertising sales team and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be\nharmed. We may not be able to compete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our\nability to grow our advertising revenue and would harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as linear TV, radio, and print, and to advertising through digital and social media platforms. The future\ngrowth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising and on advertisers increasing their spend on\nadvertising on our platform. Although legacy TV advertisers have shown growing interest in OTT advertising, we\ncannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase or that they will not revert to legacy TV\nadvertising, especially if our users no longer stream TV or significantly reduce the amount of TV they stream as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic coming to an end, as a result of the launch of new hybrid broadcast standards (such\nas ATSC 3.0), or for other reasons. In addition, if we are unable to compete with digital and social media\nplatforms to win business from advertisers and agencies who have traditionally advertised on these platforms, such\nas direct-to-consumer and small or medium-sized businesses, our ability to grow our business may be limited. If\nadvertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive meaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may\ndevelop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our\nbusiness.\nFinally, there is political pressure in some countries to limit OTT advertising or impose local content\nrequirements on OTT services. This pressure has been driven by owners of traditional broadcast television services\nand could pose a threat to our services.\n15\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising and content distribution services. As\nsuch, we are seeking to expand the number of active accounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed\nacross our platform in an effort to create additional platform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as\nwe increase the amount of content offered and streamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our\nexpanding user base and streaming activity. The total number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with\nplatform revenue on a period-by-period basis, primarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed or every\nuser on our platform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a player or a Roku TV is\nstreaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a player is connected to a TV, and\nthe viewer turns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular\nstreaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe\nthat this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes. Since the first\nquarter of 2020, all Roku devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when content has been\ncontinuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature, which we\nrefer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the\nselected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the\nimplementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our users, channel partners, and advertisers.\nSome of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have similar features within their channels. This\nRoku OS feature supplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material\nimpact on our financial performance.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect personal viewing\ndata or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to\ncollect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our\nlegal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing\ndata from many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users. Other\nchannels available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and YouTube, are focused on\nincreasing user engagement and time spent within their channels by allowing users to purchase additional content\nand streaming services within their channels, for which we may earn less revenue than activations on or through our\nplatform. If our users spend most of their time within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to\nplace advertisements or leverage user information, or our users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in\nproviding more relevant advertisements, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or\ngross profit. If we are unable to further monetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising,\nwe will need our users to stream significantly more ad-supported content. Our efforts to monetize our streaming\nplatform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not continue to grow as we expect. This means of\nmonetization will require us to continue to attract advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as\ndeliver ad-supported content that appeals to users. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView ad platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nThrough our OneView ad platform, advertisers and advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage\ntheir OTT, desktop and mobile advertising campaigns. OneView leverages the demand-side platform (“DSP”) developed\nby dataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of our\nproprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic OTT ad buying is an emerging market, and\nour current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not shift to programmatic ad buying from other\nbuying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for programmatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or\ndevelops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising agencies may not use OneView or we may not attract\nprospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and our business could be harmed. In addition, we have\nlimited experience running a DSP, and if OneView does not have the functionality or services expected by\nadvertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be able to attract their advertising spend to OneView, or our\nexisting customers may not maintain or increase their spend on OneView. Moreover, our ownership of OneView may\nnegatively impact the ability of OneView to purchase advertising on non-Roku platforms. If we fail to adapt to our\nrapidly changing industry or to our customers’ evolving needs, advertisers and advertising agencies will not adopt\nOneView, and our business may be harmed. We also may not be\n16\nable to compete effectively with more established DSPs or be able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic OTT\nadvertising, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to develop and expand our relationships with TV brand partners in the\nUnited States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand partners and, to a\nlesser extent, service operators in both the United States and international markets. Our licensing arrangements\nare complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential partners include TV brands,\ncable and satellite companies, and telecommunication providers. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion\nof our Roku TV program both in the United States and international markets. Our licensing program for service\noperators has historically been primarily focused on international markets and has been decreasing in scale in\nrecent years, as we have shifted the focus of our international growth to the sale of Roku streaming players and\nexpanding our licensing program with TV brand partners.\nIn the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our TV brand partners has materially contributed to our active\naccount growth, to our streaming hours, and to our platform monetization efforts. This growth has primarily been in\nthe United States; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain international markets. We\nlicense the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand partners to manufacture co-branded smart\nTVs. We do not typically receive, nor do we typically expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements,\nbut we expect to incur expenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that\nwe derive from these license arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing\nour active accounts, increasing streaming hours, and generating advertising-related revenue on our platform. If\nthese arrangements do not continue to result in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth\ndoes not in turn lead to successfully monetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a TV brand partner or service operator could harm our results of operations, damage\nour reputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other partners and distribution channels, or\nincrease our marketing costs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with\nany of these third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, or other impediments to our\ndevelopment of these relationships, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited control over the amount and timing of resources these\nentities dedicate to the relationship. In the past, our TV brand partners have failed to meet their forecasts for\ndistributing licensed streaming devices, and they may fail to meet their forecasts in the future. If our TV brand\nor service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts for distributing licensed streaming devices or chose to\ndeploy competing streaming solutions within their product lines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the top three streaming services represented over 50% of all\nhours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically streamed a\nlarge percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, active accounts, or\nstreaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels and popular content. In order to remain competitive, we must\nconsistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels and content, particularly as we launch new players,\nintroduce new Roku TV models, or enter new markets, including international markets. If we are not successful in\nhelping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming channels that attract and retain a significant number\nof users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business will be\nharmed. Our ability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel offerings on a cost-\neffective basis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\n17\nIn addition, if service operators, including pay TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream certain\nchannels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of popular\nstreaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand their\naudiences on the Roku platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nMost of our agreements with content publishers are not long term and can be terminated by the content publishers\nunder certain circumstances. Any disruption in the renewal of such agreements may result in the removal of certain\nchannels from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates. Our agreements with content publishers generally have terms of one to three years and can be\nterminated before the end of the term by the content publisher under certain circumstances, such as if we\nmaterially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud, or fail to adhere to the content\npublishers’ security or other platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are\nrequired to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing content from these content publishers on our\nstreaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory\nagreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew\nsuch agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, we may be required to temporarily or permanently\nremove certain channels from our streaming platform.\nThe loss of such channels from our streaming platform for any period of time may harm our business. More broadly,\nif we fail to maintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if\nthese content publishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose channel\npartners or users and our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel has historically served as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to\nsell, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If The Roku Channel is unable to secure\ncontent that is appealing to our users and advertisers, or is unable to do so on terms that provide a sufficient\nsupply of ad inventory at reasonable cost, our supply of video ad inventory will be negatively impacted. We are\nalso dependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels. Accordingly, we do not have access to a significant portion of the video ad\ninventory on our platform. For certain channels, including YouTube’s ad-supported channel, we have no access to\nvideo ad inventory at this time, and we may not secure access in the future. The amount, quality, and cost of video\nad inventory available to us can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient supply of\nquality video ad inventory at reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our integrated advertising framework or have imposed limits on our data gathering for usage\nwithin their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our proprietary Brightscript scripting language\nin order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels on our streaming platform. If we introduce\nnew features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a change may not comply with certain content\npublishers’ certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers may find other languages, such as\nHTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing their channels on other platforms. If\nkey content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive to develop channels for, do not\nvalue and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming platform offers, or determine\nthat our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their certification requirements, our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our platform are not relevant or\nnot engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns to our users. Existing and\nprospective\n18\nadvertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and media and entertainment promotional\nspending campaigns that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and campaigns may seem irrelevant,\nrepetitive, or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of our\nadvertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but we may not be\nsuccessful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers, and content publishers.\nIf the advertising and media and entertainment promotional spending campaigns on our streaming platform are not\nrelevant or are overly intrusive and impede the use of our platform, our users may stop using our platform, which\nwill harm our business.\nThe Roku Channel may not continue to attract a large number of users or generate significant revenue from\nadvertising.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers both ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films,\ntelevision series, live linear television, and other content. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs\nand expenses in connection with the development, expansion, and operation of The Roku Channel, which we monetize\nprimarily through advertising. For example, in 2021, we acquired content rights, including rights to certain\nprojects in development, from the mobile-first video distribution service known as Quibi, and announced that The\nRoku Channel would become the home of such content. In addition, we acquired the entities comprising the This Old\nHouse business, which own and produce the “This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” TV programs and operate related\nbusiness lines, to further the growth strategy and ad-supported content offerings in The Roku Channel.\nIf our users do not continue to stream the ad-supported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not\nhave the opportunity to monetize The Roku Channel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract\nusers to the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku\nChannel, we must secure rights to stream content that is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do\nthis by directly licensing certain content from content owners, such as television and movie studios. The\nagreements that we enter into with these content owners have varying terms and provide us with rights to make\nspecific content available through The Roku Channel during certain periods of time. Upon expiration of these\nagreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these agreements with the content owners, or enter into new\nagreements with other content owners, in order to obtain rights to distribute additional titles or to extend the\nduration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable to enter into content license agreements on acceptable\nterms to access content that enables us to attract and retain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku\nChannel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream (including, for example, the content that we acquired\nthrough the Quibi and This Old House transactions) is ultimately not appealing to our users and advertisers, usage\nof The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, following the Quibi and This Old House transactions and the launch of our advertising brand studio, we\nare producing content for distribution on The Roku Channel and other platforms. We have limited experience\nproducing content, and we may not be successful in doing so in a cost-effective manner that is appealing to our\nusers and advertisers and furthers the growth of The Roku Channel. We also take on risks associated with content\nproduction, such as completion and key talent risk. Furthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not\nrelevant to our users or such advertisements are overly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available\ncontent, our users may not stream content and view advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not\ngenerate sufficient revenue from advertising to be cost effective for us to operate. In addition, we distribute The\nRoku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in attracting a large number of users or generating significant revenue from advertising through the\ndistribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform, including Premium Subscriptions on The Roku Channel, which allow our users to pay for content from\nvarious content publishers. If users reduce the degree to which they use our platform for these purchases or\nsubscriptions for any reason, and instead increase the degree to which they pay for services directly with content\npublishers or by other means for which we do not receive attribution, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming services from\nwithin their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is not always equivalent to the revenue we earn\nfrom sales of such additional services on a stand-alone basis through our platform. If users increase their\nspending on such in-channel transactions at the expense of stand-alone purchases through our platform, our business\nmay be harmed.\n19\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that are outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access\n(including mobile broadband internet access), the quality and reliability of broadband content delivery, broadband\nservice providers’ ability to control the delivery speed of different content traveling on their networks, the\nquality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for users relative to other sources of content, as\nwell as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms. Accordingly, the future\nevolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact our success, is dependent on many of the\nfactors that are outside of our control.\nWe and our Roku TV brand partners depend on our retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our players\nand Roku TV models, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we could\nexperience lower player or Roku TV model sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand our retail sales channels. The majority of\nour players and our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such\nas Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon. We\nalso sell players directly through our website and internationally through distributors and retailers such as\nCoppel in Mexico, Magazine Luiza in Brazil, and MediaMarkt in Germany. As we have only recently expanded to certain\ninternational markets, we may not have established a strong reputation or relationships with global retailers as\ncompared to our domestic operations or our competitors in international markets. Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in\ntotal accounted for 69% of our player revenue for both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our retailers\nand distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-\nterm contracts with any of these retailers or distributors. If one or several retailers or distributors were to\ndiscontinue selling our players or our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models, choose not to prominently display those\ndevices in their stores or on their websites, or close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations\ndue to COVID-19 restrictions or other concerns, the volume of our streaming devices or our TV brand partners’ Roku\nTV models sold could decrease, which would harm our business. If any of our existing TV brand partners choose to\nwork exclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to other operating system\ndevelopers, this may impact our ability to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference design to TV brands and\nour ability to continue to grow active accounts. Traditional retailers have limited shelf and end cap space in\ntheir stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website product placement\nspace. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines, stronger\nbrand identity and greater marketing resources, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with\nretailers. In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices and smart\nTVs, is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or\npromote our devices on its website. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our devices, or increased\ncompetition for available shelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing expenditures to\nmaintain our product visibility or result in reduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In\nparticular, the availability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is\ncritical to our revenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our devices during these periods, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time-consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nplayers or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of Roku\nTV models and the quality of the content that our content publishers provide, may be out of our control, yet users\nmay nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness\nand market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and may\nhave greater resources to devote to the promotion of their brands through traditional advertising, digital\nadvertising or website product placement. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand, it may be\ndifficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace, therefore\nour ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from thousands of channels, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and watch,\nand they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to our streaming devices. While we have\npolicies\n20\nthat prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities, or violates third-party\nrights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content. Controversies related to\nthe content included on certain channels that we distribute have resulted in, and could in the future result in,\nnegative publicity, cause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers. This credit risk may\nvary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In addition, typically, we are\ncontractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated period of time, regardless\nof whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In addition, we typically experience\nslow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While we attempt to balance\npayment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not always successful. As a\nresult, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivables,\nrequiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our streaming platform or\nthrough our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies, and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important, and if we fail to provide adequate levels of customer support, we\ncould lose users and TV brand partners or other licensees, which would harm our business.\nOur users depend on our customer support organization to resolve any issues relating to our devices. A high level\nof support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our devices. We currently outsource the majority of\nour customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization which provides support to end users\nof our players and audio products. In addition, we train our TV brand partners and service operator licensees to\nprovide first-level customer support to users of Roku TV models and co-branded players. If we do not effectively\ntrain, update, and manage our third-party customer support organization to assist our users and licensees, and if\nthat support organization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing\nsupport, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our devices to users and harm our reputation with potential\nnew users and our licensees.\nWe must successfully manage streaming device and other product introductions and transitions to remain competitive.\nWe must continually develop new and improved streaming devices and other products that meet changing consumer\ndemands. Moreover, the introduction of a new streaming device or other new product is a complex task, involving\nsignificant expenditures in research and development, promotion, and sales channel development. For example, in\nrecent years, we introduced Roku Streambars, Roku wireless speakers, and Roku wireless subwoofers, among other\nproducts. Whether users will broadly adopt new streaming devices or other new products is not certain. Our future\nsuccess will depend on our ability to develop new and competitively priced streaming devices and other new products\nand add new desirable content and features to our streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new streaming\ndevices and other new products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and we must secure production orders for\nthose products from our contract manufacturers. The development of new streaming devices and other new products is\na highly complex process, and while our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex\nproblems, we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. The successful development and introduction\nof new streaming devices and other new products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near-term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing, or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nour ability to timely and adequately redesign or resolve design or manufacturing issues;\nour ability to identify and contract with an appropriate manufacturer;\n21\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\ntariffs, trade, sanctions, and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments, which could impact the\npricing, timing and availability of such devices and depress consumer demand, limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies, and lead to shortages;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to produce quality products and minimize defects, manufacturing\nmishaps, and shipping delays; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers, and\nour operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players and audio products. Our contract manufacturers are vulnerable to, among other issues:\ncapacity constraints;\nreduced component availability;\nproduction, supply chain, or shipping disruptions or delays, including from strikes, mechanical issues, quality\ncontrol issues, natural disasters, and public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs, trade, or sanctions restrictions on components, finished goods, software,\nother products, or data transfers.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new streaming devices or other products. For example, in 2021,\nglobal supply chain disruptions led to increased component costs and shipping costs for our products, which\nnegatively affected our player gross margin. We expect that global supply chain disruptions will continue in 2022,\nand our player gross margin may continue to be adversely affected.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our players and other products to our quality and performance standards and specifications.\nDelays, component shortages, quality issues, and other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail\ndistribution of our players and other products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our\ncontract manufacturers’ financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our players or other\nproducts to our retailers and distributors.\nWe also rely upon our contract manufacturers to perform some of the development work on our products. The contract\nmanufacturers may be unwilling or unable to successfully complete desired development. Delays in development work\nby contract manufacturers could delay launch of new or improved products.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally may not contain terms that protect us against development,\nmanufacturing, and supply disruptions or risks. For example, such contracts may not obligate our contract\nmanufacturers to supply our players or other products in any specific quantity or at any specific price. If our\ncontract manufacturers are unable to fulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, if their costs\nincrease because of inflationary pressures, U.S. or international tariffs, sanctions, export or import\nrestrictions, or if they decide to terminate their relationship with us, our order fulfillment may be delayed or\nterminated, and we would have to attempt to identify, select, and qualify acceptable alternative contract\nmanufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a\nposition to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance\nstandards on a timely basis, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers\nfor any reason could require us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and\ndistributors, which in turn would reduce our revenue, or incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would\nnegatively impact our player gross margin. In addition, our contract manufacturers’ facilities are located in\nSoutheast Asia, the People’s Republic of China, and Brazil and may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade,\npublic health, social, and legal uncertainties that may harm or disrupt our relationships with these parties or\ntheir ability to perform. We believe that the international location of these facilities increases supply risk,\nincluding the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade restrictions on exports or imports.\n22\nThe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if our Roku TV brand partners encounter problems with\ntheir internal operations or contract manufacturers or suppliers.\nCertain of our Roku TV brand partners have internal manufacturing capabilities and others primarily rely upon\ncontract manufacturers to build the Roku TV models that they sell to retailers. Regardless of whether their\nmanufacturing capabilities are internal or contracted, our Roku TV brand partners’ manufacturers may be vulnerable\nto capacity constraints and reduced component availability; increases in U.S. tariffs on imports of Roku TV models;\nfuture possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies; U.S. restrictions on dealings with\ncertain countries, parties, regions, or imported inputs; foreign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for Roku TV\nmodels that are assembled outside of the United States; and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays. Their\ncontrol over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when components are in short supply,\nmay be limited. For those Roku TV brand partners with contract manufacturers or suppliers, the problems are\nexacerbated because the contract manufacturer is a third party, and the Roku TV brand partner does not have direct\nvisibility into or control over the operations. Delays, component shortages, and other manufacturing and supply\nproblems (whether due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the current high demand for consumer electronics and\ninformation technology products, or other reasons) could impair the retail distribution of their Roku TV models.\nInterruptions in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors at times have affected, and could\nadversely affect in the future, our active accounts and streaming hours. For example, in 2021, some of our Roku TV\nbrand partners faced supply chain and inventory challenges that negatively impacted their unit sales, which we\nbelieve affected our streaming hours and active account growth.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality or performance of our Roku TV brand partners’ Roku TV\nmodels could harm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements and manage our inventory with our contract\nmanufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays, and lose revenue.\nWe bear risks of excess and insufficient inventories under our contract manufacturing arrangements. For example,\nour contract manufacturers order materials and components in advance in an effort to meet our projected needs for\nour products. Lead times for the materials and components that our contract manufacturers order on our behalf\nthrough different component suppliers may vary significantly and depend on numerous factors outside of our control,\nincluding the specific supplier, contract terms, shipping and air freight, market demand for a component at a given\ntime, and trade and government relations. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our\nplayers or other products are currently lengthy and may require our contract manufacturers to order materials and\ncomponents many months in advance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may\npurchase excess components and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase\nexcess components or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products. In\nthe past, we have agreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were not used as a\nresult of our decision to discontinue a certain model of player or the use of particular components. If we incur\ncosts to cover excess supply commitments, this would harm our business.\nConversely, if we underestimate our player or other product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have\ninadequate material or component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our players or other\nproducts, result in insufficient quantities available to meet demand, and result in delays or cancellation of\norders from retailers and distributors. In addition, from time to time we have experienced unanticipated increases\nin demand that resulted in the need to ship players via air freight, which is more expensive than ocean freight,\nand adversely affected our player gross margin during such periods of high demand (for example, during end-of-year\nholidays). Throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, shipping delays, and sustained high\ndemand for consumer electronics and information technology products created tight component supply conditions and\nlogistical delays for our products and key components, which adversely impacted our player gross margin. If we fail\nto accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements, our business may be harmed.\nOur players and other products incorporate key components from sole source suppliers, and if our contract\nmanufacturers are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on a timely basis, we will not be able\nto deliver our products to our retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our players and other products. For example, each of our\nplayers may utilize a specific system on chip (or SoC), Wi-Fi silicon product, and Wi-Fi front-end module, each of\nwhich may be available from only a single manufacturer and for which we do not have a second source. Although this\napproach allows us to maximize product performance on lower cost hardware, reduce engineering development and\nqualification costs, and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers, this also creates supply\nchain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity issues or material supply\nissues, such as U.S. or foreign tariffs, war or other government or trade relations issues, other export or import\nrestrictions on parts or components for finished\n23\nproducts that are used in final assembly of their components (or on the finished products themselves), or shortages\nof key components. There is also the risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease\noperations, be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors or other companies, put\ncontract manufacturers on allocation because of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, or become subject to\nU.S. or foreign sanctions or export control restrictions or penalties. Such suppliers also have experienced, and\nmay continue to experience, production, shipping, or logistical constraints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch interruptions and delays have forced us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which have not\nalways been available, and have caused us to delay product introductions and incur air freight expense. Switching\nfrom a sole-source supplier may require that we adapt our software, and redesign our products to accommodate new\nchips and components, and may require us to re-qualify our products with regulatory bodies, such as the U.S.\nFederal Communications Commission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases, including increases related to inflationary pressures;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our products could adversely affect our ability to\nmeet scheduled product deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses, and\nharm our business.\nOur players and Roku TV models must operate with various offerings, technologies, and systems from our content\npublishers that we do not control. If our streaming devices do not operate effectively with those offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed for performance using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth\nwith our players and Roku TV models offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be\ninteroperable with all channels and other offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers,\nincluding virtual multi-channel video programming distributors. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies, and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if our players and Roku TV models do\nnot provide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with our players or Roku TV models, we may be unable to increase\nactive account growth and user engagement or may be required to increase our hardware costs, and our business will\nbe harmed. We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly, and we have experienced that it takes time to\noptimize such products to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our\nlargest content publishers have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their channels\non these devices. The certification processes can be time consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our\nproduct release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make\nchanges in order to obtain certifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, we may not be able\nto offer certain products to all TV brand partners or we may not continue to offer certain channels. To continue to\ngrow our active accounts and user engagement, we will need to prioritize development of our streaming devices to\nwork better with new offerings, technologies, and systems. If we are unable to maintain consistent operability of\nour devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms, our business could be harmed. In addition, any\nfuture changes to offerings, technologies, and systems from our content publishers, such as virtual service\noperators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and other performance aspects of our streaming\ndevices. We may not successfully develop streaming devices that operate effectively with these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use these offerings,\ntechnologies, or systems, our business could be harmed.\nOur streaming devices are technically complex and may contain undetected hardware errors or software bugs, which\ncould manifest themselves in ways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur streaming devices and the products of our TV brand partners are technically complex and have contained and may\nin the future contain undetected software bugs or hardware errors. These bugs and errors can manifest themselves in\nany number of ways in our devices or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security\nvulnerabilities, data quality in logs or interpretation of data, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled\ndevices. Some errors in our devices may only be discovered after a device has been shipped and used by users and\nmay in some cases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We also update the Roku OS\nand our software on a regular basis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce bugs in the\nprocess of any such update. The introduction of a serious software bug could result in devices becoming permanently\ndisabled. We offer a limited one-year warranty in the United States, although applicable law or our software\nupdates could cause us to be responsible for issues\n24\nwith devices after this period of time. Any defects discovered in our devices after commercial release could result\nin loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users, and increased service\ncosts, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We could also face claims\nfor product or information liability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or regulations. In\naddition, our contracts with users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations,\nwhich may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s\nattention and adversely affect the market’s perception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance\ncoverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be\nharmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design, or other defects over which we have\nno control and render our devices permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors or defects in our\nproducts that could harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design, or other defect, they can\ncause our products to fail and render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by which our\nusers connect their home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network router. If\nthe Wi-Fi receiver in our player fails, then our player cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access point, and our\nplayer will not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to recall and\nreplace these players at our sole cost and expense. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our\nreputation in the market could be adversely affected, and our replacement of these players would harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to develop new\nstreaming players or platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize commercially available off-the-shelf technology in the development of our players and streaming\nplatform. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to our players and our streaming platform, we\nmay be required to license additional technologies from third parties. These third-party licenses may be\nunavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain necessary third-party\nlicenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies with lower quality or performance standards, or at a\ngreater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of our players, streaming platform, and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and although we have achieved profitability in recent quarters, we\nmay not be able to maintain or grow our profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, and we may incur operating losses in the future. Although we have\nachieved profitability in recent quarters, we may not be able to maintain or grow our profitability. As of December\n31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $90.0 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the\nfuture as we continue to expand our operations and invest in growth and new areas. If our revenue and gross profit\ndo not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we may not be able to maintain and grow our\nprofitability. We expect our profitability to fluctuate in the future for a number of reasons, including without\nlimitation the other risks and uncertainties described herein. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating\nor legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors that may result in losses in future\nperiods.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit, and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-\nto-year and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new companies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users, and\nmonetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices in response to the competitive markets in which we operate or\nother macroeconomic factors, such as increased taxes or inflationary pressures, such as those the market is\ncurrently experiencing, and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\n25\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\nseasonal, cyclical, or other shifts in revenue from advertising or player sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels, or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license or produce for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our players or our TV brand partners’ Roku TV models;\ndelays in delivery of our players or our partners’ Roku TV models, or disruptions in our or our TV brand\npartners’ supply or distribution chains, including any disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs, or\nother trade restrictions or disruptions; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations, or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our player segment has lower gross margins\ncompared to our platform segment (which generates revenue from digital advertising sales and related services,\ncontent distribution services, and licensing arrangements). Gross margins on our players vary across models and can\nchange over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, player\nreturns, and other cost fluctuations. In addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as\noverall profitability, may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic, or sales channel\nmix, component cost increases, price competition, or the introduction of new streaming devices, including those\nthat have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future\nstrategically reduce our player gross margin in an effort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our\ngross profit. As a result, our player revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and,\nunless we are able to continue to increase our platform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be\nunable to grow gross profit and our business will be harmed. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our player gross\nmargin was negative due to rising component and shipping costs. Though we do not believe that the increased\ncomponent and shipping costs are permanent, they may continue to impact us in the near future and are expected to\ncause player gross margin to be negative until such conditions normalize. If a reduction in gross margin does not\nresult in an increase in our active accounts or an increase our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial\nresults may suffer, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our players;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nsupport a larger number of TV brand partners and service operators;\nexpand and improve the content offering on our platform;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our business\nwill be harmed.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations, and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing, and supporting our devices and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our devices and\nstreaming platform services. Moreover, we face intense competition in international markets, especially because\nsome of our\n26\ncompetitors have already successfully introduced their products into new markets we are entering and have greater\nexperience managing a global organization.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely\naffect our business, including:\ndiffering legal and regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, including country-specific laws and\nregulations pertaining to data privacy and data security, consumer protection, tax, telecommunications, trade\n(including tariffs, quotas, and sanctions), labor, environmental protection, censorship and other content\nrestrictions, and local content and advertising requirements, among others;\ncompliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws,\nU.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials\nand requiring the maintenance of accurate books and records and a system of sufficient internal controls;\nslower consumer adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, competition with other devices that\nconsumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional pay and over-the-air TV services and products,\nincluding those provided by incumbent TV service providers and local consumer electronics companies;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing our streaming devices and streaming platform, including delivering\nsupport and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions, social unrest or economic instability, whatever the cause, including\ndue to pandemics, natural disasters, wars, terrorist activity, foreign invasions (such as the potential Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine), tariffs, trade disputes, local or global recessions, diplomatic or economic tensions, long-\nterm environmental risks, or climate change;\nadverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws (including increased tax rates, the\nimposition of digital services taxes, and the adoption of global corporate minimum taxes and anti-base-erosion\nrules), changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, and the heightened scrutiny by tax administrators of\ncompanies that have cross-border business activities;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, in the event that the World\nTrade Organization fails to extend the current moratorium on such duties;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemics or epidemics, which could result in decreased economic activity in\ncertain markets, decreased use of our products or platform, or decreased ability to import, export, ship, or sell\nour products to supply such services to existing or new customers in international markets;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the global market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for\nmaterials, supplies, and services;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact the revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality, and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we recognize significant discounts in the\naverage selling prices of our player sales through retailers in an effort to grow our active accounts, which\ntypically reduce our player gross margin in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our device sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, disruptions in our supply or distribution chains, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, shipping or\nair freight delays, or for any other reason,\n27\nwould cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, delays or disruptions at U.S.\nports of entry have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our or our distributors’ ability to timely\ndeliver players and Roku TV models to retailers during holiday seasons. A substantial portion of our expenses are\npersonnel-related (including salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits) and facilities-related, none of\nwhich are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue shortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the\nnegative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in the short term, and our business would be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our devices and streaming platform, our culture, and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Labor is subject\nto external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and workforce participation rates. Our employees,\nparticularly engineers and other product developers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to\nidentifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating, and retaining these employees. Because we face significant\ncompetition to attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive\ncompensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, the recent move by\ncompanies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment may increase the competition for such employees from\nemployers outside of our traditional office locations. To retain employees, we also may need to increase our\nemployee compensation levels in response to competition. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional\nskilled employees necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nmany of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, the equity ownership of many of our\nemployees could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition, and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and\nother licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business, are increasingly\ncomplex. To manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational\nand financial systems, procedures, and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on\nmanual operations. An inability to do so will negatively affect our financial reporting, billing, and payment\nservices. Our current and planned systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our complex\narrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth.\nDelays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and\ncontrols could adversely affect our relationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement\nagencies, Roku TV brand partners, or other licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and result in errors\nin our financial and other reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products, or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base, and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could\n28\nbe material to our financial condition and results of operations, and any anticipated benefits from an acquisition\nmay never materialize. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence\nof debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose\nus to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient\nfinancial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions. In addition, the process of\nintegrating acquired businesses, products, or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures, in particular when the acquired businesses, products, or technologies involve areas of operation in\nwhich we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays, or other operational problems, and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully, our business could be harmed.\nWe have outstanding debt, and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement, dated February 9, 2019 (as amended on May 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”)\namong us, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders and\nissuing banks from time to time party thereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent (the “Agent”), providing for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal\namount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement contains a number of\naffirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability\nto respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions. The Credit Agreement also\ncontains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00,\ntested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the prior period of our four consecutive fiscal\nquarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a security interest in substantially all of our\nand our subsidiary guarantors’ assets. In November 2019, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100.0\nmillion from the Term Loan A Facility. We also had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2021, totaling\n$38.0 million against the Revolving Credit Facility. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and\nRevolving Credit Facilities” elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. However, if we\nfail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo any other event\nof default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which would give it the\nright to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the Agent would have the\nright to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If the outstanding\ndebt under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient\nassets to repay it, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on the one-month\nU.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate.\nIf we borrow pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we are permitted to choose LIBOR as the benchmark for\nestablishing the applicable interest rate as well. LIBOR, which is calculated and published for various currencies\nand periods by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”), is in the process of being phased out. The IBA has\nceased publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and intends to cease publication of\nall other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (including the one-month setting) after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, in the\nnear future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and\nother pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past,\nincluding during the transition period. Although our Credit Agreement will expire in February 2023 (before the\ncessation of the publication of the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR setting), the consequences of the LIBOR\ndevelopments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our LIBOR-linked\nfinancial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our Credit Agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new devices and enhance our streaming\n29\nplatform, continue to expand the content on our platform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our\nretail partners’ demand requirements, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses,\npersonnel, and technologies. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as personnel-related expenses\nand capital spending. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors including our growth rate and the continuing market acceptance of our streaming platform,\nthe Roku OS, and players, along with the timing and effort related to the introduction of new platform features,\nplayers, hiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as overall\neconomic conditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those\nof holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses, and\nan acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain\nadequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be\nharmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices, and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate, personal,\nand other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment card\ninformation, other user information, employee information, and other confidential information. It is critical that\nwe do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. Our\nobligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other\ndocumentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information in\nour possession or control, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as part of an information\nsecurity program, and limits on the use or cross-border transfer of such personal information. These obligations\ncreate potential legal liability to regulators, our business partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders\nand impact the attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits, and stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information), and as a\nresult, we manage a number of third-party vendors and other partners who may or could have access to our\ninformation technology systems (including our computer networks) or to our confidential information. In addition,\nmany of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. As a\nresult, our information technology systems, including the functions of third parties that are involved in or have\naccess to those systems, are very large and complex. While all information technology operations are inherently\nvulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks, and exposures, the size,\ncomplexity, accessibility, and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the large amounts of\nsensitive or personal information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to unintentional or\nmalicious, internal, and external threats on our technology environment. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from\ninadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third\nparties. For example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in\nthose systems, including our efforts to educate or train our employees, we and our third-party vendors have\nexperienced, and remain vulnerable to, data security incidents, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and\nimproper employee access of confidential data. Malicious attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of\npersistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and\nindividuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise,\nincluding organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states, and others.\nAlthough we have implemented work from home protocols and offer work-issued devices to employees, the actions of\nour employees while working from home may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the data we\nprocess, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, intellectual property, or data arising from\nemployees’ combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe\n30\ndo not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network. These\nrisks have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are\ncontinuing to work from home as a result of government guidelines and internal policies adopted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information or\nintellectual property, other threats include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the\nnature of our third-party web hosting, cloud computing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our\nsystems regularly experience directed attacks that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’,\ncontent publishers’, and advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; or view or obtain our\ndata (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information) or\nintellectual property. We cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or\nservices in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to\nprotect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the\nthreat landscape as well as the impact that third-party vendors and third-party products may have on our\ncybersecurity. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and\nransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware\ntechniques and methodology. Ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks affecting our third-party vendors also may\nimpact our ability to operate our business, such as when our information technology or human resources vendors\nexperience an outage of their systems, which renders services to downstream customers unavailable. Additionally,\nour third-party vendors or business partners’ information technology systems, or hardware/software provided by such\nthird parties for use in our information technology systems, may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business\ncould be affected by those or similar third-party relationships. Open source software, which may be incorporated\ninto our systems or products, inherently presents a large attack surface and may contain vulnerabilities of which\nwe are not aware and which we cannot control or fully mitigate. For example, the Apache Log4j vulnerability\ndiscovered in December 2021 can be exploited by remote code execution, which can allow a bad actor to steal data or\ntake over our systems. We have taken steps to patch this vulnerability by updating our relevant Apache software,\nbut we, and the many other affected organizations, remain vulnerable in light of the widespread use of the Apache\nLog4i library and difficulty in identifying all instances of this library across an entire enterprise.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that our insurance policies may not cover some or all\naspects of a security incident. Insurance policies will also not protect against the reputational harms caused by a\nmajor security incident. Even where an incident is covered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not cover the\ncosts of complete remediation and redress that we may be faced with in the wake of a security incident. The\nsuccessful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators, or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Any attempts by threat actors to disrupt our platform, our streaming devices,\nwebsite, computer systems, or our mobile apps, if successful, could harm our business, subject us to liability, be\nexpensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations, and damage our reputation. Efforts to prevent threat\nactors from entering our computer systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in our devices are expensive to implement\nand may not be effective in detecting or preventing intrusion or vulnerabilities. Such unauthorized access to our\ndata could damage our reputation and our business and could expose us to the risk of contractual damages,\nlitigation, and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm our business. The risk of harm to our business\ncaused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our product and service offerings and as we enter into\nnew markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security safeguards requires substantial resources now and\nwill likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ or commercial partners’ information technology systems or other\nsimilar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\nforeign invasions, and telecommunications and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our\nproduct development and our business operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot\n31\ndiscovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to systems,\nand many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to\nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal information\nregarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal\nor state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming, distracting, and\nexpensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the\ncorrectness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations, and contractual\nobligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in\nincreased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure or reputational harm. For example, in\nthe wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties and related\nenforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment Card\nIndustry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data. Penalties\narising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities within\nthe payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us, our vendors, or our business partners to comply with our\nprivacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further\nsecurity incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release, or transfer\nof sensitive information (which could include personal information), may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us (including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system, or networks as less desirable) or we could be subject to claims\nby third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable,” “appropriate,” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate, or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be\nable to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs and reputational harm.\nWe and our service providers collect, process, transmit, and store personal and confidential information, which\ncreates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and store personal or confidential information about our users (and their devices),\nemployees, and partners, and we rely on third-party service providers to collect, process, transmit, and store\npersonal or confidential information of our users (including our users’ payment card data), employees, and\npartners. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may store\nor process such information outside the country in which it was collected. Further, we, our service providers and\nour business partners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers, and related technologies,\nto help us manage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website, and partners’ content to\ndeliver relevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners on our devices.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data, as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our, our\nservice providers’, or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers, licensors, and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws,\nregulations, and industry standards. For example, certain European Union (“EU”) laws and regulations prohibit\naccess to or storage of information on a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for\nadvertising) that is not “strictly necessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of\na transmission unless the user has provided consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection\nof information which is used for advertising purposes. Additionally, certain device manufacturers or operating\nsystem providers may restrict the deployment of cookies and similar technologies, or otherwise restrict the\ncollection of personal information through these or other tools, via our applications. Any restrictions on our\n32\nability to collect or use data could harm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which\ndepends on engaging the relevant recipients of advertising campaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing, and\nsecurity of the data we receive from and about our users, employees, and other individuals. The regulatory\nenvironment for the collection and use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers,\ncontent distributors, advertisers, and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy and\nconsumer rights groups and government bodies (including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys\ngeneral, the European Commission, European and UK data protection authorities, and the Brazilian national data\nprotection authority), have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that identify or are\nidentifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the internet, and we\nexpect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The U.S. federal government, U.S. states, and foreign governments\nhave enacted (or are considering) laws and regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’\nability to collect, use, and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and\nconsent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For example, the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, and use of\npersonal information related to people located in the EU (or which is processed in the context of EU operations)\nand places new data protection obligations and restrictions on organizations, and may require us to make further\nchanges to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what we have already done. In addition, in the wake of\nthe United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the United Kingdom has adopted a framework similar to the\nGDPR. The EU has recently confirmed that the UK data protection framework as being “adequate” to receive EU\npersonal data. We are monitoring recent developments regarding amendments to the UK data protection framework and\nthe impact this may have on our business.\nWe made changes to our data protection compliance program to prepare for the GDPR and will continue to monitor the\nimplementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not compliant with GDPR or other data\nprotection laws or regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such\nas restrictions on personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For example, under the GDPR,\nfines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, as well as data processing restrictions,\ncould be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Data protection laws continue to proliferate\nthroughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For example, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law\n(“LGPD”) came into effect in August 2020. The LGPD bears many substantive similarities to the GDPR such as extra-\nterritorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data transfer restrictions, and mandatory breach\nnotification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a company’s annual revenue in Brazil.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with various states having enacted broad-based\ndata privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider\nadditional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an\neffort to comply. For example, effective October 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information\nLaw (“SPI Law”) to require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to\nintake requests from consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. Effective January 2020, the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal\ninformation, such as rights to access, and require deletion of, their personal information, opt out of the sale of\ntheir personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA\nalso provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may\nincrease data breach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1,\n2023 (with a “look-back” to January 1, 2022), builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment\nof a dedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy issues. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted laws introducing\nnew privacy obligations for which we may need to take additional steps to comply. We are continuing to assess the\nimpact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments to existing laws on our\nbusiness. Such restrictions could, for example, limit our ability to supply targeted advertising and thus\nnegatively impact our business.\nIn addition, each U.S. state and most U.S. territories, each EU member state, and the United Kingdom, as well as\nmany other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring notification to regulatory authorities, affected users, or\nothers within a specific timeframe when there has been a security breach involving, or other unauthorized access to\nor acquisition or disclosure of, certain personal information and impose additional obligations on companies.\nAdditionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event of a\nsecurity breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause\nour users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and may require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\n33\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United\nStates. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United\nStates, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to\nthe United States. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be an\ninvalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues\nregarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. In 2021, the European Commission\npublished updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within\nprescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal information outside of the EEA. The United\nKingdom is expected to publish final versions of its own Model Clauses in 2022. Updating agreements to incorporate\nthese new Model Clauses for the EEA and United Kingdom may require significant time and resources to implement,\nincluding through adjusting our operations, conducting requisite data transfer assessments, and revising our\ncontracts. In addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened scrutiny\nfrom EU regulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer personal\ninformation outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate. We continue to assess\nthe available regulatory guidance, determinations, and enforcement actions from EU Data Protection Authorities and\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce on international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on\nspecific supplementary measures in addition to the Model Clauses as well as specific data sharing that may be\ndeemed a cross-border transfer for which appropriate safeguards must be implemented. Our ability to continue to\ntransfer personal information outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to\nincreased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or other legal frameworks, and we may experience operating\ndisruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter\nrequirements for certain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted “data localization” laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their respective countries be maintained, stored, or processed in their respective countries.\nMaintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect\nthat, in addition to the “business as usual” costs of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and\nenforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection laws, will\nlead to increased operational and compliance costs and will require us to continually monitor and, where necessary,\nmake changes to our operations, policies, and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-\nrelated legal obligations, or any compromise of security of user data, may result in governmental enforcement\nactions, litigation, contractual indemnities, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or\nothers. In addition to potential liability, these events could harm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices, and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information, and other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving\ncompliance if our employees, representatives, agents, vendors, or other third parties fail to comply with our\npublished policies, certifications, and documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international,\nlocal, state, and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual\npractices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use, and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing\nlaws, enactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase\nour cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the performance and operation of the\nRoku OS, streaming platform, and computer systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software, or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our devices\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users or otherwise disrupt our business. We utilize computer\nsystems located either in our facilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-\nbased or cloud computing services. Although we\n34\ngenerally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over their operations,\nwhich makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays that they may experience. In the future, we may\ntransition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud computing services, which\nmay require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to manage such a transition\neffectively, we may experience a loss or degradation in services, operational delays, or inefficiencies until the\ntransition is complete. Upon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we\nmay not be able to replace their services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels\nand cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to\noperational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes,\nwars, foreign invasions, terrorist activity, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar\nevents could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. As we do not maintain entirely\nredundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations, products, or services\nand could adversely affect our business. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could have\nadverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations, and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform\nperformance. To the extent that we or our third-party service hosting providers do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade or patch systems as needed, and continually develop technology and network architecture to\naccommodate increasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated\nchanges in technology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain high-speed access to the\ninternet at reasonable cost, which relies in part on internet service network operators’ continuing willingness to\nupgrade and maintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their\ncontinued willingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over\nnetwork operators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, disruptions, or delays in their operations, as well as\nany decision they may make to prioritize the delivery of certain network traffic at the expense of other traffic.\nAny material disruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business, or decreased demand\nfor our services, if network operators engage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in\nan effort to monetize access to their networks or customers by data providers.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to\nstreaming video content have been implemented in many countries, including in the EU. In other countries, laws in\nthis area may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change. Given the uncertainty around\nthese laws and the rules that implement them, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal, coupled\nwith potentially significant political and economic power of network operators, we could experience discriminatory\nor anti-competitive practices, such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, and traffic “shaping” or throttling,\nthat could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of service, cause us to incur additional expense,\nor otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, all of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also offer consumers\nmultichannel video programming, and some network operators also own streaming services. These network operators\nhave an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of\nother companies seeking to distribute similar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to\nprovide preferential treatment to their own data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our devices and\nstreaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs, or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology, and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow\n35\nand face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us will grow.\nPlaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and pending patent\napplications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent litigation or other\nproceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been or could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be better\nable to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their substantially greater financial\nresources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant management time and divert\nmanagement from our business. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or\nother proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing\ncould harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing, or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent, or materials; and indemnify our partners and other third parties. For example, we have in the past elected\nto develop and implement specific design changes to address potential risks that certain products could otherwise\nbecome subject to exclusion or cease and desist orders arising from patent infringement and other intellectual\nproperty claims brought in the U.S. International Trade Commission. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to, or are unable to, protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business\nand operating results could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, and\nother intellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek\nto protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all of our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and any third\nparties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology. However, we cannot be certain that\nwe have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who\nhad access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. Any\nparty with whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach that agreement and disclose our\nproprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be\ndisclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop\nsubstantially equivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret\nand enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-\nconsuming, and could result in substantial costs, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our\ncompetitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a\ncompetitive advantage in our market, which could harm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. U.S. patent laws,\nand the scope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change\nto “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result\n36\nin inventors and companies having to file patent applications more frequently to preserve rights in their\ninventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to file more patent applications. Another\nchange to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any issued patent in the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an action in U.S. federal court. Any\ninvalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to protect the innovations contained\nwithin our devices and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment, and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with these\nrequirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete\nloss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. In particular, our actions to monitor\nand enforce our trademarks against third parties may not prevent counterfeit versions of our products or products\nbearing confusingly similar trademarks to ours from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from us,\ntarnish our reputation, or reduce the demand for our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets,\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, or diversion of management\nand technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our devices and our\nstreaming platform or could result in public disclosure of competitively sensitive trade secrets.\nWe incorporate open source software in our streaming platform. From time to time, companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source\nsoftware or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming\nownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Although\nwe have processes and procedures designed to help monitor our use of open source software, these processes and\nprocedures may not be followed by all of our employees or may fail to identify risks. Additionally, the terms of\nmany open source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses\ncould be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on the sale of our\ndevices or impose unanticipated obligations that require disclosure of trade secrets. In such event, we could be\nrequired to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost,\nto seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our devices, to re-engineer our devices, or to\ndiscontinue the sale of our devices in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all,\nany of which could harm our business.\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract\nmanufacturers, and suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to\ninfringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners, and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and Roku TV brand partners often\ninvolve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there\nis a claim of infringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to\nour technology. Liability under our indemnification commitments may not be contractually limited.\n37\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to pose risks to our business, the nature and extent of\nwhich are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting\neconomic consequences. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to take precautionary measures intended to help\nminimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including work from home policies, suspending certain business\ntravel, and limiting physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions as\nrequired by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, TV brand\npartners, content publishers, advertisers, retail and distribution partners, contract manufacturers, services\nvendors, and supply chain. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed\nby the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a mixed impact on our business in 2021. When staying-at-home restrictions\nwere first issued in the first quarter of 2020, we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours and account\nactivations, which have both since moderated as restrictions have lifted and we believe consumers have increasingly\npursued out-of-home entertainment activities. Although we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift\nof advertising from legacy TV to streaming TV, certain advertisers with businesses affected by the current global\nsupply chain disruptions have reduced and may continue to reduce their spending on advertising. We also have\nencountered supply chain disruptions related to our players that have resulted in an increase in component prices\nand elevated air freight costs to replenish inventory and meet increased demand, and some of our TV brand partners\nhave faced inventory challenges that have negatively impacted their unit sales, which we believe has affected and\ncould continue to affect our streaming hours and active account growth. Additionally, at times during the pandemic\nsome of our retail partners have had to close or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations,\nresulting in reduced sale of devices in these locations.\nWe continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our operational and\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including the timing,\nextent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic; the emergence infectiousness, and severity of new variants; the\ndevelopment, availability, distribution, acceptance, use, and effectiveness of vaccines, vaccine boosters, and\ntreatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures; the resolution of global supply chain disruptions;\nand the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on\nour business may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services,\nour supply chain and sales and distribution channels, our ability to execute our strategic plans, and our\nprofitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many\nof the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt and impact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including an earthquake, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber attack, war or foreign invasion (such as the potential\nRussian invasion of Ukraine), terrorist attack, medical epidemic or pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other\nman-made disasters, or other catastrophic events could disrupt our business operations. Any of these business\ndisruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. In\nparticular, our principal offices are located in California, and our contract manufacturers and some of our\nsuppliers are located in Asia, both of which are regions known for seismic activity, making our operations in these\nareas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas. Our insurance coverage may not\ncompensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. In\naddition, our offices and facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and TV brand partners,\ncould be vulnerable to the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and\nincreased storm severity) that could disrupt our business operations. For example, in California, increasing\nintensity of drought and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages.\nFurther, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole. If our streaming\nplatform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired. Disruptions in the operations of\nour contract manufacturers, suppliers, or TV brand partners as a result of a disaster or other catastrophic event\ncould delay the manufacture and shipment of our products or Roku TV models, which could impact our business. If we\nare unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a\ndisaster or other catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or\ncatastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\n38\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to or affected by general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to\nthe internet and online services, including laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, trade, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children, and accessibility,\namong others. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation\nand regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations\ngoverning issues such as data privacy and security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, liability of\nproviders of online services, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs, and consumer protection related to the\ninternet continue to develop. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising continue to evolve, increasing\nregulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing our Roku TV reference design, we were\nrequired to understand, address, and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and our TV brand partners may be unable to\nsell Roku TV models at all, which could harm our business and our ability to grow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, consumer\nprotection, and similar activities continue to proliferate, often with little harmonization between jurisdictions\nand limited guidance. A number of bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and other government bodies that contain\nprovisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to\ncollect, use, and share user information. The CCPA also imposes requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nhas laws requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for example, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from\nusers for the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. In\naddition, EU institutions continue to negotiate the draft of the proposed Digital Services Act, legislation\nintended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services. If we or the third\nparties that we work with, such as contract payment processing services, content publishers, vendors, or\ndevelopers, violate or are alleged to violate applicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our\ncontractual obligations, or our policies, such violations and alleged violations may also put our users’\ninformation at risk and could in turn harm our business and reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any\nof these consequences could cause our users, advertisers, or publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our\nbusiness. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to liability and\nreputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties. In addition, the FTC\nhas initiated a review of its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which\nlimits the collection by operators of online services of personal information from children under the age of 13.\nThe review could result in broadening the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information that are\nsubject to these regulations. Changes to the COPPA rules could limit the information that we or our content\npublishers and advertisers may collect and use and the content of advertisements in relation to certain channel\npartner content. The CCPA also imposes certain opt in and opt out requirements before certain information about\nminors can be collected. We and our content publishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged\nviolation of these and other privacy, advertising, or similar laws.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies, geopolitical conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the countries in which our contract manufacturers,\ncomponent suppliers, and other business partners are located. Our operations and performance depend significantly\non global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.\nFor example, tensions between the United States and China have led to the United States’ imposition of a series of\ntariffs, sanctions, and other restrictions on imports from China and sourcing from certain Chinese persons or\nentities, as well as other business restrictions. These and other trade disputes can disrupt supply chains and\nincrease the cost of our products and the components required to manufacture our products, as well as costs for our\nRoku TV brand partners. This\n39\ncould cause our products and those of our Roku TV brand partners to be more expensive for consumers, which could\nreduce the demand for or attractiveness of such products. Countries also could adopt other measures, such as\ncontrols on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our operations and\nsupply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of restrictions\ncould be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse\nimpacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have\na negative impact on consumer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. In\nparticular, given the general deterioration in U.S.-China relations and ongoing tensions on trade, security. and\nhuman rights, additional U.S. sanctions, tariffs. and export or import restrictions, as well as Chinese sanctions\nor retaliatory measures, remain a serious risk.\nWe cannot predict whether new international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing free trade agreements\nrenegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the Biden Administration with other U.S.\ntrading partners; or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry\nor our business or licensees. If any new legislation or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade\nagreements are renegotiated or terminated, or if tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be\ninefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes,\nand higher prices could depress consumer demand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain products,\ncommodities, software, and technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted\nlaws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or\nstrategic partners, or could limit the ability of our commercial or strategic partners to implement our products in\nthose countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in\nthe introduction of our products in international markets, disrupt supply chains, prevent our commercial or\nstrategic partners with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any changes in U.S.\nor foreign export or import regulations, customs duties, or other restrictions on intangible goods (such as cross-\nborder data flows) could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell\nour products and services to, existing or new customers in U.S. or international markets or hamper our ability to\nsource products, components, and parts from certain suppliers or lead to potential supply chain disruptions and\nbusiness or reputational harms. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import,\nor sell our products or services, or source parts or components, could harm our business. Although we attempt to\nensure that we, our retailers, and partners comply with the applicable import, export, and sanctions laws, we\ncannot guarantee full compliance by all. Actions of our retailers and partners are not within our complete control,\nand our devices could be re-exported to sanctioned persons or countries, or provided by our retailers to third\npersons in contravention of our requirements or instructions or the laws. Any such potential violation could have\nnegative consequences, including government investigations or penalties, and our reputation, brand, and revenue may\nbe harmed.\nFurther, there are many uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic, including scientific and health issues, the\npace of worldwide vaccinations, the unknown duration and extent of economic disruption, and the impact on the\neconomies of various countries in which we operate or in which our contract manufacturers and suppliers are\nlocated. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in further supply shortages of products for us or our TV\nbrand partners, delays in shipping and transportation services that negatively impact our ability or our TV brand\npartners’ ability to import, export, ship, or sell products to customers in U.S. and international markets, and our\nability to market and sell our streaming services internationally. Any limitations or delays on our or our TV brand\npartners’ ability to produce, import, export, ship, or sell our products would harm our business, and could\nnegatively impact our international sales.\nIn addition, the effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be\nfar-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic\nconditions. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people\nbetween the United Kingdom and the EU, and some disruptions have already occurred. Brexit could also lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate. Although the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on the EU-UK post-Brexit economic\nrelationship took effect on January 1, 2021, it is incomplete, and the full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given\nthese possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent\nto which our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is\nuncertain.\n40\nU.S. or international rules (or the absence of rules) that permit internet access network operators to degrade\nusers’ internet speeds or limit internet data consumption by users, including unreasonable discrimination in the\nprovision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Laws, regulations, or court\nrulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including decisions that undermine\nopen and neutrally administered internet access, or that disincentivize internet access network operators’\nwillingness to invest in upgrades and maintenance of their equipment, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us, or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations governing the provision of internet access service.\nSubstantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such provisions. For example, in 2015,\nthe FCC adopted open internet rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access to certain products and services offered by us and our content\npartners. In 2018, the FCC repealed most of those rules. More recently, the Biden Administration signed an\nexecutive order encouraging the FCC to readopt comprehensive open internet rules. The FCC therefore could consider\nadopting additional or modified rules to prevent internet access network operators from unreasonably restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for data and services. If network operators were to engage in restricting,\nblocking, degrading, or charging for access, it could impede our growth, result in a decline in our quality of\nservice, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise impair our ability to attract and retain users, any of\nwhich could harm our business. Several states and foreign countries in which we operate also have adopted or are\nconsidering rules governing the provision of internet access.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations (or their existing interpretations or\napplications) could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent, or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. We rely on the statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the\n“DMCA”) and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States, and the E-Commerce Directive in\nEurope, for protection against liability for various caching, hosting, and linking activities. The DMCA, Section\n230, and similar statutes and doctrines on which we rely or may rely in the future are subject to uncertain\njudicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Any legislation or court rulings that limit the\napplicability of these safe harbors could require us to take a different approach toward content moderation on our\nplatform, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content that we offer, inhibit our ability to\ngenerate advertising, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, if the rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply\nsimilar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could\nincur liabilities and our business could be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is streamed over or the advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may\nsuffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability\ncould harm our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may\nbe imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform. While our platform policies\nprohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the copyright holder, and we maintain\nprocesses and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in certain instances our platform has\nbeen misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted content. If content owners or\ndistributors are deterred from working with us as a consequence, it could impair our ability to maintain or expand\nour business, including through international expansion plans.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock may be\nadversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby\n41\nmanagement on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, The\nNasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and\nmanagement resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to\npredict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the payment of income taxes and the collection of\nindirect taxes, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties, and fees as a result of our\nnoncompliance, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements to deduct or withhold income taxes on revenue sourced in various jurisdictions, pay\nincome taxes on profits earned by any permanent establishment (or similar enterprise) of ours that carries on\nbusiness in various jurisdictions, and collect indirect taxes from our sales in various jurisdictions. The laws and\nregulations governing the withholding and payment of income taxes and the collection of indirect taxes are\nnumerous, complex, and vary by jurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were\nrequired to withhold or pay income taxes or collect indirect taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, fees, and expenses, including substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nWe earn a portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to tax laws in the United States\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or\ntheir interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are\ntaxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in\nwhat form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals under consideration, if enacted into law, could have\nan adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows.\nIn addition, both tax policy and tax administration are becoming multilateral. This multilateralism and\ncollaboration among taxing authorities (including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate) has\nresulted in proposed new tax measures specifically targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming services,\nand the remote sale of goods and services. Some of these measures (such as a global corporate minimum tax) require\nadoption of local legislation consistent with the agreed to multilateral framework. Other measures (such as digital\nservices taxes) have already been implemented but may terminate upon the adoption of multilateral tax rules.\nThe rapid growth of multilateralism in tax administration means greater sharing of tax information among taxing\nauthorities as well as the likelihood of joint and simultaneous tax audits of companies such as ours who have\ncross-border business activities in which the tax administrations may have a common or complementary interest. The\nresults of any such audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial results for the period\nor periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged\nin intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the\neconomics of these transactions and that the proper local transfer pricing is in place, tax authorities may propose\nand sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates.\n42\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other\npenalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation,\nand require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our stock\nprior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their\naffiliates, and limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31,\n2021, Mr. Wood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though\nhe only owns 12.0% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Wood owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Wood is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. This\nconcentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could\nresult in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated\ncontrol could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited\nvoting power relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our\nClass A common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nour loss of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our devices or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\n43\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial\nperformance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock, including short selling of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\ngeneral economic and market conditions; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or\npublic health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation or derivative litigation. For example, a stockholder has filed a derivative\nlawsuit, purportedly on our behalf, against certain members of our Board of Directors and management in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention\nfrom other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and stock options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\ndirectors, employees, and certain contingent workers are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second, and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These directors, employees, and contingent\nworkers may also sell shares during a closed window period pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it is\ndilutive to existing stockholders and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock. If securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our\nstock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If\none or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly,\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n44\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market regulations, may increase legal and financial compliance costs\nand make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail\nto comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against\nus, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of\nDirectors, on committees of our Board of Directors, or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to\nchange our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our Class\nA common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Roku, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\nA common stock.\n45\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. federal district courts\nwill be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nemployees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation, or our bylaws; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the U.S. federal\ndistrict courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by\na court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive\nforum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nfurther significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which\ncould harm our business.",

The terms of our Credit Agreement also restrict our ability to\npay dividends, and we may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will\nrestrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock.\nSale of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nStock Performance Graphs and Cumulative Total Return\nThe following graph shows the cumulative total stockholder return of an investment of $100 in cash from September\n29, 2017 (the date our Class A common stock commenced trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market) through December\n31, 2021, for (i) our Class A common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index, and (iii) the Peer Group of companies.\nBecause no published index of comparable player and platform companies is currently available, we have used the\nPeer Group of companies for the purposes of this graph in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The Peer\nGroup is made up of Alphabet, Inc., Logitech International S.A., Meta Platforms, Inc., Netflix, Inc., Snap, Inc.,\nTwitter, Inc., Yelp, Inc., and Zillow Group, Inc. Not all of the companies included in the Peer Group participate\nin all the lines of business in which we are engaged, and some of the companies are engaged in lines of business in\nwhich we do not participate. Additionally, the market capitalization of some of the companies included in the Peer\nGroup are different from ours.\nPursuant to applicable SEC rules, all values assume reinvestment of the full amount of all dividends, however no\ndividends have been declared on our Class A common stock or Class B common stock to date. The stockholder return\nshown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and we do not make or endorse any\npredictions as to future stockholder returns.\n47\nCompany / Index           Dec-17    Dec-18    Dec-19    Dec-20    Dec-21\nRoku, Inc.                  $370      $219      $956    $2,371    $1,630\nNasdaq Composite Index      $107      $104      $142      $206      $252\nPeer Group                  $107       $98      $134      $193      $270\nSource: Prepared by Zacks Investment Research, Inc.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween those years. Discussions of fiscal year 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and\n2019 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nOverview\nWe operate in two reportable segments: the platform segment and the player segment. Platform revenue is generated\nfrom the sale of digital advertising and related services including our OneView ad platform, content distribution\nservices (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the\nsale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls), and licensing\narrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer revenue is generated primarily from the sale of streaming players and audio products. We expect to continue\nto manage the average selling prices (“ASP”) of our streaming players to increase our active accounts. We expect\nthat the trade off from player gross profit or loss to grow active accounts will result in increased platform\nrevenue and platform gross profit.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe widespread global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2021. Governmental authorities have put\nin place various precautionary measures and promoted vaccination programs to slow down the spread of the virus. The\nimpact of the pandemic continues to vary by geography as well as over time as different variants of the virus\nsurface. The majority of our workforce continues to work from home to protect the health and safety of our\nemployees, and business travel continues to be curtailed. We evaluate and refine our return to office strategy by\ngeography as circumstances change. We expect that most employees will adopt a hybrid work schedule (consisting of\nboth in-person work and working from home) in 2022.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting precautionary measures, have caused, and are expected to continue to\ncause, economic uncertainty both in the United States and globally as well as significant volatility in, and\ndisruption to, financial markets and supply chains. Global supply chain disruptions have resulted in shipping\ndelays, increased shipping costs, component shortages, and increases in component prices. In addition, some of our\nTV brand partners have faced inventory challenges that have negatively impacted their unit sales.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift of TV viewing away from legacy TV to streaming TV. During the year\nended December 31, 2021, we continued to see an increase in the number of active accounts , but the growth rate was\nslower than in the prior year . Active accounts increased to 60.1 million as of December 31, 2021, growing 17%\nyear-over-year. Streaming hours for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 73.2 billion, growing 25% year-\nover-year.\nWe have largely been able to maintain an inventory of our players, audio products, and accessories in stock at\nretailers and online stores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, like many companies, we have been negatively\naffected by the constraints in the global supply chain, which have resulted in shortages of certain components,\nincreased component costs, shipping constraints, and increased shipping costs. Player unit sales were down in the\nsecond half of 2021, year-over-year, due to the demand spike in the second half of 2020 because of the COVID-19\npandemic. In 2021, we insulated our customers from the rising player-related costs and prioritized account\nacquisition growth, which strategically supports our Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) growth. The increasing\ncomponent costs put additional constraints on our player gross margin resulting in a gross loss in the player\nsegment for the year ended December 31, 2021. Though we do not believe that the cost constraints and supply chain\nissues are permanent, they may continue to impact us in the near future, and we expect player gross margin to be\nnegative until such conditions normalize.\n49\nOur platform segment continues to perform well, with platform revenue increasing to $2,284.9 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth of 80%. Our ARPU grew to $41.03, up 43% year-over-year.\nAlmost every major media company has reorganized around streaming and, as a result, our content distribution\nbusiness has benefited as our active accounts growth was accompanied by continued consumer demand for both ad-\nsupported and subscription services, and increased media and entertainment promotional spending by our content\npartners. We believe advertising budgets will continue to shift from legacy TV to streaming TV and that we will\nbenefit from this shift due to our advanced advertising capabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, however,\ncertain advertising verticals experienced supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted product availability\nand resulted in reduced advertising spend. While we have experienced an increase in TV streaming during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and our business generally has benefited, there can be no assurance that these patterns will\ncontinue into 2022.\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. Substantially all of our gross profit is generated from our\nplatform segment.\nOur gross profit was $1,408.6 million and $808.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, reflecting an increase of 74%.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the number of unique individuals who\nactively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an account. For example, a single account\nmay be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account may be used on multiple streaming\ndevices.\nWe had 60.1 million and 51.2 million active accounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively reflecting an\nincrease of 17%.\nHours Streamed\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed from The Roku Channel on non-Roku platforms are\nnot included in this metric. We report streaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, as well as revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue\nfrom content publishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming\nhours does not correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis.\nMoreover, streaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku player or a Roku TV is streaming content,\nwhether a viewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer\nturns off the TV, steps away, or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming\nchannel may continue to play content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this\nalso occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, all of our devices include a Roku OS feature that is designed to identify when\ncontent has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This\nfeature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are\nstill watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe\nthat the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our customers, channel partners, and\nadvertisers. Some of our leading channel\n50\npartners, including Netflix, also have implemented similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature\nsupplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our\nfuture financial performance.\nWe streamed 73.2 billion and 58.7 billion h ours during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively\nreflecting an increase of 25%.\nNote About Our Streaming Hours Adjustments\nTo calculate and report our streaming hours, we utilize data from event logs generated by the firmware running on\nthe Roku devices that are recorded in a central database. The event information (play, pause, stop, time counts,\netc.) is generated by the firmware running on the Roku streaming devices, and event data is transmitted to our\ncentral database at regular intervals when a device is connected to the internet. Pause time is not intended to be\nincluded in streaming hours.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020 we discovered that some pause time was inadvertently included in the streaming\nhours information recorded in our central database. Upon discovering these errors in the log data, we promptly\nreviewed and analyzed the issue utilizing our firmware, data engineering and core analytics teams. We concluded\nthat certain past Roku OS releases inadvertently caused the logging errors. The error rates varied over time and\nacross different types of devices and firmware versions. As a result, we reported higher streaming hours and\nstreaming hours growth rates for the affected periods than we would have if all pause time had been excluded from\nstreaming hours as we had intended. Neither these logging errors, nor the resulting adjustments that we made to our\nstreaming hours calculations, has had any impact on our financial results, and do not require us to revise any of\nour previously reported key operating metrics other than streaming hours.\nThe affected log data was for the periods from February 2016 to August 2020. After adjusting for logging errors, we\nestimate that our streaming hours were, on average, approximately 0.5% lower than previously reported for the\nperiod January 2017 through September 2018, and approximately 5.8% lower for the period October 2018 through March\n2020.\nBy the end of August 2020, we fully deployed a software update that addressed the root cause of the pause time\nlogging errors and prevented them from continuing.\nThe roll out of the “Are you still watching” feature had no impact on the adjustments we made to our streaming\nhours calculations. While our revenue from content publishers is not based on the hours streamed on their streaming\nchannels, and the number of streaming hours does not directly correlate to revenue earned from such content\npublishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis; we believe that the growth in the number of hours of content\nstreamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the growing user demand for TV streaming. After\nadjusting our streaming hours as discussed above, our estimated year-over-year streaming hour growth rates for\nfiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018, and the first quarter of 2020\nversus the first quarter of 2019 were 60.5%, 59.3%, and 46.8%, respectively. The estimated year-over-year streaming\nhour growth rate for the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019 was 65%.\nThe following table presents the estimated impacts on streaming hours (in billions) for periods from January 1,\n2017 through March 31, 2020 and streaming hours growth rates on a year-over-year (“YoY”) basis by quarter for\nperiods from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and annually for fiscal year 2018 and 2019. Revised streaming\nhours for 2016 are not estimated and therefore revised 2017 YoY growth rates are not available.\n51\nQuarter    Published SHs    Revised SHs    SHs % Delta    Published YoY    Revised YoY\n2017 Q1    3.3B             3.2B           (0.5)%         63.4%            NA\n2017 Q2    3.5B             3.5B           (0.4)%         60.0%            NA\n2017 Q3    3.8B             3.8B           (0.4)%         57.8%            NA\n2017 Q4    4.3B             4.3B           (0.2)%         55.3%            NA\n2018 Q1    5.1B             5.1B           (0.5)%         56.0%            56.1%\n2018 Q2    5.5B             5.4B           (0.5)%         57.2%            57.0%\n2018 Q3    6.2B             6.1B           (0.7)%         62.7%            62.1%\n2018 Q4    7.3B             7.1B           (2.2)%         68.6%            65.2%\n2019 Q1    8.9B             8.4B           (5.4)%         74.1%            65.5%\n2019 Q2    9.4B             8.8B           (6.0)%         72.1%            62.6%\n2019 Q3    10.3B            9.6B           (6.5)%         67.6%            57.9%\n2019 Q4    11.7B            10.9B          (6.3)%         60.2%            53.7%\n2020 Q1    13.2B            12.3B          (7.0)%         49.3%            46.8%\nYear       Published SHs    Revised SHs    SHs % Delta    Published YoY    Revised YoY\n2017       14.8B            14.8B          (0.4)%         58.8%            NA\n2018       24.0B            23.7B          (1.1)%         61.7%            60.5%\n2019       40.3B            37.8B          (6.1)%         67.8%            59.3%\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $41.03 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $28.76 as of December 31, 2020.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from digital advertising sales and related services including our OneView ad platform,\ncontent distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue sharing arrangements, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands. Our ad inventory includes video\nad inventory from AVOD content in The Roku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver, as well\nas ad inventory we obtain through our content distribution agreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-\nsell video inventory that we purchase from content publishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party\ninventory on a revenue share basis. To date, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nPlayer Revenue\nWe generate player revenue primarily from the sale of streaming players through consumer retail distribution\nchannels, including major brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart, and online retailers, including\nAmazon. We generate most of our player revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily\nsell our players through wholesale distributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers. We currently distribute our\nplayers in various countries in North America, South America, and Europe.\nPlayer revenue also includes the sale of our audio products, including wireless speakers, smart soundbars and\nwireless subwoofers.\n52\nCost of Platform Revenue\nCost of platform revenue primarily consists of costs associated with acquiring advertising inventory and\namortization costs of content, both licensed and produced. Cost of platform revenue also includes other costs such\nas payment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the delivery of our services that primarily include\ncosts of third-party cloud services and salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our platform\noperations personnel, and amortization of acquired developed technology.\nCost of Player Revenue\nCost of player revenue is comprised mostly of manufacturing costs for streaming players and audio products payable\nto our third-party contract manufacturers and technology licenses or royalty fees. Cost of player revenue also\nincludes inbound and outbound freight, duty and logistics costs, third-party packaging, inventory reserves, and\nallocated overhead costs related to facilities and customer support, and salaries, benefits, and stock-based\ncompensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and player\nproducts and services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions, and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management, and partner and customer\nsupport functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and\nallocated facilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars\nin future periods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and player revenue, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\nfinance, legal, information technology, human resources, and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting, and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the expansion of\nour business and related infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and\ncash equivalents, income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated with the delivery of services as\npart of a strategic commercial arrangement, i nter est expense that includes interest on our debt and amortization\nof deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement, and transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nOur income tax (benefit) expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have a valuation allowance for U.S. and\nNetherlands deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. U.S. deferred tax assets include tax\ncredits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the\nforeseeable future.\n53\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021       2020       2019\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   83  %      71  %      66  %\nPlayer                                                     17  %      29  %      34  %\nTotal net revenue                                         100  %     100  %     100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                   30  %      28  %      23  %\nPlayer                                                     19  %      27  %      33  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                      49  %      55  %      56  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                                                   53  %      43  %      43  %\nPlayer                                                     -2  %       2  %       1  %\nTotal gross profit                                         51  %      45  %      44  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                   17  %      20  %      24  %\nSales and marketing                                        16  %      17  %      16  %\nGeneral and administrative                                  9  %      10  %      10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                   42  %      47  %      50  %\nIncome (Loss) from Operations                               9  %      -2  %      -6  %\nOther Income (Expense), Net:\nInterest expense                                            —  %       —  %       —  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 —  %       —  %       1  %\nTotal other income (expense), net                           —  %       —  %       1  %\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes                           9  %      -2  %      -5  %\nIncome tax benefit                                          —  %       —  %       —  %\nNet Income (Loss)                                           9  %      -2  %      -5  %\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nNet Revenue\n(in thousands, except                   Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                                                2021            2020        Change $    Change %\nPlatform                             $                 2,284,925    $  1,267,744    $  1,017,181          80  %\nPlayer                                                   479,659         510,644         -30,985          -6  %\nTotal net revenue                    $                 2,764,584    $  1,778,388    $    986,196          55  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $1,017.2 million, or 80%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to higher content distribution services, including higher\nrevenue from media and entertainment promotional spending and Premium Subscriptions, we well as higher advertising\nrevenue which includes revenue from our OneView ad platform.\n54\nPlayer\nPlayer revenue decreased by $31.0 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in both the volume of streaming players sold and average\nselling prices, offset by a slight increase in revenue from the sale of audio products and accessories. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the volume of streaming players sold decreased by 4% and the average selling price of\nplayers decreased by 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the volume of players sold\nis due to the slowdown in growth in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2020 when the growth was aided by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the average selling price is due to higher\npromotions during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 where the volume\nwas aided by the COVID-19 pandemic and required fewer promotions.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of Revenue:                                             2021          2020       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                   823,924    $  503,177    $   320,747          64  %\nPlayer                                                    532,060       466,992         65,068          14  %\nTotal cost of revenue                 $                 1,355,984    $  970,169    $   385,815          40  %\nGross Profit (Loss):\nPlatform                              $                 1,461,001    $  764,567    $   696,434          91  %\nPlayer                                                    -52,401        43,652        -96,053        -220  %\nTotal gross profit                    $                 1,408,600    $  808,219    $   600,381          74  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of platform revenue increased by $320.7 million, or 64%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily driven by higher advertising inventory\ncosts, higher content amortization costs, Premium Subscription costs, and credit card processing fees totaling\n$303.1 million. Platform costs increased an additional $15.3 million due to increases in cloud services costs for\nsupporting the platform and higher personnel costs.\nGross profit for platform revenue increased by $696.4 million, or 91%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the overall growth in our platform revenue.\nPlayer\nThe cost of player revenue increased by $65.1 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher product costs of $35.6 million, an\nincrease in freight costs of $15.0 million, an increase in overhead costs such as cloud services, outsourced\nconsulting services, and personnel costs totaling to $9.4 million, higher royalty expenses of $5.7 million, and an\nincrease in inventory reserves of $2.8 million offset by a reduction in other manufacturing related costs of $3.3\nmillion.\nGross profit for player revenue decreased by $96.1 million, or 220%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a gross loss for fiscal year 2021. The increase in costs\nwas driven primarily by higher direct manufacturing costs for player products and accessories as a result of\ndisruptions in the global supply chain driving component prices higher, combined with reduced player revenue in\n2021 as compared to 2020. We believe that the cost increases and supply chain issues will continue in the near\nfuture, and we expect to incur negative gross margin in the player segment until such conditions normalize.\n55\nOperating Expenses\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021          2020       Change $    Change %\nResearch and development              $                   461,602    $  355,784    $   105,818          30  %\nSales and marketing                                       455,601       299,457        156,144          52  %\nGeneral and administrative                                256,297       173,231         83,066          48  %\nTotal operating expenses              $                 1,173,500    $  828,472    $   345,028          42  %\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $105.8 million, or 30%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $84.3 million, as a result of increased engineering headcount and related stock-based compensation, and higher\nconsulting, professional services, and cloud services costs of $17.4 million.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $156.1 million, or 52%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $91.4 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation in sales and sales support,\nproduct management, marketing, and business analytics to support efforts to grow our business. Sales and marketing\nexpenses also include an increase of $44.7 million mainly due to increases in advertising expenses to promote the\nRoku brand, marketing, retail and merchandising costs, and general sales promotions, an increase of $9.5 million in\nprofessional services and consulting fees, and an increase in facilities costs of $8.3 million due to expansion of\noffice spaces.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $83.1 million, or 48%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs\nof $50.0 million related to increased headcount and related stock-based compensation, an increase of $28.3 million\nrelated to higher legal expenses, consulting, and professional services fees, and a net increase of $4.8 million\nrelated to higher general overhead, business taxes, and similar costs offset by recoveries of credit losses.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021         2020       Change $    Change %\nInterest expense                      $                    -2,980    $  -3,432    $       452         -13  %\nOther income (expense), net                                 4,467        5,233           -766         -15  %\nTotal other income (expense), net     $                     1,487    $   1,801    $      -314         -17  %\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, decreased by $0.3 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses of $2.5\nmillion and lower interest income of $1.4 million from a decline in interest rates, which impacted our investment\nyields. This was offset by $3.1 million of other income recognized related to non-cash consideration associated\nwith the delivery of services for a strategic commercial arrangement and decreased interest expense of $0.5\nmillion.\n56\nIncome Tax Benefit\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2021       2020       Change $    Change %\nIncome tax benefit                    $                    -5,798    $  -945    $    -4,853         514  %\nIncome tax benefit\nIncome tax benefit increased by $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, driven primarily by stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, increased losses in a foreign\njurisdiction with no valuation allowance, and a tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,146.0 million. Less than 1% of our cash was held\noutside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries, which are used to fund foreign operations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and player revenue and proceeds from equity sales, including\nequity issued pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of revenue,\nincluding costs to acquire advertising inventory, costs to license and produce content, third-party manufacturing\ncosts, as well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting and professional service fees,\nand facility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment and mergers and\nacquisitions.\nAs our business and workforce continue to expand, we expect to continue to incur expenses for facility and building\nrelated costs for our office locations in the United States and internationally. In addition, we expect to continue\nour investments in purchases of computer systems and other property and equipment. We have pursued merger and\nacquisition activities, such as the acquisition of the Nielsen AVA business, the This Old House business, and\ncontent rights from Quibi, and we may pursue additional merger and acquisition activities in the future, including\nthe acquisition of rights to programming and content assets. These activities can materially impact our liquidity\nand capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balance, cash flow from operations, and our undrawn available\nbalance under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and\nmaterial cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. Our future\ncapital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be affected by various\nrisks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this\nAnnual Report and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has not severely impacted our liquidity\nand capital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital\nand credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Agreement expires in February 2023. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn March 2, 2021, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc., and Evercore Group L.L.C., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we could offer and sell from time-\nto-time shares of our Class A common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $1,000.0 million. In March 2021,\nwe sold approximately 2.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average selling price of $379.26 per share,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of $1,000.0 million and incurred issuance costs of $10.4 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (as amended on\nMay 3, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan\nA facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”), and (iii) an\nuncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the\nTerm Loan A Facility, collectively, the “Credit Facility”).\n57\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility mature or have to be repaid in full by February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are\nsecured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to\nmaintain a certain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default. As of December\n31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $38.0 million and $30.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2021          2020\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   228,081    $  148,192\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities    $                  -176,819    $  -81,324\nCash flows provided by financing           $                 1,003,147    $  509,048\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our net income of\n$242.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $355.7 million comprised\nmainly of stock-based compensation, amortization of content assets, depreciation and amortization on property and\nequipment and intangible assets, and amortization of operating right-of-use assets. The changes in our operating\nassets and liabilities used cash of $370.0 million mainly from an increase in accounts receivable primarily driven\nby an increase in revenue, an increase in content assets, an increase in contract assets from revenue recognized\nfrom customers, payments made for operating lease liabilities, and a decrease in deferred revenue offset by inflows\nfrom an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventory balances. These changes\nare mainly due to overall growth in the business combined with the timing of receipts from customers and payments\nto vendors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included cash outflows of $176.8 million comprised of\n$136.8 million for the acquisition of businesses, mainly the Nielsen AVA business and This Old House, and $40.0\nmillion for purchases of property and equipment and expenditures on leasehold improvements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $1,003.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash was\nreceived mainly from proceeds from an at-the-market offering of $989.6 million, net of issuance costs, and proceeds\nfrom the exercise of employee stock options of $18.5 million. These inflows were offset by $5.0 million of\nrepayments made on borrowings.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:\nPrincipal payments related to our Term Loan A Facility that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and\nthe related periodic interest payments. For additional information regarding the terms of the debt and interest\npayable, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to purchase finished goods from our contract manufacturers and other inventory related items.\nConsistent with industry practices, we enter into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with\nour contract manufacturers to acquire products through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Our contract manufacturers source components and build our\nproducts based on these demand forecasts. Changes to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our\nproducts may result in us being committed to purchase excess inventory to satisfy\n58\nthese commitments. For additional information regarding manufacturing purchase commitments, see Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCommitments to license content from content publishers under contractual arrangements. For additional information\nregarding licensed content commitments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report.\nOperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets and liabilities related to the\nlease arrangements that have not yet commenced. For additional information regarding our lease liabilities, see\nNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe contractual commitments discussed above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included above.\nIn addition, we have $ 66.2million of unrecognized income tax benefits, for which we are unable to reasonably\npredict the timing of settlement of liabilities. These income tax benefits are not recognized in our consolidated\nbalance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and\nassumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current\neconomic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing\nbasis.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations requires significant\njudgment.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that\nmay include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangements, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur player revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our player end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated players. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition\n59\nrates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected\nperiod over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances\nmay occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to\nconsideration transferred, and the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to\nthe extent we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets and liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount rate. We amortize purchased-intangible\nassets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We review purchased-intangible assets\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally\nestimated, or that the carrying amount of the asset group to which it relates may not be recoverable. If such facts\nand circumstances indicate an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group\nagainst their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over\nthe fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we\naccelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns and Sales Incentives\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances that include allowance for sales returns\nand sales incentives. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience,\npromotional programs, claims to date, and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and\nsales incentives. If our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the\nlosses or gains could be material.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset U.S. and Netherlands net deferred tax assets due to the\nuncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax\nassets. Our valuation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. and\nNetherlands net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. In order to assess the likelihood that we will\nrecover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income, we review the level of positive and\nnegative evidence of future taxable income which is a critical estimate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents, and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing\n60\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of\n100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of December 31,\n2021, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $90.0 million with an effective interest rate of 2.0%. If\nthe amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and interest rates\nincreased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively,\nby an additional $0.9 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and we have minimal foreign currency risk related to our\nrevenue. In addition, most of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar, resulting in minimal\nforeign currency risks. In the future, if our international revenue increases or more of our expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely be more\nsignificant. For any of the periods presented, we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts. However, in\nthe future, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\n61",

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,\n2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Variable Consideration Determination of Content Distribution Services and Branded Channel\nButtons – Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs part of the Company’s revenue recognition for its arrangements with content publishers, management is required\nto estimate variable consideration from transactional revenue sharing related to content distribution services and\nthe sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nVariable consideration related to content distribution services and sale of branded channel buttons on remote\ncontrols (“content publisher arrangements”) is included in the estimated transaction price based on the expected\nvalue for which a significant reversal of revenue is not expected to occur. For content distribution services, the\nestimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted\nperformance of the publisher’s content applications. For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls,\nthe estimate of the variable consideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and\nforecasted player sales volumes.\n63\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration and transaction prices. Such estimates\nrequired a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content distribution\nservices and sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\nObtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\nAnalyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\nrecognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract, including\nterms and conditions for transactional revenue sharing.\nPerformed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance, operations, and sales departments\nregarding the estimates for content distribution services and sales of branded channel buttons on remote controls.\nTested management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to actual\nconsideration received.\nEvaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\nTested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecasts.\nWe considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communication to management,\nCompany press releases, industry reports, publicly available information related to publishers’ content\napplications as well as our observations and inquires as to the changes within the business.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n64\nROKU, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except

accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nROKU, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On February 1, 2008, Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company operates\nin tworeportable segments and generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services\nincluding the OneView ad platform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue\nshares, media and entertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded\nchannel buttons on remote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands and player\nrevenue from the sale of streaming players and audio products.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior period amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and notes to consolidated financial statements have\nbeen reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue, and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include:\nrevenue recognition: determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, determining the stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue\nrecognition, and evaluation of customer versus vendor relationships;\nthe impairment of intangible assets;\nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\nuseful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for sales returns and sales incentives; and\nthe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes foreign currency translation adjustments.\nComprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. Comprehensive loss for the year\nended December 31, 2019 includes unrealized gains on the Company’s short-term investments and foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments. Income taxes on the unrealized gains are not material.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for most of its foreign subsidiaries. Monetary assets\nand liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in effect\nat period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenue and expenses are\nremeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or losses from re-\nmeasurement and transaction gains or losses are recorded as Other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ 1.2million, gain of $ 1.3million, and\nloss of $ 0.2million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n71\nFor those foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is designated as the functional currency, the Company\nrecords translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation\nadjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at\nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Twofinancial institutions managed 30% and 27% of cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2021 and 46% and 26% as of December 31, 2020.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives, doubtful accounts, and other\nmiscellaneous allowances. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to determine allowances\nfor potential credit losses and doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional\nactivities, historical claim rates, and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns : Allowance for sales returns consist of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nBeginning balance                    $                     5,912    $    6,550    $    7,335\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                   16,181        14,594        15,541\nLess: Utilization of sales return                        -16,078       -15,232       -16,326\nreserve\nEnding balance                       $                     6,015    $    5,912    $    6,550\nAllowance for Sales Incentives : Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nBeginning balance                       $                    30,838    $   19,476    $   13,750\nAdd: Charged to revenue                                      90,530        68,315        65,676\nLess: Utilization of sales incentive                        -72,957       -56,953       -59,950\nreserve\nEnding balance                          $                    48,411    $   30,838    $   19,476\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts : Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021         2020        2019\nBeginning balance                         $                     4,181    $   1,140    $    686\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                                   —        1,066           —\nAdjusted beginning balance                $                     4,181    $   2,206    $    686\nProvision for (recoveries of) doubtful                           -904        3,801         704\naccounts\nAdjustments for recovery and write-off                         -1,119       -1,826        -250\nEnding balance                            $                     2,158    $   4,181    $  1,140\nThe Company did not have any customer that accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net balance as\nof December 31, 2021. Customer H accounted for 11% of the accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2020.\n72\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired businesses are\nincluded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is recognized\nat fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments\nto consideration transferred, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in\nconnection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and\nreevaluates these estimates and assumptions and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates with\na corresponding offset to goodwill during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or\nfinal determination of the values of consideration transferred, and assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is, more likely than not,\nless than its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit’s\ncarrying amount over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes\nin business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be fully\nrecoverable or that the useful lives of the asset or asset group are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese asset or asset groups for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying\nvalue of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an\nimpairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did notrecognize any impairment for goodwill or intangible assets in any periods reported. The\nimpairments of operating right-of-use assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were not\nmaterial.\nContent Assets\nThe Company records content assets as Other non-current assets. The amortization expense for licensed content is\nrecorded based on the pattern of monetization of such content which is primarily straight-line. The amortization of\nproduced content is recorded over the applicable content life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenue\nto the estimated total revenue to be earned.\nLicensed and produced content assets are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The\nfilm group is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change, indicating the fair value\nis less\n73\nthan the carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether the film\ngroup is impaired. The Company did notrecognize any impairment of content assets in any periods reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenue on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, the Company\nconsiders if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as\nwell as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The as-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the\nOneView ad platform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nThe Company sells digital advertising to advertisers directly or through advertising agencies and to content\npublishers for their media and entertainment promotions via various campaign tools. Advertising arrangements\ninclude video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions. Advertising arrangements include\nmultiple performance obligations as they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements,\nthe Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also\ngenerates revenue from customers using its ad platform. For such arrangements, it charges a platform fee, which is\na percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory spend during the month, along with data and any add-on features\npurchased through the platform. The Company recognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital\nadvertising based on its determination as to whether it is acting as the principal in the revenue generation\nprocess or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal, it controls the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to its customers. This is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers\nfor the fulfillment and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Advertising arrangements comprised of\nmultiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of\nthe distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\n74\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such Premium Subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nper subscriber or fixed percentage of revenue share to the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based\non the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in Cost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to TV brands and service operators. The licensing\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property available and the\ncontrol transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades and updates is recognized on a\ntime elapsed basis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are\nprovided or accepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nPlayer segment:\nThe Company sells the majority of its streaming players and audio products to retail distribution channels in the\nU.S. including brick and mortar and online retailers, as well as through the Company’s website. Player revenue\nprimarily consists of hardware, embedded software, and unspecified upgrades and updates on a when and if-available\nbasis. The hardware and embedded software are considered as one performance obligation and revenue is recognized at\na point in time when the control transfers to the customer. Unspecified upgrades and updates are available to\ncustomers on a when-and-if available basis. The Company records the allocated value of the unspecified upgrades and\nupdates as deferred revenue and recognizes it as player revenue ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated\neconomic life of the associated players products.\nThe Company’s player revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in Player revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue,\nplayer.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The\nCompany takes into consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental\nborrowing rate. The Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term,\nwhen it is reasonably certain to exercise one of the options. The Company combines lease and non-lease components\ninto a single lease component for its real estate and equipment leases.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\n75\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between eighteen monthsand five years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from fiveto ten years.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the\nCompany capitalized internal-use software development costs of $ 0.5million, $ 2.2million, and $ 0.1million,\nrespectively. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the\nasset, which is generally twoto three years, beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company amortized expenses of $ 1.0million, $ 0.5million, and $\n1.6million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received in advance that will be recognized as revenue over time or as\nservices are rendered. Deferred revenue balances consist of the amount of player revenue allocated to unspecified\nupgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis, licensing and services fees received from service operators\nand TV brands, and advance payments from advertisers and content publishers where performance obligations are not\nyet fulfilled. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as a current liability and\nthe remaining is recorded as a non-current liability.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company incurred advertising costs of $ 35.2million, $ 7.1million, and $ 7.3million\nfor the years December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model used to fair value stock options include the following assumptions:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock . The Company uses the closing market price of its Class A common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock\noptions are expected to remain outstanding. The Company uses the simplified calculation of the expected term, which\nreflects weighted-average time to vest and the contractual life of the stock options granted, in absence of its own\nhistorical exercise data.\nVolatility. The expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatilities of several peer\ncompanies which are similar in size and operational and economic activities.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities\nsimilar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\nDividend Yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no\ncurrent plans to pay any dividends on its common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using\n76\nenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation\nallowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than\nnot to be realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income\nTaxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes\nby removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also simplifies areas such as franchise taxes, step-up\nin tax basis of goodwill, separate entity financial statements, and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or\nrate changes. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic\n848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This guidance provides optional\nexpedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other\ntransactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) that is expected to be discontinued,\nsubject to meeting certain criteria. The guidance is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The\nCompany made a policy election in the second quarter of 2020 to elect a different reference rate for the Credit\nAgreement (as defined below) when LIBOR is discontinued.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective adoption method and\nrecorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit of approximately $\n1.1million. The measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and subsequent changes in the\nallowance for credit losses are recorded in the statements of operations. This impact mainly relates to credit\nlosses recognized on the Company’s doubtful accounts. As the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt\nsecurities as of the adoption date, there was no additional impact to accumulated deficit.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02, Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film Costs\n(Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350): Improvements to\nAccounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials , in order to align the accounting for\nproduction costs of an episodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the\ncontent distinction for capitalization. ASU 2019-02 required that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film\nin a film group and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 required that an entity test\nfilms and license agreements for program material for impairment at a film group level when the film or license\nagreements are predominantly monetized with other films and license agreements. There was no material impact to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , to require companies to apply Accounting Standards\nCodification, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years,\nwith early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The\nCompany believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n77\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is represented by the tworeportable segments discussed in Note 17.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             752,393    $  523,852    $  332,673\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                    46,952         7,431         3,588\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       45,760        55,465        39,861\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   28,726        21,283        15,370\nTotal deferred revenue                   $              74,486    $   76,748    $   55,231\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for sales returns, sales incentives,\nand doubtful accounts. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are current in nature and are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract assets increased by $ 39.5million during the year\nended December 31, 2021 and by $ 3.8million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which falls into a subsequent period.\nDeferred revenue reflects consideration invoiced prior to the completion of performance obligations and revenue\nrecognition. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ 2.3million during the year ended December 31, 2021\nprimarily due to the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations related to content arrangements offset by an\nincrease in deferred revenue from advertising arrangements due to growth in the platform business and an increase\nin the deferral period of player revenue for its unspecified upgrades. Deferred revenue increased by approximately\n$ 21.5million during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the increase in estimated values of content publisher\nand licensing partner arrangements and change in the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations of\napproximately $ 12.4million, and higher growth in the player segment, resulting in a net increase in deferred\nrevenue related to unspecified upgrades and updates of approximately $ 8.4million.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 from amounts included in the total deferred revenue as\nof December 31, 2020 was $ 56.2million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 from amounts\nincluded in the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $ 42.9million.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents estimated contracted revenue that has not yet\nbeen recognized which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in\nfuture periods. Estimated contracted revenue was $ 1,148.3million as of December 31, 2021 of which the Company\nexpects to recognize approximately 43% over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nThe Company recognized $ 28.6million and $ 14.4million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in the\nestimated transaction price of its revenue contracts .\nThe Company did not have any customer that accounted for more than 10% of its total net revenue as of December 31,\n2021. Customer C accounted for 12% and 14% of the total net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\n4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nNielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising Business\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “ASPA”) to purchase the\nAdvanced Video Advertising (“AVA”) business from Nielsen Holdings PLC (“Nielsen”). The AVA business consists\nprimarily of video automatic content recognition and dynamic ad insertion technologies. On April 15, 2021, the\nCompany closed the transaction, acquiring from Nielsen the AVA business, consisting of certain assets and\nliabilities and all of the\n78\nequity interests in a subsidiary associated with the AVA business (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the\nAcquisition, the Company and Nielsen entered into a strategic commercial arrangement under which the parties will\nprovide certain advertising measurement solutions to each other. The Company acquired Nielsen’s AVA business to\naccelerate its launch of an end-to-end linear ad replacement solution and to further integrate Nielsen’s ad and\ncontent measurement products into the Company’s ad platform.\nThe total purchase consideration for Nielsen’s AVA business was $ 53.4million, which consisted of (i) $ 38.5million\npaid in cash and (ii) $ 21.4million of non-cash consideration related to obligations to deliver services to\nNielsen, offset by (iii) $ 6.5million of services to be received from Nielsen. The obligations to deliver services\nto Nielsen were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. The services to be delivered to\nNielsen are recognized within Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period. The services to be received from Nielsen represent contract terms that the Company entered into\nfor future goods and services that were recorded at fair value using the incremental cash flow method. These\nservices are recognized as Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations over the six\nyearservice period.\nIn addition, there are earn-out conditions in the ASPA which may trigger an additional payment to Nielsen. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, no contingent consideration conditions have been triggered. The Company incurred $ 3.9million in\nacquisition-related expenses and has recorded them in General and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company obtained additional information regarding facts and circumstances in\nexistence as of the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 consisting of a $ 6.0million increase to purchase consideration, $ 4.2million decrease to\nintangible assets acquired, $ 4.5million increase to other long-term liabilities, and $ 14.7million increase to\ngoodwill.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nreflecting measurement period adjustments through December 31, 2021, is based on estimated fair values and is as\nfollows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $        3,057\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                       85\nProperty and equipment, net                                    584\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technology                                        11,000\nIPR&D technology                                             7,500\nGoodwill                                                    36,790\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          1,235\nOther non-current assets                                     1,905\nTotal assets acquired                                       62,156\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -1,168\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion              -830\nOther long-term liabilities                                 -6,767\nTotal liabilities assumed                                   -8,765\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       53,391\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is\nrecorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in advertising offerings and cross-\nselling opportunities. The majority of the goodwill recorded is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the developed technology has been estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key\nvaluation assumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future earnings and royalty rate. The Company\namortizes the fair value of the developed technology on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The fair value\nof the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) technology has been estimated using the multi-period-excess-\nearnings\n79\nmethod. The key valuation assumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and margin. Once\nthe project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will amortize the fair value of the IPR&D technology on\na straight-line basis over its useful life.\nThe valuation of the intangible assets acquired from Nielsen’s AVA business along with their estimated useful\nlives, is as follows (in thousands, except years):\nEstimated Weighted-Average Useful Lives\nEstimated Fair Value    (in years)\nDeveloped technology                $                11,000                                             5.9\nIPR&D technology                                      7,500\nEstimated fair value of acquired    $                18,500                                             5.9\nintangible assets\nThe operations of Nielsen’s AVA business are included in the Company’s operating results beginning on the date of\nacquisition. The revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit recorded by the Company in its consolidated statements\nof operations from the acquisition date to December 31, 2021 are not material.\nThis Old House\nOn March 19, 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of TOH Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“This Old\nHouse”), a home improvement media business, according to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nThe Company acquired the This Old House business because the Company believes the content aligns with The Roku\nChannel’s ad-supported growth strategy.\nThe total purchase consideration for This Old House was $ 97.8million, paid entirely in cash. The Company incurred\n$ 2.4million in acquisition-related expenses that are recorded in General and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n80\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nreflecting measurement period adjustments through December 31, 2021, is based on estimated fair values and is as\nfollows (in thousands):\nAssets acquired                                        Fair Values\nCash and cash equivalents                           $            7\nAccounts receivable                                          5,830\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                    7,310\nProperty and equipment, net                                    307\nIntangible assets:\nTradename                                                   20,000\nCustomer relationships                                         700\nGoodwill                                                    46,671\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                          5,498\nOther non-current assets                                    23,487\nTotal assets acquired                                      109,810\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities                    -2,747\nDeferred revenue, current portion                           -4,146\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current portion            -4,262\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                         -816\nOther long-term liabilities                                    -28\nTotal liabilities assumed                                  -11,999\nTotal purchase consideration                        $       97,811\nOther non-current assets include $ 22.5million of content assets acquired. The fair value of the content assets has\nbeen estimated using the income approach. Amortization expense related to the content assets is recorded on an\naccelerated basis according to the pattern of monetization.\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in the advertising\nofferings as the Company brings more free ad-supported content to the users. The goodwill recorded is deductible\nfor tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the tradename has been estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. The key valuation\nassumptions include the Company’s estimates of expected future revenue and royalty rate.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and utilizes a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used\nto measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents including restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $\n1,015.9million and $ 71.8million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, using Level 1\ninputs.\nLevel 2 —Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n85\nLevel 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe Company did not have any Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, and content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when\nimpairment is recognized.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office real estate.

As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2021, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a\nfull valuation allowance against its U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal and state valuation allowance increased by $ 261.8million and $ 169.7million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to U.S. federal and state tax losses and\ncredits incurred during the period.\nThe change in the valuation allowance, during the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in domestic net operating loss carryforwards, primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, and an\nincrease of approximately $ 46.2million in deferred tax assets that are not realizable, related to the IP transfer\ncompleted during 2021, giving rise to foreign amortizable assets.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2,169.9million and $ 1,824.3million are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in 2021.\nThe federal net operating loss generated subsequent to 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely.\nFor Brazil, Denmark, Netherlands, and U.K. income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.8million, $ 2.8million, $ 6.1million, and $ 33.9million, respectively, are available to reduce future taxable\nincome, if any, in those countries. Brazil, Denmark, and U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward\nindefinitely. Netherlands net operating losses can be carried back one year and carried forward indefinitely. The\nCompany also has U.K. research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 0.5million, which can be carried\nforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ 133.8million and $\n97.4million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2035, respectively.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains provisions that may limit the net operating\nloss and credit carryforwards available for use in any given period upon the occurrence of certain events,\nincluding a statutorily defined significant change in ownership. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of\nthe Code. The Company completed a recent study to assess whether any section 382 ownership change has occurred\nsince the Company’s\n94\nformation. Based on the study, the Company had a section 382 ownership change on December 18, 2009 and tax\nattributes generated by the Company through the ownership change date are subject to the limitation.\nA section 382 study was completed for dataxu, which the Company acquired in November 2019, covering the period from\ninception beginning May 1, 2008 through the acquisition date of November 8, 2019. Based on the study, the Company\nidentified fourownership changes for section 382 purposes. As such, tax attributes generated by dataxu through the\nownership change dates are subject to the limitation.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 is $ 66.2million, of which $ 48.7million is\ncomposed of research and development credits and $ 17.5million is related to international activities. A\nreconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021         2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              29,175    $  19,487\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                        36,198        9,959\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statute expiration                     -330          -75\nGross increase (decrease) for tax                           1,107         -196\npositions of prior years\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              66,150    $  29,175\nof year\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.4million of accrued interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions.\nChange in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would have an immaterial impact on its effective tax\nrate. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12\nmonths.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company\nis currently under examination by the Texas Comptroller for calendar tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. All tax years\nremain subject to examination by federal and state authorities. These audits include questioning the timing and\namount of deductions; the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; and compliance with federal, state, and\nlocal tax laws.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company did not engage in any material related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company engaged in transactions with one of its strategic investors. With\nrespect to this investor, the Company recorded revenue of $ 8.5million and expenses of $ 1.3million for the year\nended December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not consider this\ninvestor to be a related party, as this investor did not meet the defined criteria.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had engaged in transactions with another company in which the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer held a majority voting interest and was a member of such company’s board of\ndirectors at that time, and another member of the Company’s Board of Directors is presently such company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer. With respect to transactions with this company, the Company incurred expenses of $ 1.2million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019.\n15. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain\n95\nlimitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nNocontributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nIn 2014, the Company established a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company\ncontributed $ 1.3million, $ 0.7million, and $ 0.5million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020,\nand 2019, respectively.\n16. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company uses the two-class method to\ncalculate net income (loss) per share. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion, and transfer rights and\nas otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by\napplicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic\nand diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes.\nFor purposes of the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share, options to purchase common stock,\nrestricted stock units, and unvested shares of common stock issued upon the early exercise of stock options are\nconsidered common stock equivalents. Dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the treasury stock\nmethod. The dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in the period of net\nloss, as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as follows (in\nthousands, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                          2021                   2020                   2019\nNet income (loss)            $                   242,385             $  -17,507             $  -59,937\nDenominator:\nBasic net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    132,710                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — basic\nNet income (loss) per        $                      1.83             $    -0.14             $    -0.52\nshare — basic\nDiluted net income (loss)\nper share:\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    132,710                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — basic\nEffect of potentially\ndilutive\nsecurities:\nRestricted stock units                                      2,744                      —                      —\nStock options                                               6,214                      —                      —\nWeighted-average common\nshares                                                    141,668                123,978                115,218\noutstanding — diluted\nNet income (loss) per        $                      1.71             $    -0.14             $    -0.52\nshare — diluted\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because of their\nanti-dilutive effect are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021           2020            2019\nEquity awards to purchase common stock                                1,128          13,088          15,668\nUnvested shares of common stock issued\nupon early exercise of stock options and                                  —               1              31\nbusiness acquisition\nTotal                                                                 1,128          13,089          15,699\n96\n17. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level. The Company does not\nallocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable segments.\nThe Company is organized into tworeportable segments as follows:\nPlatform\nConsists of revenue generated from the sale of digital advertising and related services including the demand-side\nplatform, content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, media and\nentertainment promotional spending, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls), and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of streaming players, audio products and accessories through retailers and\ndistributors, as well as directly to customers through the Company’s website.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021       2020       2019\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                        10  %      13  %          *\nPlayer segment revenue\nCustomer A                                            *      10  %      16  %\nCustomer B                                        23  %      18  %      17  %\nCustomer C                                        37  %      40  %      39  %\n* Less than 10%\nRevenue in international markets was less than 10% in each of the periods presented.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Annual\nReport. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as\nof the end of the\n97\nperiod covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation,\neffective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Our assessment excluded internal controls over financial reporting of\nThis Old House and Nielsen AVA businesses which were acquired during the year and whose total assets represent 1.7%\nand total revenue represent 0.7% of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\n31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”, management excluded from its\nassessment the internal control over financial reporting at the This Old House and Nielsen AVA businesses which\nwere acquired during the year and whose financial statements constitute 1.7% of total assets and 0.7% of total\nrevenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAccordingly, our audit did not include the assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the This\nOld House and Nielsen AVA businesses.\n98\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 18, 2022",
