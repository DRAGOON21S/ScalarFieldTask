          "content": "PART I\nItem 1: Business\nOverview\nRoku, Inc. (“Roku”, “the Company”, “we” or “us”) is the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours\nstreamed.\nWe pioneered streaming to the TV and were founded on the belief that all TV content will be streamed. The re-\nplatforming of the TV ecosystem is underway and is creating more options for consumers, content publishers,\nadvertisers and other industry participants. TV streaming is now mainstream and consumers are spending more time\nwatching TV streaming services, with many ‘cutting the cord’ from legacy pay TV services entirely. Over the past\nseveral years, many of the biggest names in media have transitioned toward streaming offerings and similarly,\nadvertisers looking to reach and engage with streaming audiences are increasingly taking advantage of the benefits\ninherent to the digital advertising capabilities of TV streaming platforms and are re-allocating their budgets\naccordingly. These trends continued to gain momentum in 2020 as consumers spent more time at home due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nOur Strategy\nOur mission is to be the streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem of viewers, content publishers\nand advertisers. Through our TV streaming platform, we are focused on connecting consumers to the entertainment\nthey love, enabling content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and providing advertisers with unique\ncapabilities to engage consumers. Central to our platform is the Roku operating system (the “Roku OS”). The Roku OS\nis purpose built for TV and designed to run on low-cost hardware which allows us to manufacture and sell streaming\nplayers that are affordable. The Roku OS also powers Roku TV models that are manufactured and sold by our TV brand\npartners who license the Roku OS and leverage our smart TV hardware reference designs. Roku TV models and Roku\nstreaming players enable consumers to access a wide selection of content by connecting their Roku device to our\nstreaming platform via a home broadband network.\nThe features and functionality of our platform, powered by the Roku OS, enable us to address the needs of our\nconsumers, content publishers, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners, and other partners. Consumers can discover and\naccess a wide variety of streaming content, content publishers can reach our highly-engaged user base of over 50\nmillion active accounts and utilize our billing services and data insight tools, advertisers can serve targeted and\nmeasurable ads to the TV viewers that they want to reach, Roku TV brand partners can build market share by offering\nhigh performance smart TVs in a range of sizes and price points, and retailers can offer customers Roku’s highly-\nrated streaming devices on-line and in stores. We continue to invest significant resources to advance the Roku OS;\nto provide an industry-leading platform for our consumers, content publishers, and advertisers; and to extend\nRoku’s advantage as the streaming decade continues.\nOur Business Model\nThree core areas of focus define our business model. First, we build scale by increasing our active accounts.\nSecond, we increase engagement by growing the hours of content streamed through our platform. And third, we\nmonetize the activities that consumers engage in through our platform. Furthermore, our business model is designed\nto fulfill the needs of the participants in the TV streaming ecosystem: consumers, content publishers, advertisers,\nTV OEMs, other device licensees and consumer electronics retailers.\nScale: Increasing the number of active accounts\nWe make TV streaming affordable by offering a lineup of stand-alone streaming players that connect to a user’s TV.\nFurthermore, to enhance our users’ experience and to provide a better audio experience we also offer our Roku Smart\nSoundbars and Roku Streambars, each with a streaming player built in that enables the soundbar to connect to our\nstreaming platform, Roku wireless speakers that connect to Roku TV models, and our Roku Wireless Subwoofers. We\nlaunch new devices and provide updates via the Roku OS periodically to ensure they offer the highest performance at\nan affordable price.\n5\nWe also partner with TV brands that manufacture and sell co-branded Roku TV models that integrate the Roku OS to\nenable basic TV functions and connect to our TV streaming platform. We have driven strong growth in our Roku TV\nlicensing program. Using our reference designs results in relatively low hardware costs, enabling these TV brand\nlicensees to manufacture and sell smart TVs that are competitively priced for consumers and that are automatically\nupdated whenever we issue a Roku OS update.\nWe also license the Roku OS and our streaming player designs, as well as provide ongoing technology and support\nservices, to certain international pay TV and telco service operators that distribute co-branded players to their\nsubscribers in their markets.\nTaken together, we offer consumers tremendous optionality and value when it comes to gaining access to the Roku\nplatform, and combined with the exceptional user experience. We have been able to significantly scale our active\naccount base over a multi-year period. In 2020, we added over 14 million active accounts, ending the year with 51.2\nmillion active accounts.\nEngagement: Growing streaming hours\nWe believe that offering users a wide range of content drives increased user engagement by delivering a better\noverall streaming experience. Streaming hours on our platform have grown from 37.8 billion hours in 2019 to 58.7\nbillion hours in 2020, as we have grown active accounts through the distribution of Roku streaming players and Roku\nTV models, and as our active accounts stream more hours per day, on average.\nThrough our streaming platform and our streaming devices, we make it easy and affordable for our users to watch\ntheir favorite TV shows and movies, as well as listen to streaming audio. Furthermore, we believe our platform\noffers users an incredible streaming experience through a user interface that is easy to use and navigate. From the\nRoku home screen, our users can easily find and access the 500,000+ free and paid movies and TV episodes including\nlive TV, news, sports, hit movies, popular shows, and more that are available from the thousands of channels on our\nstreaming platform. And Roku’s powerful cross-channel search capabilities make it simple for our users to find the\nentertainment they’re looking for. Users have the optionality to align their spend to their budget by choosing\ncontent that is available on an ad-supported, subscription, or transactional basis. Our direct relationship with\nour users provides us with detailed insights about our users and their behavior on our platform, including certain\ncontent they search for, the channels they install, the channels they watch, and certain content that they purchase\nor subscribe to on our platform. Our first party data enables us to develop actionable insights such as content\nrecommendations to improve our users’ experience.\nWe enable our content partners to publish streaming channels, quickly and easily, which makes us an attractive\nplatform for content publishers to partner with as they seek to reach TV streaming, or over-the-top (“OTT”), users.\nContent publishers can deliver content directly to our large and relevant audiences and reach those users who no\nlonger use or those who never used legacy pay TV or paid TV subscriptions. As consumers shift to TV streaming,\ncontent publishers that use our platform are able to reach these streaming audiences at scale and engage users\ndirectly.\nThe Roku Channel is our own streaming channel that drives user engagement on our platform by providing our users\nfree, ad-supported access to a large library of third-party content that we directly license, in addition to\ncontent made available through The Roku Channel by our content publishers. In this way, The Roku Channel also is\nintended to help content publishers drive additional viewership and maximize the value of their content on our\nplatform. The Roku Channel is available in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. In 2020, in the U.S., we added a line-up of\nmore than 100 free live/linear channels on the Roku Channel and introduced a new Live TV Channel Guide, offering\nusers a convenient way to discover and watch live TV.\nMonetization: Growing our revenue and gross profit by monetizing user activity\nWe believe that running relevant display and digital ads enhances the user experience on our platform. We generate\nrevenue by monetizing our users’ engagement on our platform through a variety of services and capabilities,\nincluding video advertising in ad supported channels, sales of subscription services and other commerce\ntransactions, brand sponsorship and promotions, and billing services. Each individual user on our platform creates\nmultiple revenue opportunities for Roku, whether they’re purchasing content, enjoying ad-supported content or\nsimply opening the Roku home page. We measure monetization of our platform by calculating the average revenue per\nuser (“ARPU”), which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model, and growth in gross profit. In\n2020, ARPU (which we measure\n6\non a trailing twelve-month basis) increased from $23.14 to $28.76 and gross profit for the full year grew from\n$495.2 million to $808.2 million.\nOur sophisticated and leading streaming platform enables advertisers, including content publishers, brands and\nagencies, to reach audiences that are no longer reachable or are increasingly unavailable through advertising on\ntraditional TV. We make it easy for content publishers to distribute and monetize their streaming content through\nthree primary business models: transaction video on demand (“TVOD”), subscription video on demand (“SVOD”), and\nadvertising-supported video on demand (“AVOD”). Through our platform we are also able to assist content partners\nwith billing services, including billing customers for in-channel purchases like a movie rental, managing\nsubscriptions and customer invoices. Roku Pay, our platform billing solution, is a key platform capability that\nsimplifies consumer subscription signups and drives purchase and retention for partners.\nContent publishers also have access to our promotional and audience development tools to help them attract and\nretain viewers. Content publishers can use a variety of ad placements, including native display ads on the Roku\nhome screen or a screen saver to drive channel downloads, promote a channel’s content, and direct traffic to their\nchannels in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also sell branded channel buttons on\nstreaming player and Roku TV remote controls that are intended to increase incremental usage of the channel by\nallowing users to launch straight into the channel from the home screen. Our analytics and reporting assist content\npublishers with analyzing viewership trends and metrics for specific titles. Using machine learning, we also can\nhelp content publishers target new audiences that are more likely to subscribe to their services.\nThe Roku Channel provides monetization for both our content partners and Roku through digital advertising. The Roku\nChannel provides our users with free access to over 50,000 titles, including hit Hollywood movies, TV episodes,\nnews channels, and more and is a leading sources of advertising inventory. Through Premium Subscriptions within The\nRoku Channel, we resell ad-free premium content subscription services from providers such as Showtime, Starz, and\nEpix directly to our users. In addition, we have developed and implemented various features within The Roku Channel\nthat can be used to recruit and retain subscribers for Premium Subscription. For example, we provide personalized\ncontent selection for users and integrated The Roku Channel into our billing services to enable one-click\nsubscriptions.\nAdvertisers are able to use our platform to leverage our direct relationship with our users, as well as our\nadvertising capabilities and user data and insights, to serve relevant, targeted advertisements. Advertisers on our\nplatform also can measure both the effectiveness of the ads served and their return on investment. We offer\nengagement analytics such as ad impressions served, click-through rates, and video completion rates. We work with a\nwide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads served and audience\ndemographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on our platform. Furthermore, we\nhave relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data, which enables our\nadvertisers to compare the effectiveness of ads served on our platform to advertising on traditional TV. Additional\npromotional advertising opportunities include content sponsorships to give users the opportunity to experience a\nfree movie or show and sponsored themes on our home screen. We also sell branded content rows within The Roku\nChannel.\nIn May 2020, we announced the rebranding of the OneView Ad Platform, a single platform leveraging TV identity data\nto manage advertising across OTT, desktop, and mobile campaigns. As consumers move to TV streaming, OneView\nprovides advertisers with a toolset to scale their OTT advertising and marketers self-serve capabilities to\noptimize and measure effectiveness across screens. OneView integrates the reach, inventory, and capabilities of\nRoku advertising with the identity and attribution tools of demand-side platform dataxu, which the company acquired\nin November 2019.\nInternational Markets\nWe believe that the value our business delivers to participants in the TV ecosystem in the U.S. — consumers,\ncontent publishers, advertisers, TV OEMs, other device licensees, and retailers — is also compelling in\ninternational markets. To date, we have brought the same business model to certain markets that has enabled us to\ndevelop the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours streamed. In 2020, Roku TV was the No. 1 selling smart\nTV operating system in Canada. Also, in 2020, we launched in Brazil, first in partnership with AOC to bring the AOC\nRoku TV to consumers and then with the launch of Roku Express, our first streaming device in the country. In these\nnewer markets, we will continue to focus on building scale, increasing engagement, and ultimately driving\nmonetization.\n7\nSales and Marketing\nWe engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities to continuously drive scale, engagement, and\nmonetization and dedicate significant resources to this area. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily\nfocused on building and expanding relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, retailers and\nservice operators, and driving sales of our streaming players and audio products and Roku TV models to consumers\nthrough retail distribution channels.\nWe have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships, to promote and build\nawareness of the features and advantages of the Roku platform among content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform\nto increase effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing\ncampaigns. We enter into distribution agreements with our content publishers and license their content through our\ndedicated content relationship management team. Our relationship with content publishers is typically client-\ndirect. We secure direct access to publishers’ video ad inventory as part of our distribution agreements and serve\nas an additional channel for content publishers to monetize their audience. These sales efforts are differentiated\nand complementary to that of our content publishers. Whereas our publishers typically sell on a cross-platform\nbasis and feature their brand and content in their sale, we focus on delivering a large OTT audience across many\nchannels at once. We sell advertising to a wide range of advertisers helping them reach their goals across numerous\nkey performance indicators. Our sales teams and products are organized into six groups that specialize in the\nunique needs of each area: (i) agency holding companies and Fortune 500 brands, (ii) independent agency and mid-\nmarket clients, (iii) content publishers and entertainment brands, (iv) performance and direct to consumer brands,\n(v) international markets and (vi) local advertising.\nWe work with our Roku TV brand partners to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TV models, including\ndevelopment, planning, manufacturing and marketing. Similarly, we work with service operators on the planning and\ndevelopment of their co-branded players.\nIn the United States, the majority of our streaming players, audio products and Roku TV models are sold through\ntraditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart, including their online sales\nplatforms, and online retailers such as Amazon, and to a lesser extent our website. We also sell products\ninternationally through distributors and to retailers. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nsales through Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our player segment revenue. These\nthree retailers collectively accounted for 69% and 72% of our player segment revenue for the years ended December\n31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and work closely\nwith these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting. We intend to continue to invest\nsignificant resources in our sales and marketing efforts.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business related to advertising and streaming player sales. Our\nrevenue and gross profit are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high\npercentage of the total net revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising\nduring holiday seasons. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our player sales through retailers in the fourth\nquarter of the fiscal year are pursuant to committed sales agreements with retailers for which we recognize\nsignificant discounts in the average selling prices in the third quarter in an effort to grow our active accounts,\nwhich will reduce our player gross margin.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development model relies on a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and\nmanufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, audio\nproducts, TVs, features and functionality. We work closely with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands, and\nservice operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development process that\ncaptures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features\nand enhancements to the Roku platform.\n8\nWe intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and\nenhance our platform and capabilities.\nManufacturing\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to our contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. All\nof our products are manufactured by our contract manufacturers in the People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asia\nand Brazil. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific\nprice. Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecast we establish\nbased upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions. The contract\nmanufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in California, the United Kingdom and Brazil where\nthey ship players directly to retailers, wholesale distributors and to end users.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business and our devices and platform are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations\ncovering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business regulations and\nlaws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of Internet-delivered streaming services and Internet-\nconnected devices. New laws and regulations in these areas may have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of\ncompliance with these laws and regulations are substantial and are likely to increase in the future. Compliance\nwith existing or future laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to internet and\nonline services, data privacy and security, consumer protection, global trade, employee health and safety, and\ntaxes, could have an adverse impact on our business in subsequent periods. If we fail to comply with these laws and\nregulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nIn particular, our business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations applicable to companies\nconducting business using the Internet. Both domestic and foreign jurisdictions vary widely as to how, or whether,\nexisting laws governing areas such as privacy and data security, online platform liability, consumer protection,\npayment processing or sales and other taxes and intellectual property apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and\nthese laws are continually evolving. Moreover, the laws governing these areas, as well as those governing\nelectronic contracts and Internet content and access restrictions, among other areas, are rapidly evolving. The\nlaws in these areas are unsettled and future developments are unpredictable. Laws that lead to more stringent\nregulation of companies engaging in businesses using the Internet may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn the United States, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues is rapidly evolving. State and\nfederal consumer protection regulators generally exercise oversight of consumer privacy protections and the\nsecurity of online services. For example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018\n(“CCPA”), which gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal\ninformation, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their\npersonal information is used. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy\nlegislation. State laws may also impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent\ndisclosure of personal information. Foreign jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer\nand privacy protections, including the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR\nbroadly regulates the processing of personal information about individuals in the EU and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance. Such consumer privacy laws are constantly changing and may become more diverse and\nrestrictive over time, challenging our ability to fully comply with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws\nalso may limit the ability of advertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our\nbusiness.\nTax regulations in domestic and international jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes\nmay subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, to additional taxes or to requirements intended\nto assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws\nfrom jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and\nregulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose\nnew tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and\nservices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online\nmarketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result\n9\nin liability for third-party obligations. For example, Maryland recently passed legislation establishing a tax on\ncertain advertising activities and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, including member states\nof the EU have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of\noperations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us\nprospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any\ncollection obligations. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and\nregulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies, and any such developments could harm\nour business.\nIn addition, the Internet is a vital component of our business and also is subject to a variety of laws and\nregulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. We expect to rely on the historical openness and accessibility\nof the Internet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede or fail to preserve the open\nInternet could harm our business. To the extent regulatory agencies adopt rules that allow network operators to\nrestrict the flow of content over the Internet, such operators may seek to extract fees from us or our content\npublishers to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory practices\nwith respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur content publishers also are subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction.\nBecause our business depends on the availability of third-party content delivered over the Internet, increased\nregulation of our content publishers or changes in laws or regulations governing Internet retransmission of third-\nparty content could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish\nand protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and\ninvention assignment agreements and other contractual rights.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 195 issued patents and 200 pending applications in the United States\nand foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our product\nofferings or business.\nCompetition\nThe TV streaming industry is highly competitive and, as it continues to evolve, we will continue to face aggressive\ncompetition in every aspect of our business. We compete with much larger companies which have resources and brand\nrecognition that pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, we believe our success\ndepends on our ability to acquire users by delivering high quality streaming devices at competitive prices,\npartnering with Roku TV brands to bring co-branded smart TVs to market, and developing and monetizing our streaming\nplatform with compelling content, promotional services and advertising.\nOur competitors include:\nlegacy pay TV service operators;\ncompanies that offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players and Roku TV models and\ncompanies that license their operating systems for integration into smart TVs and other streaming products;\nTV brands that offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs and well as other devices like game\nconsoles, DVD players, Blu-ray players and set-top boxes that leverage their own operating systems;\nmobile streaming platforms, that enable users to stream content on phones and tablets;\ncompanies that offer advertisers the opportunity to reach consumers on other content and advertising\nmediums; and\ncompanies that operate in the same locations as our offices that may be better able attract and retain top\ntalent in engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations and other organizations.\n10\nAs the TV streaming market continues to develop, we may become subject to additional competition as we introduce or\ndevelop newproducts and services, as our existing products and services evolve, or as other companies introduce\ncompeting products and services.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S. by hours streamed, we believe our success depends on our culture\nand our ability to attract and retain our employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,925 full-\ntime employees located in nine countries. Only our employees in Brazil are represented by a labor union with\nrespect to their employment. The majority of our employees currently are working remotely as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nCulture\nWe want our employees to be proud to work at Roku. Our entrepreneurial, execution focused culture focuses on\nrecruiting talented individuals, encouraging teamwork and expecting our employees to perform at a high level.\nAcross Roku, teams are expected to communicate clearly, in real time. Because our employees are trusted and\nencouraged to make decisions, leadership communicates plans, milestones and strategic context broadly, and\nemployees are trusted to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Our employees are encouraged to use our\nbroad talent base for diverse points of view when making decisions.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nRoku is committed to being a diverse and inclusive organization. We follow through on this commitment through our\nannual pay equity analysis designed to ensure we pay fairly and equitably across gender and ethnicity, year over\nyear; our hiring and management trainings that incorporate topics on mitigating unconscious bias; and by having\ndiverse interviews panel that limit questions to those that are legally compliant and objectively tied to\napplicable job openings.\nDuring 2020, we furthered our commitment to diversity and inclusion by promoting a new Vice President of Inclusion\nStrategy and Talent Development who is building a growing team that is focusing on priorities in four key areas:\nInclusive Employee Experiences, Inclusive Recruiting, Inclusive Communities & Social Impact, and Inclusive Customer\nAdvocacy.\nInclusive Employee Experiences: Among other initiatives, we have launched an Employee Resource Group (ERG) Program\nand are currently developing seven ERGs. We also launched a series of educational employee-led dialogues that cover\nvarious topics of diversity ranging from ethnic diversity to neurodiversity and are providing diversity and\ninclusion training and curriculum in the areas of bias, leading diverse teams, and sourcing diverse talent.\nInclusive Recruiting:Every member of our recruiting team is trained on how to source, engage, and recruit qualified\ndiverse candidates. In fact, all recruiters are equipped to discuss a diverse hiring strategy with every hiring\nmanager to ensure we continue to widen the candidate pipeline for all roles. Our University Recruiting and Intern\nprograms weave diversity and inclusion into their strategies so that we are recruiting not only from diverse\nschools but also diverse clubs and programs across all schools. Our external relationships also are focused on\norganizations that represent diverse communities, including technical and non-technical women and ethnic minority\norganizations, as well as professional Veteran’s networks, to enable our hiring managers and recruiters to attend\nor speak at diverse conferences, share our job descriptions, and tell our employer brand story to a wider audience.\nInclusive Communities & Social Impact:We are in the process of developing new social impact programs to support\nemployees and Roku in volunteerism, charitable activities, and youth engagement and anticipate we will have more to\nshare related to our commitment to leaving a positive impact on young people and our wider community in future\nperiods.\nInclusive Customer Advocacy:As a TV streaming platform for viewers in the U.S. and certain international locations,\nwe want to reflect our users in our overall user experience and accessibility, content we license, and the channel\non our platform. During 2020, we launched a policy designed to acknowledge key areas of diversity and identity\nthoughtfully, meaningfully, and inclusive of our diverse customer base, year-round.\nTraining & Employee Development\nOur Learning and Development function provides our employees with the training and development needed to support\nour growth. Our employee training programs begin with a comprehensive New Hire Orientation that covers our\n11\nculture and business. Our Orientation is supplemented by checklists and resources for an employee’s first 90 days.\nIn addition to mandatory training covering Anti-Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, and Privacy trainings, we offer\nemployees a highly encouraged suite of training offerings such as Effective Feedback, Effective Meetings, and\nCommunication and Presentation Skills. Managers also are provided an additional set of trainings on Expectations\nfor Managers, Interviewing and Hiring, and Performance Management to support new and newly promoted leaders in how\nto manage and lead effectively. Our employees also have free access to additional training in technical and non-\ntechnical subjects through LinkedIn Learning. We intend to continue to review, refresh, purchase and/or custom\nbuild additional training materials to support the performance and development needs of our global employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented professionals. As a result, we\nendeavor to pay competitive total compensation that is guided by market rates and tailored to account for the\nspecific needs and responsibilities of a particular position as well as the unique qualifications of the individual\nemployee. In determining each employee’s total compensation, we consider what they would be paid by another\nemployer, what we would have to pay to replace them it they leave Roku, and the amount we would pay to retain them.\nWe pay employees total compensation that is comprised of salary and equity awards rather than offer specific\nbenefits or perks that might be valued differently by different employees. We do not pay cash bonuses or have\nperformance-based equity awards because our employees are expected to work at the highest level regardless of\npossible bonus payouts or awards.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.roku.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed\nor furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as\nsoon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).

competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, content owners and\naggregators, TV brands and service operators, are actively focusing on this industry. If we fail to differentiate\nourselves and compete successfully with these companies, it will be difficult for us to attract and retain users\nand our business will be harmed.\nTV streaming is highly competitive and global. Our success depends in part on attracting and retaining users on,\nand effective monetization of, our streaming platform. To attract and retain users, we need to be able to respond\nefficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our users access to the content they love on\nterms that they accept. Effective monetization requires us to continue to update the features and functionality of\nour streaming platform for users, content publishers and advertisers. We also must effectively support popular\nsources of streaming content that are available on our platform, such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+,\nHBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Netflix and YouTube. And we must respond rapidly to actual and anticipated market trends in\nthe TV streaming industry.\nCompanies such as Amazon, Apple and Google offer TV streaming devices that compete with our streaming players. In\naddition, Google licenses its Android operating system software for integration into smart TVs and service provider\nset-top boxes, and Amazon licenses its operating system software for integration into smart TVs. These companies\nhave greater financial resources than we do and can subsidize the cost of their streaming devices in order to\npromote their other products and services, which could make it harder for us to acquire new users, retain existing\nusers and increase streaming hours. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not\ncompatible with our products or that provide a better streaming experience. These companies also promote their\nbrands through traditional forms of advertising, such as TV commercials, as well as digital advertising or website\nproduct placement, and have greater resources to devote to such efforts than we do.\nIn addition, many TV brands offer their own TV streaming solutions within their TVs. Other devices, such as game\nconsoles and many DVD and Blu-ray players, also incorporate TV streaming functionality. Similarly, some service\noperators offer TV streaming applications as part of their cable service plans and can leverage their existing\nconsumer bases, installation networks, broadband delivery networks and name recognition to gain traction in the TV\nstreaming market. If consumers of TV streaming content prefer alternative products to our streaming players and our\npartners' Roku TV models, we may not be able to achieve our expected growth in active accounts, streaming hours,\nrevenue, gross profit or ARPU.\nWe expect competition in TV streaming from the large technology companies and service operators described above, as\nwell as new and growing companies, to increase in the future. This increased competition could result in pricing\npressure, lower revenue and gross profit or the failure of our players, Roku TV models or our platform to gain or\nmaintain broad market acceptance. To remain competitive and maintain our position as a leading TV streaming\nplatform we need to continuously invest in our platform, product development, marketing, service and support and\ndevice distribution infrastructure. In addition, evolving TV standards such as 8K, HDR and unknown future\ndevelopments may require further investments in the development of our players, Roku TV models, and our platform.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments needed to maintain our competitive\nposition. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger\ncustomer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than us, which\nprovide them with advantages in developing, marketing or servicing new products and offerings. As a result, they\nmay be able to respond more quickly to market demand, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sales\nand distribution of their products or their content, and influence market acceptance of their products better than\nwe can. These competitors may also be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards and\nmay be able to deliver products and services at a lower cost. Increased competition could reduce our sales volume,\nrevenue and operating margins, increase our operating costs, harm our competitive position and otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nIn July 2018, we introduced our Roku TV Wireless Speakers, designed specifically for use with Roku TV models, in\nSeptember 2019, we launched our Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer and in September 2020, we launched\nour Roku Streambar. As a result of these developments, we may face additional competition from makers of TV audio\nspeakers and soundbars, as well as makers of other TV peripheral devices. While our audio products have not\ngenerated material amounts of revenue, if these products do not operate as designed or do not enhance the Roku TV\nor other viewing experience as we intend, our users’ overall viewing experience may be diminished, and this may\nimpact the overall demand for Roku TV models or our other products.\n15\nWe also compete for video viewing hours with mobile platforms (phones and tablets), and users may prefer to view\nstreaming content on such devices. Increased use of mobile or other platforms for TV streaming could adversely\nimpact the growth of our streaming hours, harm our competitive position and otherwise harm our business.\nOur future growth depends on the acceptance and growth of OTT advertising and OTT advertising platforms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive advertising industry and we compete for revenue from advertising with other\nstreaming platforms and services, as well as traditional media, such as radio, broadcast, cable and satellite TV,\nand satellite and internet radio. These competitors offer content and other advertising mediums that may be more\nattractive to advertisers than our streaming platform. These competitors are often very large and have more\nadvertising experience and financial resources than we do, which may adversely affect our ability to compete for\nadvertisers and may result in lower revenue and gross profit from advertising. If we are unable to increase our\nrevenue from advertising by, among other things, continuing to improve our platform’s capabilities to further\noptimize and measure advertisers’ campaigns, increase our advertising inventory and expand our advertising sales\nteam and programmatic capabilities, our business and our growth prospects may be harmed. We may not be able to\ncompete effectively or adapt to any such changes or trends, which would harm our ability to grow our advertising\nrevenue and harm our business.\nMany advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising,\nsuch as linear TV, radio and print. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of OTT advertising, and\non advertisers increasing their spend on advertising on our platform. Although traditional TV advertisers showed\ngrowing interest in OTT advertising during 2020, we cannot be certain that their interest will continue to increase\nor that they will not revert to traditional TV advertising, especially if our users no longer stream TV or\nsignificantly reduce the amount of TV they stream either as a result of lifting of stay-at-home orders, the end of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons. If advertisers, or their agency relationships, do not perceive\nmeaningful benefits of OTT advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely\nimpact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our streaming platform, which may harm our business.\nOur business model depends on our ability to generate platform revenue from advertisers and content publishers. We\ngenerate platform revenue primarily from advertising and audience development campaigns that run across our\nstreaming platform and from content distribution services. As such, we are seeking to expand the number of active\naccounts and increase the number of hours that are streamed across our platform in an effort to create additional\nplatform revenue opportunities. As our user base grows and as we increase the amount of content offered and\nstreamed across our platform, we must effectively monetize our expanding user base and streaming activity. The\ntotal number of streaming hours, however, does not correlate with platform revenue on a period-by-period basis,\nprimarily because we do not monetize every hour streamed on our platform. Moreover, streaming hours on our platform\nare measured whenever a player or a Roku TV is streaming content, whether a viewer is actively watching or not. For\nexample, if a player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off the TV, steps away or falls asleep and does not\nstop or pause the player then the particular streaming channel may continue to play content for a period of time\ndetermined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also occurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming\ndevices and other set-top boxes. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the first quarter of 2020, we\nupdated the Roku OS with a feature that is designed to identify when content has been continuously streaming on a\nchannel for an extended period of time without user interaction. This feature,which we refer to as “Are you still\nwatching,” periodically prompts the user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes\nthe channel if the user does not respond affirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across\nthe Roku platform benefits us, our customers, channel partners and advertisers. Some of our leading channel\npartners, including Netflix, also have similar features within their channels. This Roku OS feature supplements\nthese channel features. This feature has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial\nperformance.\nOur ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our users and to increase our platform’s value to\nadvertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or\nprevented by a number of factors. Users may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect personal viewing\ndata or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. Content publishers may also refuse to allow us to\ncollect data regarding user engagement or refuse to implement mechanisms we request to ensure compliance with our\nlegal obligations or technical requirements. For example, we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing\ndata from many of our most popular channels to improve the relevancy of advertisements provided to our users. Other\nchannels available on our platform, such\n16\nas Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu and YouTube, are focused on increasing user engagement and time spent within\ntheir channel by allowing users to purchase additional content and streaming services within their channels. In\naddition, we do not currently monetize content provided on non-certified channels, which are not displayed in our\nchannel store and must be added manually by the user, on our streaming platform. If our users spend most of their\ntime within particular channels where we have limited or no ability to place advertisements or leverage user\ninformation, or users opt out from our ability to collect data for use in providing more relevant advertisements,\nwe may not be able to achieve our expected growth in platform revenue or gross profit. If we are unable to further\nmonetize our streaming platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to materially increase the monetization of our streaming platform through the sale of video advertising,\nwe will need our users to stream significantly more ad-supported content. Our efforts to monetize our streaming\nplatform through ad-supported content are still developing and may not continue to grow as we expect. Further,\nwhile we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in our revenue from advertising, our\nefforts to monetize our streaming platform through the distribution of AVOD content are still developing and our\nadvertising revenue may not grow as we expect. This means of monetization will require us to continue to attract\nadvertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver AVOD content that appeals to users. Accordingly,\nthere can be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution\nof ad-supported content.\nIf we are unable to attract advertisers or advertising agencies to our OneView Ad Platform or if we are not\nsuccessful in running a demand-side advertising platform, our business may be harmed.\nIn 2020, we announced the rebranding of the OneView Ad Platform, a demand-side platform through which advertisers\nand advertising agencies can programmatically purchase and manage their OTT, desktop and mobile advertising\ncampaigns. OneView leverages the DSP developed by dataxu, which we acquired in November 2019, and integrates the\nreach, inventory and capabilities of our proprietary advertising products and services. The market for programmatic\nOTT ad buying is an emerging market, and our current and potential advertisers and advertising agencies may not\nshift to programmatic ad buying from other buying methods as quickly as we expect or at all. If the market for\nprogrammatic OTT ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, advertisers and advertising\nagencies may not use OneView or we may not attract prospective advertisers or advertising agencies to OneView, and\nour business could be harmed. In addition, we have limited experience running a DSP and if OneView does not have\nthe functionality or services expected by advertisers or advertising agencies, we may not be able to attract their\nadvertising spend to OneView or our existing customers may not maintain or increase their spend on OneView. If we\nfail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to our customers evolving needs, advertisers and advertising\nagencies will not adopt OneView and our business may be harmed. We also may not be able to compete effectively with\nmore established DSPs or be able to adapt to changes or trends in programmatic OTT advertising, which would harm\nour ability to grow our advertising revenue and harm our business.\nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to develop and expand our relationships with TV brand partners in the\nUnited States and international markets and, to a lesser extent, service operators.\nWe have developed, and intend to continue to develop and expand, relationships with TV brand partners and, to a\nlesser extent, service operators in both the United States and international markets. Our licensing arrangements\nare complex and time-consuming to negotiate and complete. Our current and potential partners include TV brands,\ncable and satellite companies and telecommunication providers. We continue to invest in the growth and expansion of\nour Roku TV program both in the United States and International markets. Our licensing program for service\noperators has historically been primarily focused on international markets and has not been growing in scale in\nrecent years, as we have shifted the focus of our international growth to the sale of Roku streaming players and\nRoku TV models.\nIn the past few years, the sale of Roku TV models by our TV brand partners has materially contributed to our active\naccount growth, to our streaming hours, and to our platform monetization efforts. This growth has primarily been in\nthe United States; however, our Roku TV licensing program has been expanded to certain international markets. We\nlicense the Roku OS and our smart TV reference designs to certain TV brand partners to manufacture co-branded smart\nTVs. We have not received, nor do we expect to receive, license revenue from these arrangements, but we expect to\nincur expenses in connection with these commercial agreements. The primary economic benefits that we derive from\nthese license arrangements have been and will likely continue to be indirect, primarily from growing our active\naccounts, increasing streaming hours and generating advertising-related revenues on our platform. If these\narrangements do not continue to\n17\nresult in increased active accounts and streaming hours, and if that growth does not in turn lead to successfully\nmonetizing that increased user activity, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of a relationship with a TV brand or service operator could harm our results of operations, damage our\nreputation, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other partners and distribution channels, or increase\nour marketing costs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships with any of\nthese third parties, or if we encounter technological, content licensing or other impediments to our development of\nthese relationships, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nUnder these license arrangements, we generally have limited control over the amount and timing of resources these\nentities dedicate to the relationship. If our TV brand or service operator partners fail to meet their forecasts\nfor distributing licensed streaming devices, or chose to deploy competing streaming solutions within their product\nlines, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of content publishers for a majority of our streaming hours, and if we fail to maintain\nthese relationships, our business could be harmed.\nHistorically, a small number of content publishers have accounted for a significant portion of the hours streamed\non our platform. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the top three streaming services represented over 50% of all\nhours streamed in the period. If, for any reason, we cease distributing channels that have historically streamed a\nlarge percentage of the aggregate streaming hours on our platform, our streaming hours, active accounts or\nstreaming device sales may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nIf popular or new content publishers do not publish content on our platform, we may fail to retain existing users\nand attract new users.\nWe must continuously maintain existing relationships and identify and establish new relationships with content\npublishers to provide popular streaming channels and popular content. In order to remain competitive, we must\nconsistently meet user demand for popular streaming channels and content; particularly as we launch new players,\nnew Roku TV models are introduced, or we enter new markets, including international markets. If we are not\nsuccessful in helping our content publishers launch and maintain streaming channels that attract and retain a\nsignificant number of users on our streaming platform or if we are not able to do so in a cost-effective manner,\nour business will be harmed. Our ability to successfully help content publishers maintain and expand their channel\nofferings on a cost-effective basis largely depends on our ability to:\neffectively promote and market new and existing streaming channels;\nminimize launch delays of new and updated streaming channels; and\nminimize streaming platform downtime and other technical difficulties.\nIn addition, if service operators, including pay TV providers, refuse to grant our users access to stream certain\nchannels or only make content available on devices they prefer, our ability to offer a broad selection of popular\nstreaming channels or content may be limited. If we fail to help our content publishers maintain and expand their\naudiences on the Roku platform or their channels are not available on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nMost of our agreements with content publishers are not long term and can be terminated by the content publishers\nunder certain circumstances. Any disruption in the renewal of such agreements may result in the removal of certain\nchannels from our streaming platform and may harm our active account growth and engagement.\nWe enter into agreements with all our content publishers, which have varying terms and conditions, including\nexpiration dates. Our agreements with content publishers generally have terms of one to three years and can be\nterminated before the end of the term by the content publisher under certain circumstances, such as if we\nmaterially breach the agreement, become insolvent, enter bankruptcy, commit fraud or fail to adhere to the content\npublishers’ security or other platform certification requirements. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are\nrequired to re-negotiate and renew them in order to continue providing content from these content publishers on our\nstreaming platform. We have in the past been unable, and in the future may not be able, to reach a satisfactory\nagreement with certain content publishers before our existing agreements have expired. If we are unable to renew\nsuch agreements on a timely basis on mutually agreeable terms, we may be required to temporarily or permanently\nremove certain channels from our streaming platform. The loss of such channels from our streaming platform for any\nperiod of time may harm our business. More broadly, if we fail to\n18\nmaintain our relationships with the content publishers on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if these content\npublishers face problems in delivering their content across our platform, we may lose channel partners or users and\nour business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of quality video ad inventory on our platform or effectively sell\nour available video ad inventory, our business may be harmed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to grow video ad inventory on our streaming platform and sell it to\nadvertisers. While The Roku Channel serves as a valuable source of video ad inventory for us to sell, we are also\ndependent on our ability to monetize video ad inventory within other ad-supported channels on our streaming\nplatform. We seek to obtain the ability to sell such inventory from the content publishers of such channels. We may\nfail to attract content publishers that generate a sufficient quantity or quality of ad-supported content hours on\nour streaming platform, or fail to obtain access to a sufficient quantity and quality of ad inventory from the\npublishers of such content. Our access to video ad inventory in ad-supported streaming channels on our platform\nvaries greatly among channels; accordingly, we do not have access to all of the video ad inventory on our platform.\nFor certain channels, including YouTube’s ad supported channel, we have no access to video ad inventory at this\ntime, and we may not secure access in the future. The amount, quality and cost of video ad inventory available to\nus can change at any time. If we are unable to grow and maintain a sufficient supply of quality video ad inventory\nat reasonable costs to keep up with demand, our business may be harmed.\nIf our content publishers do not participate in new features that we may introduce from time to time, our business\nmay be harmed.\nAs our streaming platform and products evolve, we will continue to introduce new features, which may or may not be\nattractive to our content publishers or meet their requirements. For example, some content publishers have elected\nnot to participate in our cross-channel search feature, our integrated advertising framework, or have imposed\nlimits on our data gathering for usage within their channels. In addition, our streaming platform utilizes our\nproprietary Brightscript scripting language in order to allow our content publishers to develop and create channels\non our streaming platform. If we introduce new features or utilize a new scripting language in the future, such a\nchange may not comply with our content publishers' certification requirements. In addition, our content publishers\nmay find other languages, such as HTML5, more attractive to develop for and shift their resources to developing\ntheir channels on other platforms. If content publishers do not find our streaming platform simple and attractive\nto develop channels for, do not value and participate in all of the features and functionality that our streaming\nplatform offers, or determine that our software developer kit or new features of our platform do not meet their\ncertification requirements, our business may be harmed.\nIf the advertising and audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising on our platform are not\nrelevant or not engaging to our users, our growth in active accounts and streaming hours may be adversely impacted.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable advertisers and content publishers to deliver\nrelevant advertisement, audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising to our users. Existing and\nprospective advertisers and content publishers may not be successful in serving ads and audience development\ncampaigns and sponsoring other promotional advertising that lead to and maintain user engagement. Those ads and\ncampaigns may seem irrelevant, repetitive or overly targeted and intrusive. We are continuously seeking to balance\nthe objectives of our advertisers and content publishers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, but\nwe may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users, advertisers and content\npublishers. If we do not introduce relevant advertisers, audience development campaigns and other promotional\nadverting or such advertisements, audience development campaigns and other promotional advertising are overly\nintrusive and impede the use of our streaming platform, our users may stop using our platform which will harm our\nbusiness.\nThe Roku Channel may not continue to attract a large number of users and/or generate significant revenue from\nadvertising, and our users may not purchase Premium Subscriptions.\nWe operate The Roku Channel, which offers both ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films,\ntelevision series and other content as well as Premium Subscriptions, which allowing our users to pay for ad-free\ncontent from various content publishers, all on one streaming channel. We have incurred, and will continue to\nincur, costs and expenses in connection with the development, expansion and operation of The Roku Channel, which we\nmonetize primarily through advertising. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we acquired global content\ndistribution rights, including rights to certain projects in development, from the mobile-first video distribution\nservice known as Quibi, and announced\n19\nthat The Roku Channel will become the home of such content.If our users do not continue to stream the free, ad-\nsupported content we make available on The Roku Channel, we will not have the opportunity to monetize The Roku\nChannel through revenue generated from advertising. In order to attract users to the ad-supported content on The\nRoku Channel and drive streaming of ad-supported video on The Roku Channel, we must secure rights to stream content\nthat is appealing to our users and advertisers. In part, we do this by directly licensing certain content from\ncontent owners, such as television and movie studios. The agreements that we enter into with these content owners\nhave varying terms and provide us with rights to make specific content available through The Roku Channel during\ncertain periods of time. Upon expiration of these agreements, we are required to re-negotiate and renew these\nagreements with the content owners, or enter into new agreements with other content owners, in order to obtain\nrights to distribute additional titles or to extend the duration of the rights previously granted. If we are unable\nto enter into content license agreements on acceptable terms to access content that enables us to attract and\nretain users of the ad-supported content on The Roku Channel, or if the content we do secure rights to stream,\nincluding for example the content that we acquired through theQuibitransaction described above, is ultimately not\nappealing to our users and advertisers, usage of The Roku Channel may decline, and our business may be harmed.\nFurthermore, if the advertisements on The Roku Channel are not relevant to our users or such advertisements are\noverly intrusive and impede our users’ enjoyment of the available content, our users may not stream content and\nview advertisements on The Roku Channel, and The Roku Channel may not generate sufficient revenue from advertising\nto be cost effective for us to operate, regardless of our ability to sell Premium Subscriptions. In addition, we\ndistribute The Roku Channel on platforms other than our own streaming platform, and there can be no assurance that\nwe will be successful in attracting a large number of users and/or generating significant revenue from advertising\nthrough the distribution of The Roku Channel on such other streaming platforms.\nIf our users sign up for offerings and services outside of our platform or through other channels on our platform,\nour business may be harmed.\nWe earn revenue by acquiring subscribers for certain of our content publishers activated on or through our\nplatform. If users do not use our platform for these purchases or subscriptions for any reason, and instead pay for\nservices directly with content publishers or by other means that we do not receive attribution for, our business\nmay be harmed. In addition, certain channels available on our platform allow users to purchase additional streaming\nservices from within their channels. The revenue we earn from these transactions is generally not equivalent to the\nrevenue we earn from activations on or through our platform that we receive full attribution credit for.\nFurthermore, for Premium Subscriptions, we only earn revenue for SVOD channels, including subscriptions to these\nservices through The Roku Channel. Accordingly, if users activate subscriptions for SVOD channels, including\nchannels available as Premium Subscriptions, other than on our platform, our business may be harmed.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that will be impacted by many factors that our outside of our control,\nwhich makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nTV streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth\nand profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our products and streaming\nplatform are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an\nentertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access,\nthe quality of broadband content delivery, the quality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for\nusers relative to other sources of content, as well as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across\nstreaming platforms. Accordingly, the future evolution of TV streaming as an industry, which is likely to impact\nour success, is dependent many of the factors that are outside of our control.\nChanges in consumer viewing habits could harm our business.\nThe manner in which consumers access streaming content is changing rapidly. As the technological infrastructure for\ninternet access continues to improve and evolve, consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access\nvideo, music and games on-demand with interactive capabilities. Time spent on mobile devices is growing rapidly, in\nparticular by young adults streaming content as well as content from cable or satellite providers available live or\non-demand on mobile devices. In addition, personal computers, smart TVs, DVD players, Blu-ray players, gaming\nconsoles and cable set-top boxes allow users to access streaming content. If other streaming or technology\nproviders are able to respond and take advantage of changes in consumer viewing habits and technologies better than\nus, our business could be harmed.\n20\nNew entrants may enter the TV streaming market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing video. In\naddition, our competitors may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive\npositions. If new technologies render the TV streaming market obsolete or we are unable to successfully compete\nwith current and new competitors and technologies, our business will be harmed.\nWe and our Roku TV brand partners depend on our retail sales channels to effectively market and sell our players\nand Roku TV models, and if we or our partners fail to maintain and expand effective retail sales channels, we could\nexperience lower player or Roku TV model sales.\nTo continue to increase our active accounts, we must maintain and expand our retail sales channels. The majority of\nour players and our TV brand partners' Roku TV models are sold through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such\nas Best Buy, Target and Walmart, including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon. To a\nlesser extent, we sell players directly through our website and internationally through distributors. For the year\nended December 31, 2020, Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart in total accounted for 69% of our player segment revenue.\nThese three retailers collectively accounted for 72% and 68% of our player revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2019 and 2018, respectively. These retailers and our international distributors also sell products offered by our\ncompetitors. We have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these retailers or\ndistributors. If one or several retailers or distributors were to discontinue selling our players or our TV brand\npartners' Roku TV models, choose not to prominently display those devices in their stores or on their websites, or\nclose or severely limit access to their brick and mortar locations because of shutdowns related to the COVID-19\npandemic, the volume of our streaming devices sold could decrease, which would harm our business. If any of our\nexisting TV brands choose to work exclusively with, or divert a significant portion of their business with us to,\nother operating system developers, this may impact our ability to license the Roku OS and our smart TV reference\ndesign to TV brands and our ability to continue to grow active accounts. Traditional retailers have limited shelf\nand end cap space in their stores and limited promotional budgets, and online retailers have limited prime website\nproduct placement space. Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product\nlines and stronger brand identity, such as Amazon or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers. In\naddition, one of our online retailers, Amazon, sells its own competitive streaming devices and is able to market\nand promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer or promote our devices on its\nwebsite. Any reduction in our ability to place and promote our devices, or increased competition for available\nshelf or website placement, could require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain our product\nvisibility or result in reduced visibility for our products, which may harm our business. In particular, the\navailability of product placement during peak retail periods, such as the holiday season, is critical to our\nrevenue growth, and if we are unable to effectively sell our devices during these periods, our business would be\nharmed.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand and maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users, and our business may be harmed.\nBuilding and maintaining a strong brand is important to attract and retain users, as potential users have a number\nof TV streaming choices. Successfully building a brand is a time consuming and comprehensive endeavor and can be\npositively and negatively impacted by any number of factors. Certain factors, such as the quality or pricing of our\nplayers or our customer service, are within our control. Other factors, such as the quality and reliability of Roku\nTV models and the quality of the content that our content publishers provide, may be out of our control, yet users\nmay nonetheless attribute those factors to us. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness\nand market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors are larger companies and promote\ntheir brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and TV commercials, and have substantial\nresources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also have greater resources to utilize digital advertising\nor website product placement more effectively than we can. If we are unable to execute on building a strong brand,\nit may be difficult to differentiate our business and streaming platform from our competitors in the marketplace,\ntherefore our ability to attract and retain users may be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur streaming platform allows our users to choose from thousands of channels, representing a variety of content\nfrom a wide range of content publishers. Our users can choose and control which channels they download and watch,\nand they can use certain settings to prevent channels from being downloaded to our streaming devices. While we have\npolicies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities or violates third-\nparty rights, among other things, we may distribute channels that include controversial content. Controversies\nrelated to the content included on certain of the channels that we distribute could result in negative publicity,\ncause harm to our reputation and brand, or subject us to claims and may harm our business.\n21\nWe are subject to payment-related risks and, if our advertisers or advertising agencies do not pay or dispute their\ninvoices, our business may be harmed.\nMany of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency\nis not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential\nliability. Contracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles,\nmay subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to contract directly with advertisers. This credit risk may\nvary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In addition, typically, we are\ncontractually required to pay advertising inventory data suppliers within a negotiated period of time, regardless\nof whether our advertisers or advertising agencies pay us on time, or at all. In addition, we typically experience\nslow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in the advertising industry. While we attempt to balance\npayment periods with our suppliers and advertisers and advertising agencies, we are not always successful. As a\nresult, we can often face a timing issue with our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivables,\nrequiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit losses.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with agencies and their advertisers over the operation of our streaming\nplatform, the terms of our agreements or our billings for purchases made by them through on our streaming platform\nor through our DSP. If we are unable to collect or make adjustments to bills, we could incur credit losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In\nthe future, bad debt may exceed reserves for such contingencies and our bad debt exposure may increase over time.\nAny increase in write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. If we are not paid by our advertisers or advertising agencies on time or at all,\nour business may be harmed.\nThe quality of our customer support is important to our users and licensees, and, if we fail to provide adequate\nlevels of customer support, we could lose users and licensees, which would harm our business.\nOur users and licensees depend on our customer support organization to resolve any issues relating to our devices.\nA high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our devices. We currently outsource\nour customer support operation to a third-party customer support organization. If we do not effectively train,\nupdate and manage our third-party customer support organization to assist our users, and if that support\norganization does not succeed in helping them quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could\nadversely affect our ability to sell our devices to users and harm our reputation with potential new users and our\nlicensees.\nWe must successfully manage streaming device and other product introductions and transitions to remain competitive.\nWe must continually develop new and improved streaming devices and other products that meet changing consumer\ndemands. Moreover, the introduction of a new streaming device or other product is a complex task, involving\nsignificant expenditures in research and development, promotion and sales channel development. For example, in\n2018, we introduced our Roku TV Wireless Speakers, designed specifically for use with Roku TV models, in 2019 we\nintroduced our Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer, and in 2020 we launched our Roku Streambar. Whether\nusers will broadly adopt new streaming devices or other products is not certain. Our future success will depend on\nour ability to develop new and competitively priced streaming devices and other products and add new desirable\ncontent and features to our streaming platform. Moreover, we must introduce new streaming devices and other\nproducts in a timely and cost-effective manner, and we must secure production orders for those products from our\ncontract manufacturers. The development of new streaming devices and other products is a highly complex process,\nand while our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems, we do not expect\nthat all of our projects will be successful. The successful development and introduction of new streaming devices\nand products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe accuracy of our forecasts for market requirements beyond near term visibility;\nour ability to anticipate and react to new technologies and evolving consumer trends;\nour development, licensing or acquisition of new technologies;\nour timely completion of new designs and development;\nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to cost-effectively manufacture our new products;\nthe availability of materials and key components used in manufacturing;\n22\ntariffs and trade and export restrictions by the U.S. or foreign governments which could impact the pricing\nand availability of such devices and depress consumer demand; limit the ability of our contract\nmanufacturers to obtain key parts, components, software, and technologies; lead to shortages; and\nour ability to attract and retain world-class research and development personnel.\nIf any of these or other factors materializes, we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers, and\nour operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to\nbuild our players, smart soundbars, wireless subwoofers and our wireless speakers. Our contract manufacturers are\nvulnerable to:\ncapacity constraints,\nreduced component availability,\nproduction disruptions or delays, including from strikes, mechanical issues, quality control issues, natural\ndisasters, and public health crises, such as the pandemic caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, known\nas COVID-19; and\nthe impact of U.S. or foreign tariffs or trade restrictions on components, finished goods, software, or\nother products;\nincreases in U.S. tariffs on imports of our players; and\nforeign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for finished players or other Roku products that are assembled\nin Asia.\nAs a result, we have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs, particularly when\ncomponents are in short supply or when we introduce new streaming devices or other products. For example, during\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2020, one of our contract manufacturers experienced extended factory closures related\nto the spread of COVID-19 resulting in supply chain disruptions for our players and elevated air freight costs to\nmeet demand.\nWe also have limited control over our contract manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely\non them to manufacture our players and other products to our quality and performance standards and specifications.\nDelays, component shortages and other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail distribution of our\nplayers and other products and ultimately our brand. Furthermore, any adverse change in our contract manufacturer’s\nfinancial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply our players or other products to our retailers\nand distributors.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers generally do not obligate them to supply our players or other\nproducts in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In the event our contract manufacturers are unable to\nfulfill our production requirements in a timely manner, their costs increase because of U.S. or international\ntariffs or export or import restrictions, or they decide to terminate their relationship with us, our order\nfulfillment may be delayed, and we would have to identify, select and qualify acceptable alternative contract\nmanufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a\nposition to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and performance\nstandards or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at our contract manufacturers for any reason\ncould require us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn\nwould reduce our revenue, or to incur higher freight costs than anticipated, which would negatively impact our\nplayer gross margin. In addition, our contract manufacturer’s facilities are located in Southeast Asia, the\nPeople’s Republic of China and Brazil and may be subject to political, economic, labor, trade, social and legal\nuncertainties that may harm or disrupt our relationships with these parties. We believe that the international\nlocation of these facilities increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions, tariffs, and trade\nrestrictions on exports or imports. Furthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality of our products,\nincluding players and audio products, could harm our business.\nIf our contract manufacturers fail for any reason to continue manufacturing our players or other products in\nrequired volumes and at high quality levels, or at all, we would have to identify, select and qualify acceptable\nalternative contract manufacturers. Alternative contract manufacturers may not be available to us when needed, or\nat all, or may not be\n23\nin a position to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices, to our quality and\nperformance standards, or at all. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at a contract manufacturer could\nrequire us to reduce our supply of players or other products to our retailers and distributors, which in turn would\nreduce our revenue, active account growth or streaming hour growth.\nCertain Roku TV brands do not have manufacturing capabilities and primarily depend upon contract manufacturers, and\nthe supply of Roku TV models to the market could be disrupted if they encounter problems with their contract\nmanufacturers or suppliers.\nCertain Roku TV brands do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and primarily rely upon contract\nmanufacturers to build the Roku TV models that they sell to retailers. Their contract manufacturers may be\nvulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability, increases in U.S. tariffs on imports of Roku\nTV models, future possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies or dealings with certain\ncountries or parties, foreign tariffs on U.S. parts or components for Roku TV models that are assembled outside of\nthe U.S., and their control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs, particularly when components\nare in short supply may be limited. Delays, component shortages, factory shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and\nother manufacturing and supply problems could impair the retail distribution of their Roku TV models. A significant\ninterruption in the supply of Roku TV models to retailers and distributors could, in turn, reduce our active\naccounts and streaming hours.\nFurthermore, any manufacturing issues affecting the quality of our Roku TV brand partners’ Roku TV models, could\nharm our brand and our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements and manage our inventory with our contract\nmanufacturers, we could incur additional costs, experience manufacturing delays and lose revenue.\nWe bear supply risk under our contract manufacturing arrangements. Lead times for the materials and components that\nour contract manufacturers order on our behalf through different component suppliers vary significantly and depend\non numerous factors, including the specific supplier, contract terms and market demand for a component at a given\ntime. Lead times for certain key materials and components incorporated into our players or other products are\ncurrently lengthy, requiring our contract manufacturers to order materials and components several months in\nadvance. If we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components\nand build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components that are\nunique to our products or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or\nproducts. In the past, we have agreed to reimburse our contract manufacturers for purchased components that were\nnot used as a result of our decision to discontinue a certain model of player or the use of particular components.\nIf we incur costs to cover excess supply commitments, this would harm our business.\nConversely, if we underestimate our player or other product requirements, our contract manufacturers may have\ninadequate component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our players or other products and result\nin delays or cancellation of orders from retailers and distributors. In addition, from time to time we have\nexperienced unanticipated increases in demand that resulted in the need to ship players via air freight, which is\nmore expensive than ocean freight, and adversely affected our player gross margin during such periods of high\ndemand, for example, during end-of-year holidays. If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements,\nour business may be harmed.\nOur players incorporate key components from sole source suppliers and if our contract manufacturers are unable to\nsource these components on a timely basis, due to fabrication capacity issues or other material supply constraints,\nwe will not be able to deliver our players to our retailers and distributors.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for key components in our players. Our players utilize specific system on chip,\nor SoC, Wi-Fi silicon products and Wi-Fi front-end modules from various manufacturers, depending on the player, for\nwhich we do not have a second source. Although this approach allows us to maximize player performance on lower cost\nhardware, reduce engineering qualification costs and develop stronger relationships with our strategic suppliers,\nthis also creates supply chain risk. These sole-source suppliers could be constrained by fabrication capacity\nissues or material supply issues, such as tariffs or other export or import restrictions on U.S. parts or\ncomponents for finished players that are used in final assembly of their components or on the finished players\nthemselves. There is also the risk that the strategic supplier may stop producing such components, cease operations\nor be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, our competitors or other companies, or become subject\nto U.S. or foreign sanctions or export control restrictions or penalties.\n24\nSuch suppliers may also face production, shipping, or logistical constraints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny such interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components from alternative sources, which may not be\navailable. Switching from a sole-source supplier would require that we redesign our players to accommodate new\ncomponents and would require us to re-qualify our players with regulatory bodies, such as the Federal\nCommunications Commission (“FCC”), which would be costly and time-consuming.\nOur reliance on sole-source suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\nsupplier capacity constraints;\nprice increases;\ntimely delivery;\ncomponent quality; and\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies.\nAny interruption in the supply of sole-source components for our players could adversely affect our ability to meet\nscheduled player deliveries to our retailers and distributors, result in lost sales and higher expenses and harm\nour business.\nOur players and Roku TV models must operate with various offerings, technologies and systems from our content\npublishers that we do not control. If our streaming devices do not operate effectively with those offerings,\ntechnologies and systems, our business may be harmed.\nThe Roku OS is designed for performance using relatively low-cost hardware, which enables us to drive user growth\nwith our players and Roku TV models offered at a low cost to consumers. However, this hardware must be\ninteroperable with all channels and other offerings, technologies and systems from our content publishers,\nincluding virtual multi-channel video programming distributors. We have no control over these offerings,\ntechnologies and systems beyond our channel certification requirements, and if our players and Roku TV models do\nnot provide our users with a high-quality experience on those offerings on a cost-effective basis or if changes are\nmade to those offerings that are not compatible with our players or Roku TV models, we may be unable to increase\nactive account growth and user engagement, we may be required to increase our hardware costs and our business will\nbe harmed. We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly and we have experienced that it takes time to\noptimize such products to function well with these offerings, technologies and systems. In addition, many of our\nlargest content publishers have the right to test and certify our new products before we can publish their channels\non these devices. The certification processes can be time consuming and introduce third-party dependencies into our\nproduct release cycles. If content publishers do not certify new products on a timely basis or require us to make\nchanges in order to obtain certifications, our product release plans may be adversely impacted, or we may not\ncontinue to offer certain channels. To continue to grow our active accounts and user engagement, we will need to\nprioritize development of our streaming devices to work better with new offerings, technologies and systems. If we\nare unable to maintain consistent operability of our devices that is on parity with or better than other platforms,\nour business could be harmed. In addition, any future changes to offerings, technologies and systems from our\ncontent publishers, such as virtual service operators, may impact the accessibility, speed, functionality, and\nother performance aspects of our streaming devices. We may not successfully develop streaming devices that operate\neffectively with these offerings, technologies or systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and\nuse these offerings, technologies or systems, our business could be harmed.\nOur streaming devices are technically complex and may contain undetected hardware errors or software bugs, which\ncould manifest themselves in ways that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur streaming devices and those of our licensees are technically complex and have contained and may in the future\ncontain undetected software bugs or hardware errors. These bugs and errors can manifest themselves in any number of\nways in our devices or our streaming platform, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities,\ndata quality in logs or interpretation of data, malfunctions or even permanently disabled devices. Some errors in\nour devices may only be discovered after a device has been shipped and used by users and may in some cases only be\ndetected under certain circumstances or after extended use. We also update the Roku OS and our software on a\nregular basis, and, despite our quality assurance processes, we could introduce bugs in the process of any such\nupdate. The introduction of a serious software bug could result in devices becoming permanently disabled. We offer\na limited one-year warranty in the United States and any such defects discovered in our devices after commercial\nrelease could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and users and\nincreased service costs, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We could\nalso face claims for product or information liability, tort or breach of warranty, or other violations of laws or\nregulations. In addition, our contracts with users contain provisions\n25\nrelating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit,\nregardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s\nperception of Roku and our products. In addition, if our insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is\nunavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.\nComponents used in our products may fail as a result of manufacturing, design or other defects over which we have\nno control and render our devices permanently inoperable.\nWe rely on third-party component suppliers to provide certain functionalities needed for the operation and use of\nour products. Any errors or defects in such third-party technology could result in errors in our products that\ncould harm our business. If these components have a manufacturing, design or other defect, they can cause our\nproducts to fail and render them permanently inoperable. For example, the typical means by which our users connect\ntheir home networks to our players is by way of a Wi-Fi access point in the home network router. If the Wi-Fi\nreceiver in our player fails, then our player cannot detect a home network’s Wi-Fi access point, and our player\nwill not be able to display or deliver any content to the TV screen. As a result, we may have to replace these\nplayers at our sole cost and expense. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, our reputation in the\nmarket could be adversely affected and our replacement of these players would harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary or desirable third-party technology licenses, our ability to develop new\nstreaming players or platform enhancements may be impaired.\nWe utilize commercially available off-the-shelf technology in the development of our players and streaming\nplatform. As we continue to introduce new features or improvements to our players and our streaming platform, we\nmay be required to license additional technologies from third parties. These third-party licenses may be\nunavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain necessary third-party\nlicenses, we may be required to obtain substitute technologies with lower quality or performance standards, or at a\ngreater cost, any of which could harm the competitiveness of our players, streaming platform and our business.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve\nor maintain profitability.\nWe began operations in 2002 and we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations in each year\nsince inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $332.4 million and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 we experienced a net loss of $17.5 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the\nfuture as we continue to expand our operations. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than\nour operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. We expect to incur significant\nlosses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties\ndescribed herein. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays and other factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our expenses exceed our\nrevenue, we may never achieve or maintain profitability and our business may be harmed.\nOur quarterly operating results may be volatile and are difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we\nfail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue, gross profit and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear and may fail to match our past performance due to a variety of factors, including many factors that are\noutside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results and cause the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\nthe entrance of new competitors or competitive products or services, whether by established or new\ncompanies;\nour ability to retain and grow our active account base, increase engagement among new and existing users,\nand monetize our streaming platform;\nour ability to maintain effective pricing practices, in response to the competitive markets in which we\noperate or other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation or increased taxes;\nour revenue mix, which drives gross profit;\nsupply of advertising inventory on our advertising platform and advertiser demand for advertising inventory;\n26\nseasonal, cyclical or other shifts in revenue from advertising or player sales;\nthe timing of the launch of new or updated products, channels or features;\nthe addition or loss of popular content or channels;\nthe expense and availability of content to license for The Roku Channel;\nthe ability of retailers to anticipate consumer demand;\nan increase in the manufacturing or component costs of our players or the manufacturing or component costs\nof our TV brand licensees for Roku TV models;\ndelays in delivery of our players or our partners’ Roku TV models, or disruptions in our or our licensees’\nsupply or distribution chains, including any disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs, or other\ntrade restrictions or disruptions; and\nan increase in costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, defending against third-party\nintellectual property infringement allegations or procuring rights to third-party intellectual property.\nOur gross margins vary across our devices and platform offerings. Our player segment revenue has a lower gross\nmargin compared to our platform segment revenue derived through our arrangements with advertising, content\ndistribution, billing, and licensing activities. Gross margins on our players vary across player models and can\nchange over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, component costs, player\nreturns and other cost fluctuations. In addition, our gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as\noverall profitability, may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in device, geographic or sales channel mix,\ncomponent cost increases, price competition, or the introduction of new streaming devices, including those that\nhave higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. We have in the past and may in the future strategically\nreduce our player gross margin in an effort to increase the number of active accounts and grow our gross profit. As\na result, our player segment revenue may not increase as rapidly as it has historically, or at all, and, unless we\nare able to continue to increase our platform revenue and grow the number of active accounts, we may be unable to\ngrow gross profit and our business will be harmed. If a reduction in gross margin does not result in an increase in\nour active accounts or increase our platform revenue and gross profit, our financial results may suffer, and our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nIf we have difficulty managing our growth in operating expenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our research and development, sales and marketing, support services,\noperations, and general and administrative functions in recent years and expect to continue to expand these\nactivities. Our historical growth has placed, and expected future growth will continue to place, significant\ndemands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources, to:\nmanage a larger organization;\nhire more employees, including engineers with relevant skills and experience;\nexpand internationally;\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts;\nexpand the capacity to manufacture and distribute our players;\nbroaden our customer support capabilities;\nsupport a larger number of TV brand and service operators;\nimplement appropriate operational and financial systems; and\nmaintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our business\nwill be harmed.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our international operations and our international expansion plans, if\nimplemented, will subject us to a variety of risks that may harm our business.\nWe currently generate the vast majority of our revenue in the United States and have limited experience marketing,\nselling, licensing and supporting our devices and running or monetizing our streaming platform outside the United\nStates. In addition, we have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization. While\nwe intend to continue to explore opportunities to expand our business in international markets in which we see\ncompelling opportunities, we may not be able to create or maintain international market demand for our devices and\nstreaming platform.\n27\nIn the course of expanding our international operations and operating overseas, in addition to the risks we face in\nthe United States, we will be subject to a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\ndiffering regulatory requirements, including country-specific data privacy and security laws and\nregulations, consumer protection laws and regulations, tax laws, trade laws, labor regulations, tariffs,\nexport quotas, custom duties on cross-border movements of goods or data flows, extension of limits on TV\nadvertising minutes to OTT advertising, local content requirements, data or data processing localization\nrequirements, or other trade restrictions;\ncompliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption\nlaws, U.S. or foreign export controls and sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to\ngovernment officials;\ncompliance with various privacy, data transfer, data protection, accessibility, consumer protection and\nchild protection laws in the European Union (“EU”) and other international markets that we operate in;\nslower adoption and acceptance of streaming devices and services in other countries;\ncompetition with other devices that consumers may use to stream TV or existing local traditional pay TV\nservices and products, including those provided by incumbent pay TV service providers;\ngreater difficulty supporting and localizing our streaming devices and streaming platform, including\ndelivering support and training documentation in languages other than English;\nour ability to deliver or provide access to popular streaming channels or content to users in certain\ninternational markets;\ndifferent or unique competitive pressures as a result of, among other things, the presence of local consumer\nelectronics companies and the greater availability of free content on over-the-air channels in certain\ncountries;\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in areas targeted for expansion;\nchallenges inherent in efficiently staffing and managing an increased number of employees over large\ngeographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, compensation and\nbenefits, and compliance programs;\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign\njurisdictions;\ndiffering legal and court systems, including limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\nunstable political and economic conditions whatever the cause, including pandemics, impacts from the United\nKingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), tariffs, trade wars, local or global\nrecessions, or long-term environmental risks;\ninternational political or social unrest or economic instability, including U.S.-China tensions, and other\npolitical, security, or economic tensions between countries in which we do business or which serve as\nsources for Roku products;\nadverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations\ncould impact our judgment in determining our tax provision and effective tax rate;\nthe imposition of customs duties on cross-border data flows for streaming services, which are currently\nprohibited under the WTO’s e-commerce moratorium, but could be permitted if certain WTO Members continue to\noppose extension of the moratorium when it is considered at the WTO’s MC-12 Ministerial Meeting, which was\npostponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is scheduled to take place in 2021;\ndigital services taxes, which have been imposed or are under consideration by several European and other\ncountries, which would lead to taxes on certain digital services even though the providers would not be\nsubject to tax under existing international tax rules and treaties;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemics or epidemics could result in decreased economic activity in\ncertain markets, decreased use of our products or platform, or in our decreased ability to import, export,\nship, or sell our products to supply such services to existing or new customers in international markets;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our revenue and expenses of our international\noperations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings from certain jurisdictions;\nfuture possible changes in U.S. regulations on exports of U.S. technologies or dealings with certain\ncountries or parties, including expanding export control restrictions on China and Hong Kong; and\nworking capital constraints.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so\nsuccessfully and in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\n28\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to seasonality and if our sales during the holiday season fall below our\nexpectations, our business may be harmed.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. Specifically, our revenue and gross profit\nare traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and represent a high percentage of the total\nnet revenue for such fiscal year due to higher consumer purchases and increased advertising during holiday seasons.\nFurthermore, a significant percentage of our player sales through retailers in the fourth quarter are pursuant to\ncommitted sales agreements with retailers for which we recognize significant discounts in the average selling\nprices in the third quarter in an effort to grow our active accounts, which will reduce our player gross margin.\nGiven the seasonal nature of advertising and our device sales, accurate forecasting is critical to our operations.\nWe anticipate that this seasonal impact on revenue and gross profit is likely to continue, and any shortfall in\nexpected fourth quarter revenue due to a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, actions by our\ncompetitors, disruptions in our supply or distribution chain, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, or for any\nother reason, would cause our full year results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, delays or\ndisruptions at U.S. ports of entry could adversely affect our or our distributors’ ability to timely deliver\nplayers and co-branded Roku TV models to retailers during the holiday season. A substantial portion of our expenses\nare personnel related, including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and facilities related none of\nwhich are seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of a revenue shortfall, we would be unable to mitigate the\nnegative impact on gross profit and operating margins, at least in the short term, and our business would be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, effectively manage succession, or hire, develop, and motivate our\nemployees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy or continue to grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our senior management team\nand in our engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, operations and other organizations. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our devices and streaming platform, our culture and our\nstrategic direction. We do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with any of our key\npersonnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to promptly identify a suitable\nsuccessor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Our employees,\nparticularly engineers and other product developers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to\nidentifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. Because we face significant\ncompetition for personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located, to attract\ntop talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation packages\nbefore we can validate the productivity of those employees. To retain employees, we also may need to increase our\nemployee compensation levels in response to competition. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional\nskilled employees is necessary to support our growth could result in significant disruptions to our business, and\nthe integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause disruptions.\nWe believe a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition,\nmany of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, the equity ownership of many of our\nemployees could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business.\nWe need to maintain operational and financial systems that can support our expected growth, increasingly complex\nbusiness arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability or failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our financial reporting, billing and payment services.\nWe have a complex business that is growing in size and complexity both in the United States and in international\njurisdictions. To manage our growth and our increasingly complex business operations, especially as we move into\nnew markets internationally or acquire new businesses, we will need to maintain and may need to upgrade our\noperational and financial systems and procedures, which requires management time and may result in significant\nadditional expense. Our business arrangements with our content partners, advertisers, Roku TV brand partners and\nother licensees, and the rules that govern revenue and expense recognition in our business are increasingly\ncomplex. To manage the expected growth of our\n29\noperations and increasing complexity, we must maintain operational and financial systems, procedures and controls\nand continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations. An inability to do so will\nnegatively affect our financial reporting, billing and payment services. Our current and planned systems,\nprocedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and\nexpense recognition for our future operations and expected growth. Delays or problems associated with any\nimprovement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our\nrelationships with our users, content publishers, advertisers, advertisement agencies, Roku TV brand partners, or\nother licensees; cause harm to our reputation and brand; and could also result in errors in our financial and other\nreporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, which involve a number of risks, and if we are unable to address and resolve these\nrisks successfully, such acquisitions could harm our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses, products or technologies to expand our offerings and\ncapabilities, user base and business. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of\npotential strategic transactions; however, we have limited experience completing or integrating acquisitions. Any\nacquisition could be material to our financial condition and results of operations and any anticipated benefits\nfrom an acquisition may never materialize. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity\nsecurities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable\naccounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property\nclaims, and may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the\nacquisitions. In addition, the process of integrating acquired businesses, products or technologies may create\nunforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies in\ninternational markets would involve additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across\ndifferent cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks\nassociated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without\nincurring significant costs, delays or other operational problems and if we were unable to address such risks\nsuccessfully our business could be harmed.\nWe have outstanding debt and our credit facility provides our lender with a first-priority lien against\nsubstantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may\nlimit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe entered into a credit agreement among us, as borrower, the lenders and issuing banks from time to time party\nthereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., or the Agent providing for a (i) a four-year revolving credit\nfacility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-\nyear delayed draw term loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, (the “Term Loan A\nFacility”) and (iii) an uncommitted incremental facility subject to certain conditions (collectively, the “Credit\nAgreement”). The Credit Agreement contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants, which may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry\nor take future actions. The Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum\nadjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on the basis of the\nprior period of our four consecutive fiscal quarters. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we granted the Agent a\nsecurity interest in substantially all of our assets. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior Secured Term Loan A and\nRevolving Credit Facilities.”\nIn November 2019, we borrowed $100.0 million aggregate principal amount pursuant to the Term Loan A Facility and in\nMarch 2020, we borrowed $69.3 million aggregate principal amount of revolving loans pursuant to the Revolving\nCredit Facility. In May 2020, weentered into the Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which we sold 4.0\nmillion shares of our Class A common stock at an average selling price of $126.01 per share, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $504.0 million, a portion of which was used to repay the$69.3 million outstanding under our Revolving\nCredit Facility. We also have outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 totaling $30.8 million against\nthe Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.\nHowever, if we fail to comply with the covenants, make payments as specified in the Credit Agreement, or undergo\nany other event of default contained in the Credit Agreement, the Agent could declare an event of default, which\nwould give it the right to terminate the commitments to provide additional loans and declare any borrowings\noutstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition,\nthe Agent would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Credit\nAgreement. If the outstanding debt under the\n30\nCredit Agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient assets to repay it,\nwhich would harm our business and financial condition.\nWhen we borrowed pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, we chose a variable interest rate based on London\nInter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the\nsubject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for phase out. The future of LIBOR\nat this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity\nrelated to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.The\nconsequences of the developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the value of our\nLIBOR-linked financial obligations, such as an increase in the cost of our credit agreement indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support planned business growth, and this\ncapital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support planned business growth and may require additional\nfunds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new devices and enhance our streaming\nplatform, maintain adequate levels of inventory to support our retail partners’ demand requirements, improve our\noperating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Our primary uses of cash\ninclude operating costs such as personnel-related expenses and capital spending. Our future capital requirements\nmay vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors including our growth rate and the\ncontinuing market acceptance of our streaming platform, the Roku OS and players along with the timing and effort\nrelated to the introduction of new platform features, players, hiring of experienced personnel, the expansion of\nsales and marketing activities, as well as overall economic conditions.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our then existing stockholders could suffer significant\ndilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of\nholders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses and an\nacceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain\nadequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be\nharmed.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could harm our reputation,\ncause us to modify our business practices and otherwise adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the\nordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive corporate,\npersonal and other information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, user payment\ncard information, other user information and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a\nsecure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Our obligations\nunder applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other documentation may\ninclude maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information in our possession or\ncontrol, maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as part of an information security program, and\nlimits on the use and/or cross-border transfer of such personal information. These obligations create potential\nlegal liability, to regulators, our business partners, our users, and other relevant stakeholders and also impact\nthe attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential users.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology\ninfrastructure) to third parties, or may have incorporated technology into our platform, that collects, processes,\ntransmits\n31\nand stores our users’ or others’ personal information (such as payment card information) and as a result, we manage\na number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our information technology systems (including our\ncomputer networks) or to our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract\nor outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. As a result, our information technology systems,\nincluding the functions of third parties that are involved or have access to those systems, is very large and\ncomplex. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nsecurity breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility and distributed nature of\nour information technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive or personal information stored on those\nsystems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external threats on\nour technology environment. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our\nemployees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are\nincreasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to,\nindustrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others.\nFor example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including any efforts to educate or train our employees, we remain vulnerable to phishing attacks.\nAlthough we have, and may in the future, implement remote working protocols and offer work-issued devices to\nemployees, the actions of our employees while working remotely may have a greater effect on the security of our\nsystems and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems or data arising from\nemployees’ combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that\nwe do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nThese risks have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are\ncontinuing to work from home as a result of government guidelines and internal policies that have been put in place\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information, other threats\ncould include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering\nand other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\ninformation. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the nature of our third-party web hosting, cloud\ncomputing, or network-dependent streaming services or suppliers. Our systems likely experience directed attacks on\nat least a periodic basis that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our users’, content publishers’\nand advertisers’ ability to access our platform; extract money from us; and/or obtain our data (including without\nlimitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information). Although we have implemented certain\nsystems, processes, and safeguards intended to protect our information technology systems and data from such\nthreats and mitigate risks to our systems and data, we cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a\nmaterial impact on our systems or services in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain\nthreats may not be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and data due to the developing\nsophistication and means of attack in the threat landscape. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an\nincreased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the\nsophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. Additionally, our third-party vendors or\nbusiness partners’ information technology systems may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business could be\naffected by those or similar third-party relationships.\nWe maintain insurance policies to cover certain losses relating to our information technology systems. However,\nthere may be exceptions to our insurance coverage such that our insurance policies may not cover some or all\naspects of a security incident. Even where an incident is covered by our insurance, the insurance limits may not\ncover the costs of complete remediation and redress that we may be faced with in the wake of a security incident.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or\nresults in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Though it is difficult to determine what harm\nmay directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability,\nsecurity and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users, business partners,\nregulators or other relevant stakeholders may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and\nattract new users. Because of our prominence in the TV streaming industry, we believe we may be a particularly\nattractive target for threat actors. Our platform also incorporates licensed software from third parties, including\nopen-source software, and we may also be vulnerable to attacks that focus on such third-party software. Any\nattempts by threat actors to\n32\ndisrupt our platform, our streaming devices, website, computer systems or our mobile apps, if successful, could\nharm our business, subject us to liability, be expensive to remedy, cause harm to our systems and operations and\ndamage our reputation. Efforts to prevent threat actors from entering our computer systems or exploiting\nvulnerabilities in our devices are expensive to implement and may not be effective in detecting or preventing\nintrusion or vulnerabilities. Such unauthorized access to our data could damage our reputation and our business and\ncould expose us to the risk of contractual damages, litigation and regulatory fines and penalties that could harm\nour business. The risk of harm to our business caused by security incidents may also increase as we expand our\nproduct and service offerings and as we enter into new markets. Implementing, maintaining, and updating security\nsafeguards requires substantial resources now and will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors’ and/or commercial partners’ information technology systems or\nother similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or\npersonal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions,\nwhether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our product development and our\nbusiness operations.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not\nbeen discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have\nnot discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to\nsystems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that\nleads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal\ninformation regarding our users, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming,\ndistracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require\nus to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and\ncontractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could\nresult in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\nFor example, in the wake of a data breach involving payment card data, we may be subject to substantial penalties\nand related enforcement for failure to adhere to the technical or operational security requirements of the Payment\nCard Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards (“DSS”) imposed by the PCI Council to protect cardholder data.\nPenalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be imposed by various entities\nwithin the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such\nenforcement could threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party\npayment processors.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy,\nconfidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further security\nincidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of\nsensitive information, which could include personal information, may result in governmental investigations,\nenforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others,\nand could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us including existing or\npotential users’ perceiving our platform, system or networks as less desirable or we could be subject to claims by\nthird parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and\nadversely affect our business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our\ncontracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages. Moreover,\ndata security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying\nthem may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended\nto protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as the personal and proprietary\ninformation that we possess or control, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent\nservice interruptions or further security incidents. Data protection laws around the world often require\n“reasonable”, “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation\nand application of those laws are often uncertain and evolving, and there can be no assurance that our security\nmeasures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security\nmeasures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not\nbe able to protect the information we maintain. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory\ncorrective action due to a data security incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result\nin substantial costs for years to come.\n33\nWe and our service providers collect, process, transmit and store the personal information of our users, which\ncreates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store information about a variety of individuals including our users and their\ndevices, and rely on third party service providers to collect, process, transmit and store personal information of\nour users, including our users’ payment card data. Further, we and our service providers as well as business\npartners use tracking technologies, including cookies, device identifiers and related technologies, to help us\nmanage and track our users’ interactions with our platform, devices, website and partners’ content to deliver\nrelevant advertising and personalized content for ourselves and on behalf of our partners on our devices.\nWe collect information about the interaction of users with our platform, devices, website, advertisements, and\ncontent publishers’ streaming channels. To deliver relevant advertisements effectively, we must successfully\nleverage this data as well as data provided by third parties. Our ability to collect and use such data could be\nrestricted by a number of factors, including users’ having the ability to refuse consent to or opt out from our,\nour service providers or our advertising partners’ collection and use of this data, restrictions imposed by\nadvertisers, content publishers and service providers, changes in technology, and developments in laws, regulations\nand industry standards. For example, certain EU laws and regulations prohibit access to or storage of information\non a user’s device (such as cookies and similar technologies that we use for advertising) that is not “strictly\nnecessary” to provide a user-requested service or used for the “sole purpose” of a transmission unless the user has\nprovided unambiguous, affirmative consent, and users may choose not to provide this consent to collection of\ninformation which is used for advertising purposes. Any restrictions on our ability to collect or use data could\nharm our ability to grow our revenue, particularly our platform revenue which depends on engaging the relevant\nrecipients of advertising campaigns.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations\ngovern the collection, use, retention, cross-border transfer, localization, sharing and security of the data we\nreceive from and about our users, employees and other individuals. The regulatory environment for the collection\nand use of personal information by device manufacturers, online service providers, content distributors,\nadvertisers and publishers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy groups and government\nbodies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys general, the European Commission and\nEuropean data protection authorities, have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to devices that\nidentify or are identifiable to a person (or household or device) and personal information collected through the\ninternet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The United States, U.S. states, and foreign\ngovernments have enacted and are considering laws and regulations that could significantly restrict industry\nparticipants’ ability to collect, use and share personal information, such as by regulating the level of consumer\nnotice and consent required before a company can place cookies or other tracking technologies. For example, the EU\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective in May 2018 and imposes detailed requirements related\nto the collection, storage and use of personal information related to people located in the EU or which is\nprocessed in the context of EU operations and places new data protection obligations and restrictions on\norganizations and may require us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future beyond what\nwe have already done.\nFurther, in the wake of Brexit, there has been uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the\nUnited Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018, and the EU may declare the\nUnited Kingdom’s privacy laws as adequate for receiving personal information from the EU, a level of uncertainty\nremains regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated after Brexit. We made changes\nto our data protection compliance program to prepare for the GDPR and will continue to monitor the implementation\nand evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are not compliant with GDPR or other data protection laws\nor regulations if and when implemented, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions\non personal information processing) and our business may be harmed. For example, under the GDPR, fines of up to EUR\n20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, whichever is greater, as well as data\nprocessing restrictions could be imposed for violation of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Other countries have\nalso proposed or passed legislation with obligations similar to that of the GDPR.\nThe U.S. data protection legal landscape also continues to evolve, with states such as California and Nevada having\nenacted broad-based data privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing\nto consider additional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects of this legislation are far-\nreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and\nexpenses in an effort to comply. Effective October 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal\nInformation Law (“SPI Law”) to\n34\nnow require, among other things, that certain businesses provide a designated request address to intake requests\nfrom consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect\nin January 2020 and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information such as\nrights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal\ninformation, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides\nfor civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data\nbreach litigation. The CCPA was amended and the California Office of the Attorney General published final\nregulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was\npassed into law and goes into effect on January 1, 2023 (with a ‘look-back’ to January 1, 2022). The CPRA builds on\nthe CCPA and amongst other things,requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate consumer privacy\nissues.\nData protection laws continue to proliferate throughout the world and such laws likely apply to our business. For\nexample, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) came into effect on August 15, 2020. The LGPD bears many\nsubstantive similarities to the GDPR such as extra-territorial reach, enhanced privacy rights for individuals, data\ntransfer restrictions and mandatory breach notification obligations. It carries penalties of up to 2% of a\ncompany’s Brazilian revenue.\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments\nto existing laws on our business.\nApplicable data privacy and security laws may also obligate us to employ security measures that are appropriate to\nthe nature of the data we collect and process and, among other factors, the risks attendant to our data processing\nactivities in order to protect personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental or\nunlawful destruction, loss, or alteration. We have implemented security measures that we believe are appropriate,\nbut a regulator could deem our security measures not to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in\ncertain data protection laws. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be\nsure that our chosen safeguards will protect against security threats to our business including the personal\ninformation that we process. However, even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance\nwith applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our information technology systems and the data\ncontained in those systems, or our data that is contained in third parties’ systems. Moreover, certain data\nprotection laws impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our\ndata processing. Our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase\nour vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for\nsuccessful access, acquisition or other disclosure of our data despite the quality and legal sufficiency of our\nsecurity measures.\nAs part of our data protection compliance program, we have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the\ntransfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the United States. However, there\nare certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of these data transfer mechanisms, the resolution of\nwhich may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal information from the EEA to the United States. On July\n16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU Court) ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield to be an invalid data\ntransfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding\nsupplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. We are currently awaiting regulatory\nguidance from EU Data Protection Authorities and the US Department of Commerce on the impact of this ruling on\nbroader international data transfer compliance for companies, including guidance on specific supplementary measures\nthat all companies would be required to implement in addition to the Model Clauses. This may involve changes that\nrequire significant time and resources to implement, including through adjusting our operations, conducting\nrequisite data transfer assessments, and revising our contracts. Our ability to continue to transfer personal\ninformation outside of the EU may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and\nliability under the GDPR, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers\nin the future. In addition, cloud service providers upon which our services depend are experiencing heightened\nscrutiny from EU regulators, which may lead to significant shifts or unavailability of cloud services to transfer\npersonal information outside the EU, which may significantly impact our costs or ability to operate.\nWe will continue to review our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our\npersonal information processing to cause our transfer and receipt of EEA residents’ personal information to conform\nto applicable European law. The regulation of data privacy in the EU continues to evolve, and it is not possible to\npredict the ultimate effect of evolving data protection regulation and implementation over time. Member states also\nhave some\n35\nflexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for\ncertain data processing activities.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted ‘data localization’ laws requiring that user data\nregarding users in their country be maintained in their country. Maintaining local data centers in individual\ncountries could increase our operating costs significantly. We expect that, in addition to the business as usual\ncosts of compliance, the evolving regulatory interpretation and enforcement of laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, as\nwell as other domestic and foreign data protection laws will lead to increased operational and compliance costs and\nwill require us to continually monitor and, where necessary, make changes to our operations, policies, and\nprocedures. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of\nsecurity of user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, contractual indemnity or public\nstatements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others. In addition to potential liability, these events could\nharm our business.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use and\ndisclosure of personal information, credit card information and/or other confidential information. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or\nmay be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving\ncompliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and\ndocumentation. Such failures can subject us to potential international, local, state and federal action if they are\nfound to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data\ncollection, use and security practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws,\nenactment of new laws, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our\ncost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal information and confidential information that we (or\nour service providers or business partners) collect, store or process could trigger contractual and legal\nobligations, harm our reputation, subject us to liability and otherwise adversely affect our business including our\nfinancial results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and process personal information (including payment card\ninformation) and/or other confidential information of our employees, our partners, and our users. We use third-\nparty service providers and subprocessors to help us deliver our services. These vendors may store or process\npersonal information, payment card information and/or other confidential information of our employees, our\npartners, or our users. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad\nand may store or process such information outside the country in which it was collected.\nA variety of state, national, and foreign laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection,\ndisclosure, security, transfer, cross-border transfer, localization, and other processing of personal information.\nThese privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and\nregulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different\ninterpretations. In addition, each state and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nEU member states, and the United Kingdom, as well as some other foreign nations, have passed laws requiring\nnotification to regulatory authorities, to affected users, and/or others within a specific timeframe when there has\nbeen a security breach involving certain personal information as well as impose additional obligations for\ncompanies. Additionally, our agreements with certain users or partners may require us to notify them in the event\nof a security breach. Such statutory and contractual disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may\ncause our users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend\nsignificant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived\nsecurity breach. Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development of new products and may\ncause reputational harm.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our platform,\nsystems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our users or other relevant stakeholders.\nThese proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management’s time and attention,\nincrease our costs of doing business, and/or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to\n36\nfundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products and/or platform capabilities in\nresponse to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business.Any actual or perceived inability\nto adequately protect the privacy of individuals’ information in our possession, custody or control may render our\nproducts or services less desirable and could harm our reputation and business. Any costs incurred as a result of\nthis potential liability could harm our business.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations could\nresult in a loss or degradation of service on our platform and could harm our business.\nWe rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the performance and operation of the\nRoku OS, streaming platform and computer systems. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the\nunavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our devices\nand streaming platform to existing and potential users. We utilize computer systems located either in our\nfacilities or those of third-party server hosting providers and third-party internet-based or cloud computing\nservices. Although we generally enter into service level agreements with these parties, we exercise no control over\ntheir operations, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays that they may experience. In the\nfuture, we may transition additional features of our services from our managed hosting systems to cloud computing\nservices, which may require significant expenditures and engineering resources. If we are unable to manage such a\ntransition effectively, we may experience operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nUpon the expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace\ntheir services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable\nto us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies\nuntil the transition is complete. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications\nfailures, break-ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. As\nwe do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our\noperations and could adversely affect our business. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could\nhave adverse impacts on our business reputation, customer relations and operating results.\nIf any aspect of our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize in our operations fails, it may lead to\ndowntime or slow processing time, either of which may harm the experience of our users. We have experienced, and\nmay in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of\nfactors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. We expect to continue\nto invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve the user experience and platform performance. To\nthe extent that we or our third-party service hosting provider do not effectively address capacity constraints,\nupgrade or patch systems as needed and continually develop technology and network architecture to accommodate\nincreasingly complex services and functions, increasing numbers of users, and actual and anticipated changes in\ntechnology, our business may be harmed.\nChanges in how network operators manage data that travel across their networks could harm our business.\nOur business relies upon the ability of our users to access high-quality streaming content through the internet. As\na result, the growth of our business depends on our users’ ability to obtain and maintain low-cost, high-speed\naccess to the internet, which relies in part on the network operators’ continuing willingness to upgrade and\nmaintain their equipment as needed to sustain a robust internet infrastructure as well as their continued\nwillingness to preserve the open and interconnected nature of the internet. We exercise no control over network\noperators, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays in their operations. Any material\ndisruption or degradation in internet services could harm our business.\nTo the extent that the number of internet users continues to increase, network congestion could adversely affect\nthe reliability of our streaming platform. We may also face increased costs of doing business if network operators\nengage in discriminatory practices with respect to streamed video content in an effort to monetize access to their\nnetworks by data providers. In the past, internet service providers have attempted to implement usage-based\npricing, bandwidth caps and traffic “shaping” or throttling. To the extent network operators were to create tiers\nof internet access service and either charge us for access to these tiers or prohibit our content offerings from\nbeing available on some or all of these tiers, our quality of service could decline, our operating expenses could\nincrease and our ability to attract and retain users could be impaired, each of which would harm our business.\nIn addition, most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers\nwith multichannel video programming. These network operators have an incentive to use their network\n37\ninfrastructure in a manner adverse to the continued growth and success of other companies seeking to distribute\nsimilar video programming. To the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their\nown data and content, as opposed to ours, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss of rights important to our devices and\nstreaming platform, cause us to incur significant legal costs or otherwise harm our business.\nSome internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties have asserted, and may in\nthe future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. As we grow and face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against\nus will grow. Plaintiffs who have no relevant product revenue may not be deterred by our own issued patents and\npending patent applications in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. The cost of patent\nlitigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, has been or could be substantial. Some of our\ncompetitors may be better able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings because of their\nsubstantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant\nmanagement time and divert management from our business. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and\ncontinuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nor at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or\nroyalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to\ngain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property\nlicenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the\nscope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products and services provided by us\nand our licensees. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual\nproperty; cease making, licensing or using technologies that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the\nintellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our products; enter into\npotentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,\ncontent or materials; and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. In addition, any lawsuits regarding\nintellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time\nand attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business and operating\nresults could be harmed.\nWe regard the protection of our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and other\nintellectual property or proprietary rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We seek to\nprotect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with all our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and any third parties\nwho have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology. However, we cannot be certain that we have\nexecuted such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who had\naccess to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. Any party\nwith whom we have executed such an agreement could potentially breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary\ninformation, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We\ncannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or\nthat competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially\nequivalent information and techniques. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing\na claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, time-consuming and could\nresult in substantial costs and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable.\nFurther, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and records as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the\n38\nenforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant\nproblems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may\nalso be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and\nother intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets or other sensitive\ninformation. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable\nto prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of\nour trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could\nharm our business.\nWe have filed and will in the future file patent applications on inventions that we deem to be innovative. There is\nno guarantee that our patent applications will issue as granted patents, that the scope of the protection gained\nwill be sufficient or that an issued patent may subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Patent laws, and\nscope of coverage afforded by them, have recently been subject to significant changes, such as the change to\n“first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This change in the\ndetermination of inventorship may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more\nfrequently to preserve rights in their inventions, which may favor larger competitors that have the resources to\nfile more patent applications. Another change to the patent laws may incentivize third parties to challenge any\nissued patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), as opposed to having to bring such an\naction in U.S. federal court. Any invalidation of a patent claim could have a significant impact on our ability to\nprotect the innovations contained within our devices and platform and could harm our business.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. We may fail to\ntake the necessary actions and to pay the applicable fees to obtain or maintain our patents. Noncompliance with\nthese requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or\ncomplete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to use our\ntechnologies and enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain\nlocations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or\nwhich we may not pursue in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets\nor determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature,\nregardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and\ntechnical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to\nmaintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our devices and our\nstreaming platform.\nWe incorporate open source software in our streaming platform. From time to time, companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their products and services have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source\nsoftware and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been\ninterpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on the sale of our devices. In such event, we could be required to make\nour proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses\nfrom third parties in order to continue offering our devices, to re-engineer our devices or to discontinue the sale\nof our devices in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could\nharm our business.\n39\nUnder our agreements with many of our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, contract manufacturer\nand suppliers, we are required to provide indemnification in the event our technology is alleged to infringe upon\nthe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn certain of our agreements we indemnify our content publishers, licensees, distributors, retailers, manufacturing\npartners and suppliers. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses defending these\npartners if they are sued for patent infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a partner were\nto lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary\nliabilities. In addition, because the devices sold by our licensing partners and Roku TV brands often involve the\nuse of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of\ninfringement asserted against the streaming device in question, even if the claim does not pertain to our\ntechnology.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and we are unable to predict the extent to which the\npandemic and related effects will continue to impact our business.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021, there has been widespread global impact from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and our business has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the pandemic and resulting\neconomic consequences. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to take precautionary measures intended to help\nminimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including mandatory work-from-home policies, suspending non-\nessential business travel and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We may take\nfurther actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our\nemployees, TV brand partners, content publishers, advertisers, retail and distribution partners, contract\nmanufacturers, services venders and supply chain. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to\nmitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and an extended period of remote work arrangements could disrupt\nour business, introduce business and operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and could make it more\ndifficult for us to effectively manage our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measures that we have taken in response have had a mixed impact on our\nbusiness during the year ended December 31, 2020. When staying-at-home restrictions were first issued in the first\nquarter of 2020, we saw an acceleration in both streaming hours, which has moderated since peaking in early in the\nsecond quarter, and account activations. In our platform segment, we experienced increases in trials of and\nsubscriptions to SVOD content, growth in the consumption of AVOD content, and increased purchases of TVOD content.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we experienced delays in the start of some video advertising campaigns and an\nincrease in advertising campaign cancellations. We also have encountered supply chain disruptions related to our\nplayers that resulted in elevated air freight costs to replenish inventory and meet increased demand. Additionally,\nat times some of our retail partners have had to close or severely limit access to their brick-and-mortar\nlocations, resulting in reduced sale of devices in these locations. For example, during the holiday season our\npartners saw fewer shoppers in their brick-and-mortar locations. Further, our management team has focused on\naddressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, which has required and will continue to require, a\nsignificant investment of their time and resources, and has diverted their attention away from other aspects of our\nbusiness. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 our management team took steps to slow the rate of growth\nof our operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our management team also monitored our liquidity and in May\n2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets\nInc., as sales agents (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which we sold 4.0 million shares of our\nClass A common stock at an average selling price of $126.01 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $504.0\nmillion, a portion of which was used to repay $69.3 million that we drew down on our Revolving Credit Facility in\nMarch 2020. Our management team will continue to evaluate our investments and initiatives for 2021 and will\ncontinue to monitor our liquidity as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business will depend on future developments, which\nare uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its\nseverity, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the virus or treat its impacts, the development\nand rollout of effective vaccines, possible variants of the virus that render vaccines ineffective, and how quickly\nand to what extent economic and operating conditions normalize. As staying-at-home restrictions are eased consumers\nmay spend less time streaming TV, which could reduce our streaming hours and number of active accounts and also\ncould negatively impact our platform revenue if we experience a decrease in sales of advertising or transactional\nrevenue shares from content\n40\npublishers. We also may incur significant operating costs and be exposed to increased liability risks as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, both now and increasingly as once staying-at-home restrictions are lifted and employees\nbegin to return to our offices, such as the cost of collecting additional information (including health and medical\ninformation) about our employees, contractors and visitors at our facilities; and testing supplies and personal\nprotective equipment for on-site staff. In addition, with the increase in remote working during the COVID-19\npandemic, we may not be able to maintain the same level of control over the security of our systems or the personal\ninformation that we collect, store and process, particularly as cyber attackers appear to increasingly attempt to\ncompromise systems and data in an effort to exploit this pandemic. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic itself has\nsubsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of any global economic impact,\nincluding as a result of an ongoing recession. For instance, a prolonged economic downturn may result in the\npurchase of fewer streaming devices which could lead to a reduction in account activations and streaming hours, and\nalso could negatively impact our revenue. Our platform business also may be negatively impacted by decreases in\ntotal advertising spend, if advertising budgets do not continue to shift to OTT advertising or if acquiring content\nthat our users want to watch becomes more difficult or costly for us or our content partners as the amount of new\ncontent decreases due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged economic downturn could also impact the overall\nfinancial condition of our TV brand partners, content publishers, advertisers, retailers, contract manufacturer,\nservices venders and supply chain all of whom we depend on in order to operate our business. As a result, the\ncurrent level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means the impact on\nour business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt and impact our business.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss,\ninternet failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, medical epidemic or\npandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), other man-made disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt our\nbusiness operations. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in\norder to fully resume operations. In particular, our principal offices are located in California, our contract\nmanufacturer and some of our suppliers are located in Asia both of which are regions known for seismic activity\nmaking our operations in these areas vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions in these areas.\nOur insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. If our streaming platform was to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or\nother event, our ability to deliver streaming content, including advertising, to our users would be impaired.\nDisruptions in the operations of our contract manufacturer as a result of a disaster or other catastrophic event\ncould delay the manufacture and shipment of our players or other products, which could impact our business. If we\nare unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a\ndisaster or other catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or\ncatastrophic event, our business would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf government regulations or laws relating to the internet, video, advertising, or other areas of our business\nchange, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to the internet\nand online services, which may include laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, consumer\nprotection, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, telecommunications, social media,\npayment processing, taxation, intellectual property, competition, electronic contracts, internet access, net\nneutrality, advertising, calling and texting, content restrictions, protection of children and accessibility, among\nothers. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Litigation and\nregulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the laws and regulations governing issues such as data privacy\nand security, payment processing, taxation, net neutrality, video, telecommunications, e-commerce tariffs and\nconsumer protection related to the internet continue to develop. For example, laws relating to the liability of\nproviders of online services for activities of their users and other third parties have been tested by a number of\nclaims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark\ninfringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the advertisements\nposted, actions taken or not taken by providers in response to user activity or the content provided by users.\nCongress has also enacted legislation related to liability of providers of online services and may continue to\nlegislate in this area. The CCPA and Nevada SPI Law also apply to entities that do business in California and\nNevada, respectively, and\n41\nimpose a number of requirements on internet and online services. Moreover, as internet commerce and advertising\ncontinue to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities becomes more likely.\nAs we develop new services and devices, and improve our streaming platform, we may also be subject to new laws and\nregulations specific to such technologies. For example, in developing our Roku TV reference design, we were\nrequired to understand, address and comply with an evolving regulatory framework for developing, manufacturing,\nmarketing and selling TVs. If we fail to adequately address or comply with such regulations regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of TVs, we may be subject to fines or sanctions, and our licensees may be unable to sell Roku\nTV models at all, which would harm our business and our ability to grow our user base.\nLaws relating to data privacy and security, data localization, law enforcement access to data, encryption, and\nsimilar activities continue to proliferate, often with little harmonization between jurisdictions and limited\nguidance. A number of existing bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and other government bodies that contain\nprovisions that would regulate, for example, how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to\ncollect, use and share user information. The CCPA also imposes requirements on certain tracking activity. The EU\nalready has existing laws, which are due for update in 2021, requiring advertisers or companies like ours to, for\nexample, obtain unambiguous, affirmative consent from users for the placement of cookies or other tracking\ntechnologies and the delivery of relevant advertisements. If we or the third parties that we work with, such as\ncontract payment processing services, content publishers, vendors or developers violate or are alleged to violate\napplicable privacy or security laws, industry standards, our contractual obligations, or our policies, such\nviolations and alleged violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn harm our business\nand reputation and subject us to potential liability. Any of these consequences could cause our users, advertisers\nor publishers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply\nwith these laws may subject us to liability and reputational harm.\nOur use of data to deliver relevant advertising and other services on our platform places us and our content\npublishers at risk for claims under various unsettled laws, including the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).\nSome of our content publishers have been engaged in litigation over alleged violations of the VPPA relating to\nactivities on our platform in connection with advertising provided by unrelated third parties. The Federal Trade\nCommission has also in recent years revised its rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(“COPPA Rules”) broadening the applicability of the COPPA Rules, including the types of information that are\nsubject to these regulations, and it is currently examining whether additional changes are appropriate. Such\nactions could limit the information that we or our content publishers and advertisers may collect and use through\ncertain content publishers, the content of advertisements and in relation to certain channel partner content. The\nCCPA also imposes certain opt in and opt out requirements for certain information about minors. We and our content\npublishers and advertisers could be at risk for violation or alleged violation of these and other privacy,\nadvertising, or similar laws.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our\ncontrol may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as U.S. and foreign\ngovernmental regulation in the countries in which our contract manufacturer and component suppliers are located.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical\nconditions. For example, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S.\ntrade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs. For example, in November 2018, the United States, Mexico, and\nCanada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) which supersedes the North American Free Trade\nAgreement. The USMCA has been ratified by the respective legislatures of each of the three countries. Congress\napproved the USMCA in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (H.R.5430) in January 2020 (the\n“Act”), and the President signed the Act into law. The USMCA agreement entered into force on July 1, 2020, although\nthere are some remaining issues with respect to ensuring that Mexico’s and Canada’s laws and regulations to ensure\nthat both are fully in compliance with the USMCA obligations and commitments, and there may be further changes to\ninterim regulations regarding customs procedures, rules of origin, and other provisions that could affect products\nsourced from Mexico or Canada, and their eligibility for duty-free entry into the U.S., Mexican, and Canadian\nmarkets.\nThe previous U.S. Administration threatened tougher trade terms with China, the European Union, and other\ncountries, including the imposition of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $320 billion of\nimports from China. In response, China imposed higher Chinese tariffs on a large amount of U.S. exports to China,\nwhich could affect\n42\nthe prices of U.S. origin parts or components of our products assembled in China. In January 2020, the U.S. and\nChina signed a “Phase One” trade deal pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. will modify its Section 301\ntariff actions. As part of the Phase One agreement, the U.S. canceled additional Section 301 duties that were\noriginally scheduled to go into effect in December 2019 on certain imported products, including certain of our\nproducts, and reduced the duties on certain other imported products, including televisions assembled in China by\nRoku TV brand partners, from 15%ad valoremto 7.5%. While the new U.S. Administration has promised a detailed review\nof U.S. policies toward China, it is unclear what the outcomes of the review will be or whether it could lead to\nadditional U.S. tariffs, export controls, or sanctions.\nAt this time, it is unknown whether the Phase One deal will last or whether there will be sufficient progress on\nPhases Two and Three to lead to a further reduction in U.S.-China trade tensions: whether additional Section 301\ntariffs will be imposed on Roku products, imported from China and, if so, how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods\nwill remain in effect or whether even higher tariffs will be imposed, or new regulatory proposals to restrict trade\nwill be adopted. There are also pressures on the new U.S. Administration to retaliate against China over China’s\nactions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang Province, which could lead to additional U.S., Chinese and other tariffs, or a\nresumption of trade hostilities, exposing us to increased tariffs in the U.S. and Chinese markets. Finally, there\nare questions whether international trade agreements will be negotiated or existing free trade agreements re-\nnegotiated; whether new trade or tariff actions will be announced by the new Administration; or the effect that any\nsuch action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry or our business or licensees. If any new\nlegislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or terminated, or\nif tariffs are imposed on foreign-sourced or U.S. goods, it may be inefficient and expensive for us to alter our\nbusiness operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes, and higher prices could depress consumer\ndemand. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations or cash flows.\nOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Trade Representative found that Vietnam’s currency practices violate Section 301 of\nthe Trade Act of 1974 but deferred any decision whether to take any specific actions in connection with its\nfindings, leaving the decision whether to impose higher U.S. tariffs or other trade restrictions to the new U.S.\nAdministration. This decision could lead to increased tariffs on products assembled in Vietnam, but none have been\nannounced as of this time.\nIn addition, on October 2, 2020, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation\nunder Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding Vietnam’s acts, policies, and practices related to the import\nand use of illegally harvested timber. While no decision has been reached yet in this investigation, as with China,\nUSTR's Section 301 investigations of Vietnam could lead to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports from Vietnam if the\nU.S. concerns cannot be resolved through negotiations. Such tariffs may not be limited to products directly\ninvolved in the acts, policies, and practices found to violate Section 301 (e.g. tropical timber) and thus could\naffect other, unrelated products, including those sourced by us or our suppliers and licensees.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain commodities,\nsoftware, and technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could\nlimit our ability to distribute our products or collaborate on technology with our commercial or strategic\npartners, or could limit our commercial and/or strategic partners’ ability to implement our products in those\ncountries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the\nintroduction of our products in international markets, prevent our commercial and/or strategic partners with\ninternational operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of\nour products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. In particular, the U.S. government continues\nto expand export control restrictions on China and Hong Kong, which may limit the company’s ability to collaborate\nwith and transfer technology to partners in the region. Cross-border data transmissions are currently exempt from\ncustoms duties under the WTO’s temporary e-commerce moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, but\nthe moratorium faces opposition from certain WTO Members when it comes up for renewal at the WTO Ministerial\nMeeting, which was originally scheduled for June 2020. It has been postponed because of COVID-19 but may take place\nin 2021. Other potential barriers include the further proliferation of digital services taxes which potentially\ncould expose certain digital services to new taxes, U.S. or foreign sanctions or related sanctions legislation,\nincreased export and import restrictions stemming from governmental policies or U.S.-China “de-coupling,” or\nchanges in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, restrictions, and\nsanctions. Any change in export or import regulations, the imposition of customs duties or other restrictions on\nintangible goods such as cross-border data flows, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our\ndecreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or new customers in international markets or hamper\nour ability to source\n43\nproducts, components, and parts from certain suppliers. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our\nability to export, import, or sell our products, or source parts and/or components, would harm our business.\nFurther, following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom formally left the EU on January 31, 2020.\nThe effects of Brexit have been and are expected to continue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to\nits impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute\nto instability in global financial markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of\ngoods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal\nuncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws\nto replace or replicate. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain. Given these possibilities and others we may not\nanticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nThe supply chains of our contract manufacturers and many of our licensees may source products, parts or components\nfrom China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. There are many uncertainties around the COVID-19\npandemic, including scientific and health issues, the unknown duration and extent of economic disruption in China\nand other markets in the region, and the impact on the Chinese, U.S., and global economies. As a result, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may result in further supply shortages of our products or our licensees’ products, and delays in\nshipping and transportation services that negatively impact our ability or our licensees’ ability to import,\nexport, ship, or sell streaming devices to customers in U.S. and international markets. Any decrease, limitations\nor delays on our or our licensees’ ability to produce, import, export, ship, or sell our streaming devices would\nharm our business.\nUnited States or international rules that permit ISPs to limit internet data consumption by users, including\nunreasonable discrimination in the provision of broadband internet access services, could harm our business.\nLaws, regulations or court rulings that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet, including\ndecisions that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, could decrease customer demand for our\nservice offerings, may impose additional burdens on us or could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our\nbusiness model.\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted open internet rules intended to protect the ability of consumers and content\nproducers to send and receive non-harmful, lawful information on the internet, known as the Open Internet Order.\nThe Open Internet Order prohibited broadband internet access service providers from: (i) blocking access to legal\ncontent, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (ii) throttling, impairing or degrading performance based\non content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (iii) charging more for favorable delivery of\ncontent or favoring self-provisioned content over third-party content (collectively, the “prohibited activities”).\nThe Open Internet Order also prohibited broadband internet access service providers from unreasonably interfering\nwith consumers’ ability to select, access and use the lawful content, applications, services or devices of their\nchoosing as well as edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to\nconsumers.\nIn January 2018, the FCC released a new order, known as the Restoring Internet Freedom Order (the “Order”), that\nrepealed most of the blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization restrictions adopted in the Open Internet Order.\nThe Order reclassified broadband internet access service as a non-common carrier “information service” and repealed\nrules that had prohibited broadband internet access service providers from conducting the “prohibited activities”\nbut continued to require broadband internet access service providers to be transparent about their policies and\nnetwork management practices, and subjected discriminatory practices to case-by-case assessment under antitrust and\nconsumer protection laws. Most portions of the Order went into effect in April 2018 and the remainder went into\neffect in June 2018. Numerous judicial challenges to the Order were filed, and in October 2019, the Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld nearly all of the Order, but reversed the FCC's decision to\nprohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet access service, requiring case by case\ndeterminations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC's rules. The court also required the\nFCC to reexamine three issues from the Order where it found insufficient analysis but allowed the Order to remain\nin effect pending the FCC’s review. The original parties were denied a rehearing by the full U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the D.C. Circuit in February 2020 and the period to seek review by the Supreme Court has ended. On remand, the\nFCC reaffirmed its existing approach in October 2020; however, four petitioners sought reconsideration of the FCC’s\ndecision in February 2021. The FCC, now newly organized following the inauguration of President Joe Biden, has yet\nto issue a decision in response to these petitions. To the extent the courts, the agencies or the states do not\nuphold or adopt sufficient safeguards to protect against discriminatory conduct, network operators may seek to\nextract fees from us or our\n44\ncontent publishers to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory\npractices, and our business could be harmed.\nSeveral states have adopted or are considering network neutrality legislation or regulation. For example,\nCalifornia’s legislation codifies portions of the FCC’s rescinded Open Internet Order. The U.S. Department of\nJustice filed suit in September 2018 to block implementation of the California law, and the California Attorney\nGeneral agreed to delay implementation of the state law until the litigation is resolved. While the Department of\nJustice withdrew its challenge of the California net neutrality law in February 2021, the status of state net\nneutrality legislation remains uncertain because several broadband service provider trade associations also have\nsued California to invalidate its net neutrality law on grounds that the law is preempted by the Order, among other\nclaims. Several states in addition to California have enacted net neutrality legislation and several governors have\nsigned executive orders requiring broadband internet access service providers contracting with state agencies to\nadhere to network neutrality principles. The regulatory framework for network neutrality thus remains unsettled and\nis subject to ongoing federal litigation as well as federal and state legislative and regulatory activity.\nAs we expand internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access\nmay be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination\nare nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience\nanti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise harm\nour business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or\napplications could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and result in additional\nliabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nBroadband internet providers are subject to government regulation and enforcement actions, and changes in current\nor future laws, regulations or enforcement actions that negatively impact our distributors or content publishers\ncould harm our business.\nUpon the effective date of the FCC’s Restoring Internet Freedom Order, the FTC became the federal agency primarily\nresponsible for regulating broadband privacy and data security in the United States. The FTC follows an\nenforcement-focused approach to regulating broadband privacy and security. Future FTC enforcement actions could\ncause us or our content publishers to alter advertising claims or alter or eliminate certain features or\nfunctionalities of our products or services which may harm our business. At the FCC, many broadband internet\nproviders provide traditional telecommunications services that are subject to FCC and state rate regulation of\nintrastate telecommunications services, and are recipients of federal universal service fund payments, which are\nintended to subsidize telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Changes in rate regulations\nor in universal service funding rules, either at the federal or state level, could affect these broadband internet\nproviders’ revenue and capital spending plans. In addition, various international regulatory bodies have\njurisdiction over non-United States broadband internet providers. The Nevada SPI Law and the CCPA also apply to\nbroadband internet providers that do business in Nevada and California, respectively. To the extent these broadband\ninternet providers are adversely affected by laws or regulations regarding their business, products or service\nofferings, our business could be harmed.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our platform,\nour business could be harmed.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark\ninfringement, public performance royalties or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we\ndistribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of\neligible service providers for caching, hosting or linking to, user content that includes materials that infringe\ncopyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA in conducting our business. Similarly,\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”) protects online distribution platforms, such as ours,\nfrom actions taken under various laws that might otherwise impose liability on the platform provider for what\ncontent creators develop or the actions they take or inspire.\nHowever, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that rely on or may rely on in the future, in\nthe United States or international jurisdiction where we may operate, are subject to uncertain judicial\ninterpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. For example, the FCC Chair under President Trump said the\nFCC would seek comment on a petition for rulemaking filed by the National Telecommunications and Information\nAdministration that sought to limit the scope of protection provided to online distribution platforms under Section\n230. Since then, however, the acting FCC Chair appointed by President Biden has said the FCC will not seek comment\non the NTIA petition. Regulatory or legislative changes, whether in the United States or in international\njurisdictions where we may operate, may ultimately\n45\nrequire us to take a different approach towards content moderation on our platform, which could diminish the depth,\nbreadth, and variety of content we offer and, in so doing, reduce our advertising revenue or user base.\nMoreover, the DMCA and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the rules around these\nstatutes and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections or if a court\nwere to disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could incur liability and our business\ncould be harmed. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of the content that is streamed over or\nthe advertisements that are served through our platform, then our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these\nclaims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our business. Our\ninsurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may be imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we\nmay be adversely impacted if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright\ninfringement against the developers of channels that are distributed on our platform. While our platform policies\nprohibit streaming content on our platform without distribution rights from the copyright holder, and we maintain\nprocesses and systems for the reporting and removal of infringing content, in certain instances our platform has\nbeen misused by unaffiliated third parties to unlawfully distribute copyrighted content. If content owners or\ndistributors are influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are deterred from working with\nus as a consequence, this could impair our ability to maintain or expand our business, including through\ninternational expansion plans.\nOur involvement in any such legal matters now or in the future, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses\nand other costs, and be disruptive to our business.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock may be\nadversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such\ninternal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires that we furnish a report\nby management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are\nunable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is\nunable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock\nexchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require\nadditional financial and management resources.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a\nsignificant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions\ncompleted before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, we adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(“ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective\nmethod. We applied the revenue standard to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We\nrecognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance\nof retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the\naccounting standards in effect for the prior periods. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to\naccounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm our business.\n46\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the collection of sales tax and payment of income\ntaxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses,\npenalties and fees as a result of our noncompliance, which could harm our business.\nBy engaging in business activities in the United States, we become subject to various jurisdiction laws and\nregulations, including requirements to collect sales tax from our sales within those jurisdictions, and the payment\nof income taxes on revenue generated from activities in those jurisdictions. The laws and regulations governing the\ncollection of sales tax for sales on our website and payment of income taxes are numerous, complex, and vary by\njurisdiction. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we were required to collect sales or other\ntaxes or to pay income taxes where we did not could result in substantial tax liabilities, fees and expenses,\nincluding substantial interest and penalty charges, which could harm our business.\nNew legislation that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or other tax-reform\npolicies could harm our business.\nReforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for U.S. politicians, and key members of the\nlegislative and executive branches, and a wide variety of changes has been proposed or enacted. Certain changes to\nU.S. tax laws could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances\nwe maintain outside the United States. Additionally, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities\nmay increase our worldwide effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay and harm our business.\nLegislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), as modified by legislation\nenacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”),\nsignificantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act,\nalters U.S. federal tax rates, imposes additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the\nexpensing of certain capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation\nto a territorial system. Additionally, the TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act, has both positive and negative\nchanges to the utilization of future net operating loss carryforwards. For example, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in\ntaxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such\nU.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. The U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly\nimpact how we will apply the law, which could affect our financial position and result of operations. It is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA and the CARES Act.\nIn addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices\nthat impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes targeting online commerce, digital services, streaming\nservices and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption,\nvalue added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in\nliability for third-party obligations. For example, Maryland recently passed legislation establishing a tax on\ncertain advertising activities and in the EU, certain member states, and other countries have adopted or proposed\ntaxes on digital advertising and marketplace service revenue. The OECD and G-20 are currently engaged in\nnegotiations over an Inclusive Framework on “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS). The talks particularly\ntarget digital businesses, involve 135 countries, and could significantly alter the rules on international taxation\nof multinational enterprises. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional\ntaxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from\nthe failure to comply with any collection obligations. The United States has threatened to impose retaliatory\nduties under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on imports from countries that adopt DSTs, which could result in\nincreased trade tensions and potential retaliation by foreign governments against U.S. digital services or\ntechnologies.\nWe continue to examine the impact these and other tax reforms may have on our business. The impact of these and\nother tax reforms is uncertain and one or more of these or similar measures could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations and\nproceedings, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a\nway that could seriously harm our business.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to investigations and inquiries from government\nentities. These investigations and inquiries, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees, may\n47\nrequire us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other penalties or\nsanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us\nto incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business. For example, in the\npast, we responded to requests for information made by staff from the SEC.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial\npublic offering, including our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your\nability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our President\nand Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Wood, holds and controls the vote of a significant number of shares of our\noutstanding common stock, and therefore Mr. Wood will have significant influence over our management and affairs\nand over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of Roku or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Wood’s\nemployment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder\napproval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding\nshares of our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the\nholders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power\nof our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent as little as 10% of all outstanding\nshares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence\ncorporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could\nbe adversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result of such transfers, as of December 31,\n2020, Mr. Wood controls a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock even though\nhe only owns 13% of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Wood owes a fiduciary\nduty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests\nof our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Wood is entitled to vote his shares in\nhis own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. This concentrated\ncontrol could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially\nall of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the\nconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also\ndiscourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to\nthe Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for\ncompanies listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our\nClass A common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\nloss by us of key content publishers;\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our devices or platform;\nthe commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n48\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures\nor\ncapital-raising activities or commitments;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our\nfinancial performance;\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\nsales of our Class A common stock;\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to\nthe operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of such\nfluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time. Future sales and issuances of our capital\nstock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell or issue Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in\nsubsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could\ngain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common\nstock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. All of our outstanding\nClass A shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and options exercisable held by\ndirectors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act. In addition, we have reserved shares for future issuance under our equity incentive plan. Our\nemployees, other service providers, and directors are subject to our quarterly trading window, which generally\nopens at the start of the second full trading day after the public dissemination of our annual or quarterly\nfinancial results and closes (i) with respect to the first, second and third quarter of each year, at the end of\nthe fifteenth day of the last month of the such quarter and (ii) with respect to the fourth quarter of each year,\nat the end of the trading day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. These employees, service providers and\ndirectors may also sell shares during a closed window periods pursuant to trading plans that comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it\nwould be dilutive to existing stockholders and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey downgrade our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nA limited number of equity research analysts provide research coverage of our Class A common stock, and we cannot\nassure you that such equity research analysts will adequately provide research coverage of our Class A common\nstock. A lack of adequate research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Class A\ncommon stock. If securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrades our\nstock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If\none or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to publish reports on us regularly,\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n49\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In\naddition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market, may increase legal and financial\ncompliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to\nvarying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is\nprovided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws,\nregulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a\ndiversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may\ninitiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\ncould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of\nDirectors, on committees of our Board of Directors or as members of senior management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay\nany cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings to grow\nour business and for general corporate purposes. Moreover, our outstanding Credit Agreement contains prohibitions\non the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A\ncommon stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third-party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Roku, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected\nat one time;\npermitting the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly\ncreated directorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement\na stockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nreflecting our two classes of common stock as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\n50\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nand the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all\ndisputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable\njudicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nis the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws;\nor any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nTo prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings\nby different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides\nthat the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In December 2018, the Delaware Chancery\nCourt issued a ruling invalidating such provision, which we appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.\nIn March 2020, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware reversed the ruling of the Delaware Chancery Court and\nheld that the federal forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is facially valid.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In\nsuch instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum\nprovisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will\nbe enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for certain disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage\nlawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum\nprovision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an\naction, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Report. In\naddition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K,\nparticularly in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020\nand 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in\nthis Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019\nfiled with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nOverview\nWe operate in two revenue segments: the platform segment and the player segment. Platform revenue is generated from\nthe sale of digital advertising and related services, content distribution services, subscription and transaction\nrevenue shares, Premium Subscriptions, billing services, sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls and\nlicensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer revenue is generated primarily from the sale of streaming players. We expect to continue to manage the\naverage selling prices (“ASP”) of our streaming players to increase our active accounts. As a result, player\nrevenues may not increase as they have historically. We expect that the tradeoff from player gross profit to grow\nactive accounts will result in increased platform monetization and gross profit.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe widespread global impact from the outbreak and spread of the novel strain of coronavirus referred to as\nCOVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, continued through the end\nof 2020. Precautionary measures to slow down the spread of the virus that were put in place by governmental\nauthorities had eased in many locations but were re-instated in many geographies during the fourth quarter. We\ncontinue to have the majority of our workforce work from home to protect the health and safety of our employees and\ntravel has been severely curtailed.The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting precautionary measures, have caused,\nand are expected to continue to cause, economic uncertainty both in the U.S. and globally as well as significant\nvolatility in, and disruption to, financial markets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to accelerate the shift of TV viewing\naway from traditional pay TV to streaming TV resulting in a faster growth of our active accounts and an increase in\nstreaming hours. Although the growth in streaming hours per account moderated during the third quarter, streaming\nhours per account accelerated again during the fourth quarter to 17.0 billion hours. Despite advertising slowdown\nduring the second quarter that we experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the fourth quarter we had\nstrong platform revenue growth driven by advertising spend and the expansion of content distribution partnerships.\nWe believe advertising budgets will continue to shift from traditional linear TV to streaming TV and that we will\nbenefit from this shift due to our advanced advertising capabilities. Major content publishers continue to re-\norganize around streaming and as a result, our content distribution business has benefited as our rapid rate of\nactive accounts growth was accompanied by strong consumer demand for ad-supported viewing, subscription services\nand premium movie rentals. While we have experienced an increase in TV streaming during the COVID-19 pandemic and\nour business generally has generally, there can be no assurance that these patterns will continue into 2021.\nDespite the adverse impact COVID-19 pandemic has had on global supply chains, we have largely been able to maintain\ninventory of our players, audio products and accessories in stock at retailers and online stores. During the fourth\nquarter, player sales moderated due to the impact of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and ongoing economic\nuncertainty on holiday sales and consumer demand. While our player and Roku TV model sales have remained strong\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that these patterns will continue throughout the pandemic\nor beyond.\n56\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our future operations and financial performance remains uncertain, we\nare continuing to monitor our operating expenses and capital expenditures and are committed to investing in\nstrategic areas to grow our business and extend our competitive advantages.\nKey Performance Metrics\nThe key performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts\nand make strategic decisions are gross profit, active accounts, streaming hours, and ARPU.\nGross Profit\nWe use gross profit as the primary metric to measure the performance of our business because we have two revenue\nsegments that have different margin profiles, and we aim to maximize our higher margin platform revenue from our\nactive accounts as they stream content on our platform. The majority of our gross profit is generated from our\nplatform segment.\nOur gross profit was $808.2 million and $495.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nActive Accounts\nWe believe that the number of active accounts is a relevant measure to gauge the size of our user base. We define\nactive accounts as the number of distinct user accounts that have streamed content on our platform within the last\n30 days of the period. Users who streamed content from The Roku Channel only on non-Roku platforms are not included\nin this metric. The number of active accounts also does not correspond to the number of unique individuals who\nactively utilize our platform, or the number of devices associated with an account. For example, a single account\nmay be used by more than one individual, such as a family, and one account may be used on multiple streaming\ndevices.\nWe had 51.2 million and 36.9 million active accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020,\nthe fastest growing source of new accounts was licensing arrangements with our Roku TV brand partners and other\nservice operators, which collectively accounted for 62% of new accounts, up from 56% in 2019.\nHours Streamed\nWe believe the number of streaming hours on our platform is an effective measure of user engagement and that the\ngrowth in the number of hours of content streamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the\ngrowing user demand for TV streaming. We define streaming hours as the aggregate amount of time streaming devices\nstream content on our platform in a given period. Hours streamed on non-Roku platforms are not included in this\nmetric. We report streaming hours on a calendar basis.\nAdditionally, we believe that over time, increasing user engagement on our streaming platform increases our\nplatform monetization because we earn platform revenue from various forms of user engagement, including\nadvertising, revenue shares from subscriptions and transactional video on-demand. However, our revenue from content\npublishers is not tied to the hours streamed on their streaming channels, and the number of streaming hours does\nnot correlate to revenue earned from such content publishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis. Moreover,\nstreaming hours on our platform are measured whenever a Roku player or a Roku TV is streaming content, whether a\nviewer is actively watching or not. For example, if a Roku player is connected to a TV, and the viewer turns off\nthe TV, steps away or falls asleep and does not stop or pause the player, then the particular streaming channel may\nauto-play subsequent content for a period of time determined by the streaming channel. We believe that this also\noccurs across a wide variety of non-Roku streaming devices and other set-top boxes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we completed the deployment across all of our devices of a new Roku OS feature\nthat is designed to identify when content has been continuously streaming on a channel for an extended period of\ntime without user interaction. This feature, which we refer to as “Are you still watching,” periodically prompts\nthe user to confirm that they are still watching the selected channel and closes the channel if the user does not\nrespond affirmatively. We believe that the implementation of this feature across the Roku platform benefits us, our\ncustomers, channel partners and advertisers. Some of our leading channel partners, including Netflix, also have\nimplemented similar features within\n57\ntheir channels. This Roku OS feature supplements these channel features. This feature has not had and is not\nexpected to have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nWe streamed 58.7 billion and 37.8 billion hours during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote About Our Streaming Hours Adjustments\nTo calculate and report our streaming hours, we utilize data from event logs generated by the firmware running on\nthe Roku devices that are recorded in a central database. The event information (play, pause, stop, time counts,\netc.) is generated by the firmware running on the Roku streaming devices, and event data is transmitted to our\ncentral database at regular intervals when a device is connected to the internet. Pause time is not intended to be\nincluded in streaming hours.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020 we discovered that some pause time was inadvertently included in the streaming\nhours information recorded in our central database. Upon discovering these errors in the log data, we promptly\nreviewed and analyzed the issue utilizing our firmware, data engineering and core analytics teams. We concluded\nthat certain past Roku OS releases inadvertently caused the logging errors. The error rates varied over time and\nacross different types of devices and firmware versions. As a result, we reported higher streaming hours and\nstreaming hours growth rates for the affected periods than we would have if all pause time had been excluded from\nstreaming hours as we had intended. Neither these logging errors, nor the resulting adjustments that we made to our\nstreaming hours calculations, has had any impact on our financial results, and do not require us to revise any of\nour previously reported key operating metrics other than streaming hours.\nThe affected log data was for the periods from February 2016 to August 2020. After adjusting for logging errors, we\nestimate that our streaming hours were, on average, approximately 0.5% lower than previously reported for the\nperiod January 2017 through September 2018, and approximately 5.8% lower for the period October 2018 through March\n2020.\nBy the end of August 2020, we fully deployed a software update that addressed the root cause of the pause time\nlogging errors and prevented them from continuing.\nThe roll out of the “Are you still watching” feature had no impact on the adjustments we made to our streaming\nhours calculations. While our revenue from content publishers is not based on the hours streamed on their streaming\nchannels, and the number of streaming hours does not directly correlate to revenue earned from such content\npublishers or ARPU on a period-by-period basis; we believe that the growth in the number of hours of content\nstreamed across our platform reflects our success in addressing the growing user demand for TV streaming. After\nadjusting our streaming hours as discussed above, our estimated year-over-year streaming hour growth rates for\nfiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018 and the first quarter of 2020\nversus the first quarter of 2019 were 60.5%, 59.3% and 46.8%, respectively. The estimated year-over-year streaming\nhour growth rate for the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019 was 65%.\nThe following table presents the estimated impacts on streaming hours (in billions) for periods from January 1,\n2017 through March 31, 2020 and streaming hours growth rates on a year-over-year (“YoY”) basis by quarter for\nperiods from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2020 and annually for fiscal year 2018 and 2019. Revised streaming\nhours for 2016 are not estimated and therefore revised 2017 YoY growth rates are not available.\n58\nQuarter  Published SHs  Revised SHs  SHs % Delta  Published YoY  Revised YoY\n2017 Q1  3.3B           3.2B         -0.5%        63.4%          NA\n2017 Q2  3.5B           3.5B         -0.4%        60.0%          NA\n2017 Q3  3.8B           3.8B         -0.4%        57.8%          NA\n2017 Q4  4.3B           4.3B         -0.2%        55.3%          NA\n2018 Q1  5.1B           5.1B         -0.5%        56.0%          56.1%\n2018 Q2  5.5B           5.4B         -0.5%        57.2%          57.0%\n2018 Q3  6.2B           6.1B         -0.7%        62.7%          62.1%\n2018 Q4  7.3B           7.1B         -2.2%        68.6%          65.2%\n2019 Q1  8.9B           8.4B         -5.4%        74.1%          65.5%\n2019 Q2  9.4B           8.8B         -6.0%        72.1%          62.6%\n2019 Q3  10.3B          9.6B         -6.5%        67.6%          57.9%\n2019 Q4  11.7B          10.9B        -6.3%        60.2%          53.7%\n2020 Q1  13.2B          12.3B        -7.0%        49.3%          46.8%\nYear     Published SHs  Revised SHs  SHs % Delta  Published YoY  Revised YoY\n2017     14.8B          14.8B        -0.4%        58.8%          NA\n2018     24.0B          23.7B        -1.1%        61.7%          60.5%\n2019     40.3B          37.8B        -6.1%        67.8%          59.3%\nAverage Revenue per User\nWe measure our platform monetization progress with ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our\nbusiness. We define ARPU as our platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the\nnumber of active accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the corresponding period in the prior\nyear. ARPU measures the rate at which we are monetizing our active account base and the progress of our platform\nbusiness.\nARPU was $28.76 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $23.14 as of December 31, 2019.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nRate of TV streaming and advertising shift to OTT\nConsumers have significantly shifted their TV viewing behavior, and we believe that someday all TV content will be\nstreamed. We also believe this presents a large market opportunity for digital advertising. This shift in viewing\nbehavior is a critical component of our business model because our platform revenue and player revenue, as well as\nour overall expense structure, is dependent on this shift. In addition, the number of hours streamed on our\nplatform is a critical element of our business because user engagement with our platform generates our advertising\ninventory and determines our advertising sell through.\nUser acquisition strategy\nWe acquire users through three primary ways: our TV brand partners sell Roku TVs through our Roku TV licensing\nprogram, we sell streaming players, and we have licensing relationships with service operators. We monetize our\nuser base through platform revenue. Player revenue and player gross profit have decreased, and may continue to\ndecrease, over time as we strategically aim to acquire new users through the sale of lower priced streaming\nplayers.\nAbility to monetize users and streaming hours\nOur business model is to increase both active accounts and streaming hours while growing revenue and gross profit\nthrough the monetization of our streaming platform. We believe we have a significant opportunity to grow platform\nrevenue as we further monetize our users’ engagement. Our platform makes it easy for content publishers to\ndistribute and monetize their streaming content through three primary business models: transaction video on demand\n(“TVOD”) that includes channels that offer a la carte movie purchases or rentals, subscription video on demand\n(“SVOD”) that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand channels and so-called virtual multichannel\nvideo programming distribution services, and advertising supported video on demand (“AVOD”) that includes channels\nthat do not charge a subscription\n59\nfee to users. We generate revenue from TVOD and SVOD channels from various forms of revenue sharing arrangements.\nOur revenue sharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services\nand to movie rentals or purchases for TVOD. Through our platform we also are able to offer content partners with\nbilling services which support in-channel purchases including movie purchases, rentals, and subscriptions.\nRevenue from the distribution of AVOD channels is generated through the sale of advertising within the channel. We\nare increasing the monetization of these streaming hours by expanding our advertising capabilities both on and off\nour platform. We intend to continue to leverage our data and analytics to deliver relevant advertising and improve\nthe ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure their results. We also plan to continue to\nexpand our direct sales teams to increase the number of advertisers who use our services. The Roku Channel offers\nfree, ad-supported access for users to a selection of films, television series and other content. The Roku Channel\nis a source of digital advertising inventory under our control and is another way that we connect content\npublishers with users. The Roku Channel provides customers with free access to over 50,000 titles, including hit\nHollywood movies, TV episodes, news channels and more and is rapidly becoming one of our leading sources of\nadvertising inventory. In January 2019, we launched Premium Subscriptions within The Roku Channel, through which we\nresell ad-free premium content subscription services from providers such as Showtime, Starz, and Epix.\nContinued investment in growth\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on the success of the investments in our business that we have\nmade, and will continue to make, to improve the value for users, content publishers and advertisers on our\nplatform. We must regularly update and enrich our platform to meet evolving consumer behavior and deliver a\nsuperior experience for our users, content publishers and advertisers. Further, it is important that we remain a\nplatform for content delivery and invest to provide content publishers with best-in-class publishing tools and\nactionable audience insights. We must continue to innovate and invest in our advertising capabilities and\ntechnology so that we attract and encourage incremental advertising spend on our platform. Accordingly, we plan to\ncontinue investing in our business to enhance our competitive differentiation and seed future growth. In\nparticular, these investments will include: Research and Development initiatives to bring new features, technology,\nand content to our platform; Sales and Marketing efforts to drive increased scale and engagement of our user base;\nand building out our General and Administrative infrastructure to support a global scale business.\nSeasonality\nIn the fourth quarter of each calendar year, we generally generate significantly higher levels of revenue and gross\nprofit from platform segment revenue and significantly higher levels of player segment revenue. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, fourth quarter revenue comprised 37% and 36% of our total net revenue, respectively,\nand fourth quarter gross profit comprised 38% and 33% of our total gross profit, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPlatform Revenue\nWe generate platform revenue from advertising sales and related services, subscription and transaction revenue\nsharing arrangements with partners, the sale of Premium Subscription services, sales of branded channel buttons on\nremote controls and licensing arrangements with service operators. Our first-party video ad inventory includes The\nRoku Channel, native display ads on our home screen and screen saver as well as ad inventory we obtain through our\ncontent distribution agreements with publishers. To supplement supply, we re-sell video inventory that we purchase\nfrom content publishers and, to a lesser extent, directly sell third-party inventory on a revenue share basis. To\ndate, we have generated most of our platform revenue in the United States.\nPlayer Revenue\nWe generate player revenue primarily from the sale of streaming players through consumer retail distribution\nchannels, including major brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and Walmart, and online retailers, including\nAmazon. We generate most of our player revenue in the United States. In our international markets, we primarily\nsell our\n60\nplayers through wholesale distributors which, in turn, re-sell to retailers. We currently distribute our players in\nCanada, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Mexico, Brazil and several other Latin American\ncountries.\nPlayer revenue also includes the sale of our audio products, including wireless speakers, smart soundbars and\nwireless subwoofers.\nCost ofRevenue\nCost of Platform Revenue\nCost of platform revenue consists of costs associated with arrangements with content partners and publishers\nincluding advertising inventory and content or programming licensing fees. Cost of platform revenue also includes\npayment processing fees, allocated expenses associated with the delivery of our services including salaries,\nbenefits and stock-based compensation for our operations and support teams, third-party cloud services and\namortization of acquired technology.\nCost of Player Revenue\nCost of player revenue is comprised mostly of player manufacturing costs payable to our third-party contract\nmanufacturer and technology licenses or royalty fees. Cost of player revenue also includes inbound and outbound\nfreight, duty and logistics costs, third-party packaging and allocated overhead costs related to facilities and\ncustomer support, and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for operations personnel.\nOperating and Other Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and\nstock-based compensation for our development teams as well as outsourced development fees. In addition, research\nand development expenses include allocated facilities and overhead costs. We expect research and development\nexpenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform, player and TV\nproducts, advertising products and other platform services.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits,\ncommissions and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales and sales support, marketing,\ncommunications, data science and analytics, business development, product management and partner and customer\nsupport functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include marketing, retail and merchandising costs and\nallocated facilities and overhead expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars\nin future periods as we focus on growing active accounts, platform and player revenues, and expanding our business\ninternationally.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our\nexecutive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative personnel. General and\nadministrative expenses also include outside legal, accounting and other professional service fees as well as\nallocated facility expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the expansion of\nour business and related infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other income (expense), net consists of interest income on cash and cash\nequivalents, interest expense that primarily includes interest on our Credit Facility (as defined in ‘Liquidity and\nCapital Resources’ below) and amortization of deferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement and transaction\ngains and losses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,other income (expense), net consists of interest\nincome on short-term investments and cash balances, interest expense that primarily includes amortization of\ndeferred debt costs, foreign currency re-measurement and transaction gains and losses.\n61\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nOur income tax (benefit) expense consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business and state income taxes in the United States. We have a valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax\nassets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development.\nWe expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue\nfor each of the periods indicated.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020        2019        2018\nNet Revenue:\nPlatform                                                 71  %       66  %       56  %\nPlayer                                                   29  %       34  %       44  %\nTotal net revenue                                       100  %      100  %      100  %\nCost of Revenue:\nPlatform                                                 28  %       23  %       16  %\nPlayer                                                   27  %       33  %       39  %\nTotal cost of revenue                                    55  %       56  %       55  %\nGross Profit:\nPlatform                                                 43  %       43  %       40  %\nPlayer                                                    2  %        1  %        5  %\nTotal gross profit                                       45  %       44  %       45  %\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development                                 20  %       24  %       23  %\nSales and marketing                                      17  %       16  %       14  %\nGeneral and administrative                               10  %       10  %       10  %\nTotal operating expenses                                 47  %       50  %       47  %\nLoss from Operations                                     (2  )%      (6  )%      (2  )%\nOther Income, Net:\nOther income, net                                         —  %        1  %        1  %\nTotal other income, net                                   —  %        1  %        1  %\nLoss before income taxes                                 (2  )%      (5  )%      (1  )%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense                              —  %        —  %        —  %\nNet loss attributable to common                          (2  )%      (5  )%      (1  )%\nstockholders\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet Revenue\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)                           2020            2019       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                 1,267,744    $    740,776    $   526,968          71  %\nPlayer                                                    510,644         388,145        122,499          32  %\nTotal Net Revenue                     $                 1,778,388    $  1,128,921    $   649,467          58  %\nPlatform\nPlatform revenue increased by $527.0 million, or 71%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2019. The increase is mostly attributable to higher advertising revenues, including revenue from\n62\nour demand-side platform, which we acquired fromdataxuin November 2019. In 2020,were-brandedour demand-side\nplatformas the OneView Ad Platform and integrateditwith Roku-native identity, data and attribution tools.

During the year ended December 31, 2020,the\nvolume of streaming players sold increased 28% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 offset by a 3%\ndecrease in the average selling price of players. The increase in the volume of players sold was due to an increase\nin demand for lower priced models, namely the Roku Express player and the Roku Premiere player, and in part to\nconsumers spending more time at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCost of Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)       Years Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue:                                             2020          2019       Change $    Change %\nPlatform                              $                   503,177    $  262,655    $   240,522          92  %\nPlayer                                                    466,992       371,042         95,950          26  %\nTotal Cost of Revenue                 $                   970,169    $  633,697    $   336,472          53  %\nGross profit:\nPlatform                              $                   764,567    $  478,121    $   286,446          60  %\nPlayer                                                     43,652        17,103         26,549         155  %\nTotal Gross Profit                    $                   808,219    $  495,224    $   312,995          63  %\nPlatform\nThe cost of platform revenue increased by $240.5 million, or 92%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related\ncosts of $29.2 millionrelated to increased headcount of 27% and related stock-based compensation, an increase of\n$16.1 million related to higher legal, consulting and professional service fees, an increase of $5.1 million\nrelated to higher facilities costs, an increase of $3.1 million in allowance for doubtful accounts primarily from\nadoption of accounting standard for credit losses, and a net increase of $3.3 million that includes various\ncorporate expenses and overheads partly offset by a decrease in travel expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Income (Expenses), Net\n(in thousands, except             Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                                          2020            2019          Change $       Change %\nInterest expense               $                    (3,432  )    $  (2,366  )    $  (1,066    )          45  %\nOther income (expense), net                          5,233           6,506          (1,273    )         (20  )%\nTotal Other Income             $                     1,801       $   4,140       $  (2,339    )         (56  )%\n(Expense), Net\n64\nOther income (expenses), net\nTotal other income (expense), net, decreased by $2.3 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2019.Interest expense, including amortization of deferred debt costs, was higher for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher level of borrowings under our Credit Facility as compared to the\nprior year. Other income, net was $1.3 million lower in the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income declined\n$2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a significant drop in interest rates early in the year in\nreaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our investment yields. This was offset by favorable foreign\nexchange totaling $1.4 million primarily related to the British Pound.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expenses\n(in thousands, except                  Years Ended December 31,\npercentages)                           2020                              2019          Change $    Change %\nIncome tax (benefit) expense        $  (945                      )    $  (982  )    $        37    (4        )%\nIncome tax benefit\nIncome tax benefit arises from foreign income taxes and state income taxes in the United States.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,092.8 million. Approximately 1.2% of our cash was\nheld outside the United States in accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries which are used to fund foreign\noperations.\nOur primary sources of cash are receipts from platform and player revenue and proceeds from equity sales including\nequity issued pursuant to our employee stock option plans. The primary uses of cash are costs of revenue including\nthird party manufacturing costs, costs to acquire advertising inventory, and content and programming license fees\nas well as operating expenses including payroll-related expenses, consulting and professional service fees, and\nfacility and marketing expenses. Other uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment.\nWe have multi-year lease agreements for office space and incurred material expenses in 2020. We expect to continue\nto incur material expenses for facility and building related costs forour campus headquarters in San Jose,\nCalifornia as well as at other office locations in the U.S. and internationally. As our business and workforce\ncontinue to expand, we further expect ongoing purchases of computer systems and other investments in property and\nequipment. In addition, we may pursue merger and acquisition activities, including the acquisition of rights to\nprogramming and content assets that could materially impact our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and our undrawn available balance\nunder our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths. Our future capital requirements, the adequacy of available funds, and cash flows from operations could be\naffected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk\nFactors and the effects of the COVD-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has not severely impacted our liquidity and\ncapital resources to date, it has contributed to disruption and volatility in local economies and in capital and\ncredit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\nWe may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Our\nCredit Agreement expires in February 2023. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, we may be subject to fixed payment obligations and also to restrictive covenants.\n65\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn May 13, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of our Class\nA common stock and received gross proceeds of $504.0 millionat an average selling price of $126.01 per share and\nincurred issuance costs of $6.8 million.\nSenior Secured Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019 (the “Original Closing Date”), we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Existing Credit\nAgreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. On May 3, 2019, (the “Closing Date”), the Existing Credit\nAgreement was amended pursuant to an Incremental Assumption and Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment” and the Existing\nCredit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”).\nThe Credit Agreement provides for (i) a four-year revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up\nto $100.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) a four-year delayed draw term loan A facility in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”) and (iii) an uncommitted\nincremental facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and other conditions, in the amount of up to\n(v) $50.0 million, plus (w) 1.0x of our consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter\nperiod, plus (x) an additional amount at our discretion, so long as, on a pro forma basis at the time of\nincurrence, our secured leverage ratio does not exceed 1.50 to 1.00, plus (y) voluntary prepayments of the\nRevolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility to the extent accompanied by concurrent reductions to the\napplicable Credit Facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility, collectively,\nthe “Credit Facility”).\nFor our current borrowings, we have elected a Eurodollar borrowing with interest at a rate equal to the adjusted\none-month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% based on our secured leverage ratio. The borrowings under\nthe facility mature or have to repaid in full by February 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are\nsecured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, a financial covenant that is tested quarterly and requires us to\nmaintain a certain adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00, and customary events of default.As of December\n31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. See Note 10 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements in Item 8 of this Report, for additional details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $30.8 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, respectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows         Years Ended December 31,\nData:                                                             2020              2019\nCash flows provided by operating           $                   148,192       $    13,707\nactivities\nCash flows used in investing activities                        (81,324  )       (110,295  )\nCash flows provided by financing                               509,048           458,328\nactivities\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash of $148.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss of\n$17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $225.7 million comprising\nmainly of $134.1 million of stock-based compensation, $36.2 million of depreciation and amortization primarily on\nproperty and equipment and acquired intangible assets, $28.7 million of amortization of operating lease right-of-\nuse assets, $22.4 million of amortization of capitalized licensed content assets and $3.8 million of provision for\ndoubtful accounts. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities used cash of $60.0 million comprised\nofoutflows of $196.0 million from an increase in accounts receivableprimarily driven by higher sales volume in the\nlast quarter, $4.2 million from increased inventory levels\n66\nat the end of the year, $3.5 million from an increase in prepaid and other current assetsdue to an increase in\ncontract assets, prepaid taxes and other general expenses, and $1.1 million from an increase in other long term\nassets. These outflows were offset by cash inflows by an increase of $103.2 million from an increase in accrued\nliabilitiesrelated to content publisher payables,marketing, retail and merchandising costs, advertising inventory\ncostsand overall growth in the volume of business,$21.5 million from an increase in deferred revenue due to overall\ngrowth in the volume of business,$13.0 million from an increase in operating lease liabilities for new leases added\nduring the year, $6.4 million from an increase in accounts payable, and $0.6 million from an increase in other\nlong-term liabilities.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss of $59.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019 was adjusted by non-cash charges of $127.9 million comprising mainly\nof $85.2 million of stock-based compensation and $15.7 million of depreciation and amortization primarily on\nproperty and equipment and acquired intangible assets, $22.3 million of amortization of operating right-of-use\nassets and $2.9 million of amortization of capitalized licensed content assets. The changes in our operating assets\nand liabilities used cash of $54.2 million comprised of outflows of $110.2 million from an increase in accounts\nreceivable due to increased seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter, $14.1 million from increasing inventory\nlevels, $10.6 million from a decrease in deferred revenue, $9.9 million from an increase in prepaid and other\ncurrent assets due to an increasein prepaid contracts, marketing expenses and prepaid capital expenditure for new\nfacilities, $3.0 million from a decrease in other long-term liabilities, and $3.0 million from an increase in other\nlong-term assets. These outflows were offset by cash inflows of $74.5 million from an increase in accrued\nliabilities due to timing of payments, increased content publishers payables, and overall growth in the volume of\nbusiness,$11.7 million from an increase in operating lease liabilities, $9.4 million from an increase in accounts\npayable, and $1.1 million from a decrease in deferred cost of revenue.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities used cash of $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash used comprised\nof $82.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment, which primarily related to expenditures on leasehold\nimprovements related to expanding our facilities and other capital investments, partially offset by $1.1 million of\ncash received from proceeds from the resolution of purchase acquisition contingencies.\nOur investing activities used cash of $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash used comprised\nof $77.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, which primarily related to expenditures on leasehold\nimprovements related to expanding our facilities and other capital investments, $68.1 million related to the\nacquisition of dataxu, Inc., $12.4 million spent on the purchase of short-term investments, and $7.4 million\nrelated to the purchases of other intangible assets, partially offset by $54.8 million received from\nsales/maturities of short-term investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities provided cash of $509.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash was\nreceived mainly from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our at-the-market offering amounting to\n$497.2 million, net of offering costs and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $16.8 million. We\nborrowed and repaid $69.3 million of our Revolving Credit Facility in addition to the repayments of $5.0 million on\nour Term Loan A during the year.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $458.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash was\nreceived mainly from net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock through our at-the-market offerings\namounting to $330.5 million, net of offering costs, proceeds from borrowings amounting to $99.6 million, net of\nissuance costs, and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $28.2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as defined by\napplicable SEC rules and regulations.\n67\nContractual Obligations\nOur future minimum payments under our non-cancelable contractual obligations were as follows as of December 31,\n2020 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period       Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\nTotal          1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nTerm Loan A Facility       $                  95,000    $      5,000    $   90,000    $       —    $          —\n(1)\nPurchase commitments                         185,945         185,945             —            —               —\n(2)\nOperating lease                              440,645          50,889        94,974       92,930         201,852\nobligations (3)\nOther obligations (4)                         70,990          42,574        26,376        2,040               —\nTotal                      $                 792,580    $    284,408    $  211,350    $  94,970    $    201,852\nRepresents the principal amount of Term Loan A Facility.

Consistent with\nindustry practices, we enter into firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments to acquire products\nthrough a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand\ninformation. Our contract manufacturer sources components and builds our products based on these demand forecasts.\nChanges to projected demand or in the subsequent sales mix of our products, may result in us being committed to\npurchase excess inventory to satisfy these commitments.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in\nthe table above.\nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits, net, the table does not include $29.2 million of such non-current liabilities not included in our\nconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions\nare affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic\nenvironment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations may require significant\njudgment.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation.\nFor performance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales.\nFor those\n68\nperformance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, we determine SSP using information that may include\nmarket conditions and other observable inputs.\nTo the extent platform services are part of multiple element arrangement, revenue recognition of each performance\nobligation in the estimated transaction price of a contract is based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control\nof the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as\nthe party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nOur player revenue includes allowances for returns and sales incentives in the estimated transaction price. The\nestimates for returns and sales incentives are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. We\nprovide unspecified upgrades and updates to our player end users. We record the allocated value of these as\ndeferred revenue and recognize it ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the\nassociated players. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at\nfair value on the date of acquisition. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\nthe useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\nintangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and\noutflows, expected technology life cycle, attrition rates of customers, and discount rates. We estimate the useful\nlives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit\nfrom the asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately\nvalue assets and liabilities acquired, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a\nresult, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments\nto the assets and liabilities acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent we identify\nadjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the values of assets and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments\nare recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when specific\ncircumstances dictate, between annual tests. We measure recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level. The\nprocess of determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly subjective and involves the use of significant\nestimates and assumptions. In performing our annual assessment, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to\ntest a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on our\nqualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is, more likely than not, less\nthan its carrying amount, then the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit's\ncarrying amount over its fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss.\nWe identify intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determine their fair value. The determination\ninvolves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an\nasset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate discount weighted-average cost of capital. We\namortize purchased-intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We\nreview purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is\nshorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such\nfacts and circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of\npurchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected\n69\nundiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset group against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment,\nif any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of these asset groups. If the useful life\nof the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the\nremaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nAllowances for Sales Returns, Sales Incentives and Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives and\ndoubtful accounts which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts\nreceivable. We perform an ongoing analysis of various factors including our historical experience, promotional\nprograms, claims to date and other business factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales\nincentives.\nWe assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist\nand on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with collectability issues and determine the\nallowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering historical collectability based\non past due status, credit quality, and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing\ncredit evaluations. We consider customer-specific information and current economic conditions that may affect a\ncustomer’s ability to pay.\nIf our estimates regarding accounts receivable allowances differ from the actual results, the losses or gains,\ncould be material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized\nas an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of\nthe respective award. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment.\nWe account for the fair value of restricted stock units using the closing market price of our Class A common stock\non the date of the grant.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of\nthe grant date fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock\nfair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables\ninclude our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and\ncancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. We use the closing market price for our Class A common stock as reported on\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the\nstock options are expected to remain outstanding. To determine the expected term, we generally apply the\nsimplified approach in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the\nvesting date and the expiration date of the award as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to\nprovide a reasonable basis for an estimate of expected term.\nVolatility. As we do not have sufficient trading history for our Class A common stock, the expected\nvolatility for our Class A common stock is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for\nindustry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock\noption awards. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar\nin size, stage of life cycle or financial leverage. We intend to consistently apply this process until a\nsufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own Class A common stock share\nprice becomes available or unless circumstances change such that the identified peer companies are no longer\nsimilar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are available would be utilized in\nthe calculation.\nRisk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with\nmaturities similar to the expected term for each of our stock options.\n70\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes\nsignificantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted\npreviously.\nWe will continue to use judgement in evaluating assumptions related to our stock-based compensation cost. As we\ncontinue to accumulate additional data related to our Class A common stock and our business evolves, we may have\nrefinements to our assumptions and estimates which could impact our future stock-based compensation cost.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and\nliability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the\ndifference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthe differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation\nallowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have\nestablished a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of\nrealizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our\nvaluation allowance is attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating\nlosses and other deferred tax assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2020 and those not yet adopted are\ndiscussed and included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to the interest income generated by cash, cash equivalents and interest\nexpense on the Credit Facility. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while\nmaximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest\nrates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility totaled $95.0 million with an effective interest rate\nof 2.03%. If the amount outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility remains at this level for an entire year and\ninterest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease,\nrespectively, by an additional $1.0 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nMost of our revenue is generated within the United States and we have minimal foreign currency risk related to our\nrevenue. In addition, most of our operating expenses are denominated in the U.S. dollar, resulting in minimal\nforeign currency risks. In the future, if our international revenues increase or more of our expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely be more\nsignificant. For any of the periods presented, we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts. However, in\nthe future, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\n71",

In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in\nfiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the\noptional transition method.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit\nof the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that\n(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

For transactional revenue sharing arrangements, the estimate of the variable consideration is based on\nmanagement’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted performance of the publisher’s content\napplication(s). For the sale of branded channel buttons on remote controls, the estimate of the variable\nconsideration is based on management’s assessment of historical, current, and forecasted player and Roku TV sales\nvolumes.\nWe identified the revenue forecasts relating to content publisher arrangements as a critical audit matter due to\nthe significant judgment necessary to estimate variable consideration and transaction prices. Such estimates\nrequired a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort relative to evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of variable consideration.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s forecast used in the determination of future variable consideration\nincluded the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s forecasting process related to content\ndistribution services and branded channel buttons.\nWe selected a sample of revenue arrangements with variable consideration and performed the following:\no  Obtained contractual documents for each selection, including master agreements and other related documents.\nAnalyzed the contractual documents to determine if all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue\no  recognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contract,\nincluding terms and conditions for revenue sharing.\no  Performed inquiries with applicable individuals in the Company’s finance and sales departments regarding the\nestimates for sales of branded channel buttons.\no  Evaluated management’s accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecasts of consideration to\nactual consideration received.\no  Evaluated changes from prior period forecasts to current period forecasts, when applicable.\no  Compared management’s forecasts of variable consideration to historical data, other information within the\nCompany, and certain publicly available historical and forecasted industry information, when applicable.\nTested the mathematical accuracy of the compilation of the forecast.The critical audit matter communicated\nbelow is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\no  material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments.

THE COMPANY\nOrganization and Description of Business\nRoku, Inc. (the “Company” or “Roku”), was formed in October 2002 as Roku LLC under the laws of the State of\nDelaware. On , Roku LLC was converted into Roku, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Company’s TV streaming platform\nallows users to easily discover and access a wide variety of movies and TV episodes, as well as live sports, music,\nnews and more. The Company operates in reportable segments and generates platform revenue from advertising, content\ndistribution, audience development, billing services and licensing activities and player revenue from the sale of\nstreaming players and audio products.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Roku, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nhave been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior period amounts within cash flow from operations in the statement of cash flows, have been\nreclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net cash provided\nby operating activities for any period reported.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgements, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net\nrevenue and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition,\ndetermining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable consideration, determining\nthe stand-alone selling prices of performance obligations, gross versus net revenue recognition, evaluation of\ncustomer versus vendor relationships, and other obligations such as sales return reserves and sales incentive\nprograms; the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; useful lives of tangible and intangible assets;\nallowances for doubtful accounts; the valuation of deferred income tax assets; and stock-based compensation. The\nCompany bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates and assumptions.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe comprehensive loss is equal to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. Comprehensive loss includes\nunrealized gains on the Company’s short-term investments and foreign currency translation adjustments for the year\nended December 31, 2019. Comprehensive loss includes unrealized losses on the Company’s short-term investments for\nthe year ended December 31, 2018. Income taxes on the unrealized gains or losses are not material.\n81\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities\nof these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in effect at period-end and\nnonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at\naverage exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency gains or losses from re-measurement and\ntransaction gains or losses are recorded as other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\noperations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $ million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $ million and $\nmillion, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to\nbe cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, financial institutions managed % and %, respectively, of the\nCompany’s total cash and cash equivalents balance. As of December 31, 2019, the same financial institutions managed\n% and %, respectively, of the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents balance.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. They are stated at\ninvoice value less estimated allowances for sales returns, sales incentives and doubtful accounts. The Company\nperforms ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses and\ndoubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, ongoing promotional activities, historical claim\nrate and other factors to determine the allowances for sales returns and sales incentives.\nAllowance for Sales Returns: Allowance for sales returns consist of the following activities (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020             2019             2018\nBeginning balance                      $                    (6,550  )    $   (7,335  )    $   (6,907  )\nCharged to revenue                                         (14,594  )       (15,541  )       (17,396  )\nUtilization of sales return reserve                         15,232           16,326           16,968\nEnding balance                         $                    (5,912  )    $   (6,550  )    $   (7,335  )\nAllowance for Sales Incentives: Allowance for sales incentives consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020             2019             2018\nBeginning balance                         $                   (19,476  )    $  (13,750  )    $  (10,442  )\nCharged to revenue                                            (68,315  )       (65,676  )       (50,958  )\nUtilization of sales incentive reserve                         56,953           59,950           47,650\nEnding balance                            $                   (30,838  )    $  (19,476  )    $  (13,750  )\n82\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: Allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following activities (in\nthousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020            2019          2018\nBalance, beginning of period              $                    (1,140  )         (686  )        (63  )\nImpact of adoption of ASU 2016-13                              (1,066  )            —             —\nAdjusted balance, beginning of period                          (2,206  )         (686  )        (63  )\nProvision for doubtful accounts           $                    (3,801  )    $    (704  )    $  (876  )\nAdjustments for recovery and write-off                          1,826             250           253\nBalance, end of period                                         (4,181  )       (1,140  )       (686  )\nCustomer H accounted for % of the accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2020. The Company did t have\nany customer that accounted for more than 10% of its accounts receivable, net balance as of December 31, 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company determines whether a transaction meets the definition of a business combination before applying the\nacquisition method of accounting to that transaction. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase\nconsideration of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The operating results of acquired business is included\nin the Company’s consolidated statement of operations beginning on their effective acquisition date. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and other related charges are recognized separately from the\nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred. Contingent consideration arrangements are recognized at fair\nvalue as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in operations.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during\nthe measurement period, which may be up to from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax\npositions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as\nof the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and\nassumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that\nthe Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination\nof the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are recorded at their fair values upon acquisition close.\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company\nevaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets annually and when events or changes in\ncircumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nImpairment Assessments\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. This includes but is not\nlimited to significant adverse changes in the business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In\nperforming its annual assessment, the Company can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting\nunit’s goodwill for impairment or it can directly perform a quantitative assessment. Based on the Company’s\nqualitative assessment, if\n83\nit is determined that the fair value of our reporting unit is, more likely than not, less thanitscarrying amount,\nthen the quantitative assessment is performed. Any excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair\nvalue is be recorded as an impairment loss.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, intangible assets and capitalized licensed content assets with finite lives\nfor impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. The Company assesses\nthese assets for impairment based on their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the\nasset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based\non the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.\nThe Company did t recognize any impairment for goodwill, intangible assets or capitalized licensed content assets\nin any periods reported. The impairments of operating right-of-use assets during the years ended December 31, 2020\nand 2019 were not material.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s\ncontracts include various product or services or a combination of both, which are generally capable of being\ndistinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company’s contracts often contain multiple\ndistinct performance obligations.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price of a contract based on the expected value for which a significant\nreversal of revenue is not expected to occur. The estimate of the variable consideration is based on the assessment\nof historical, current, and forecasted performance noted and expected from the performance obligation.\nIn arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the estimated transaction price of each contract is\nallocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). For\nperformance obligations routinely sold separately, the SSP is determined by evaluating such stand-alone sales. For\nthose performance obligations that are not routinely sold separately, the Company determines SSP based on market\nconditions and other observable inputs.\nWhen the Company sells third-party goods and services, it evaluates whether the Company is the principal, and\nreports revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and reports revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, the\nCompany considers if it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and\ndiscretion in establishing price.\nRevenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to the relevant\ngovernment authority. The Company does not capitalize any cost associated with contract acquisition because it\napplies a practical expedient and expenses commissions when incurred as most direct contract acquisition costs\nrelate to contracts that are recognized over a period of one year or less. Sales commissions are included in Sales\nand marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As-invoiced practical expedient is applied\nwhen the amount of consideration the Company has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\nNature of Products and Services\nPlatform segment:\nThe Company generates platform revenue from the sale of digital advertising and related services, content\ndistribution services, subscription and transaction revenue shares, Premium Subscriptions, billing services, sale\nof branded channel buttons on remote controls and licensing arrangements with service operators and TV brands.\n84\nThe Company sells digital advertising directly to marketers or through advertising agencies. Revenue from\nadvertising is mostly generated through video and display advertising delivered through advertising impressions.\nAdvertising is typically sold on a cost-per-thousand (“CPM”) basis and is evidenced by an Insertion Order (“IO”).\nRevenue is recognized as the number of impressions are delivered. IOs may include multiple performance obligations\nas they contain distinct advertising products or services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to\neach distinct performance obligation based on their relative SSP. The Company also generates revenue from customers\nusing its platform. For that it charges a platform fee, which is a percentage of a customer’s advertising inventory\nspend during the month, along with data and any add-on features purchased through the platform. The Company\nrecognizes revenue on either a gross or net basis for digital advertising based on its determination as to whether\nit is acting as the principal in the revenue generation process or as an agent. Where the Company is the principal,\nit controls the advertising inventory before it is transferred to its customers. This is further supported by the\nCompany being primarily responsible to its customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nAdvertising arrangements comprised of multiple performance obligations are recognized either at a point in time or\nover time depending on the nature of the distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company’s content distribution revenue sharing arrangements include cash or non-cash consideration. The revenue\nsharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the\ntime of a movie rental or purchase. Revenue is recognized on a net basis as the Company is deemed to be the agent\nbetween content publishers and end users. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, as the services\nare delivered over the contractual distribution term. Non-cash consideration is usually in the form of advertising\ninventory, the fair value of which is determined based on relevant internal and third-party data.\nThe Company sells monthly subscriptions for premium content on The Roku Channel for varying fees for different\ncontent. Revenue from such premium subscription fees is recognized on a gross basis over the service period as the\nCompany is deemed to be the principal in the relationship with the end user. The Company obtains control of the\ncontent before transferring to the end user and has latitude in establishing pricing. The Company pays fixed fees\nto the providers of premium content on The Roku Channel based on the contractual arrangement and recognizes that in\nCost of revenue, platform.\nThe Company sells branded channel buttons on remote controls of streaming devices that provide one-touch access to\na publisher’s content. The Company typically receives a fixed fee per button for each unit sold over a defined\ndistribution period. Revenue is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the distribution term.\nThe Company licenses the Roku OS, including updates and upgrades, to TV brands and service operators. The licensing\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time, when the Company makes the intellectual property available and the\ncontrol transfers to the customer. The revenue allocated to unspecified upgrades is recognized on a time elapsed\nbasis, by day, over the service period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are provided or\naccepted. Hosting fees are recognized on a time elapsed basis, by day, over the service period.\nPlayer segment:\nThe Company sells the majority of its players and audio products to retail distribution channels in the U.S.,\nincluding brick and mortar and online retailers, as well as through the Company’s website. Player revenue primarily\nconsists of hardware, embedded software and unspecified upgrades on a when and if-available basis. The hardware and\nembedded software are considered as one performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a point in time when\nthe control transfers to the customer. Unspecified upgrades or enhancements are available to customers on a when-\nand-if available basis. The Company records the allocated value of the unspecified upgrades as deferred revenue and\nrecognizes it as player revenue ratably on a time elapsed basis over the estimated economic life of the associated\nplayers.\nThe Company’s player revenue includes allowances for sales returns and sales incentives in the estimated\ntransaction price. These estimates are based on historical experience and anticipated performance. Shipping charges\nbilled to customers are included in Revenue and the related shipping costs are included in Cost of revenue.\n85\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance in Leases (Topic 842), using the optional transition method\nand recorded operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities on its consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at its inception.Operating leases are included in\noperating lease right-of-use assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance\nsheets.ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the\nlease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The Company takes\ninto consideration its credit rating and the length of the lease when calculating the incremental borrowing rate.\nThe Company considers the options to extend or terminate the lease in determining the lease term, when it is\nreasonably certain to exercise one of the options. The Company combines lease and non-lease components into a\nsingle lease component for its real estate and equipment leases.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies fair\nvalue accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to\ntheir short-term nature.The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rates.\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Provisions are made if the cost of the inventories\nexceeds their net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory levels and purchase commitments for excess and\nobsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally ranging between and five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the\n.\nThe Company capitalizes costs to develop its internal-use software. Costs that relate to the planning and post-\nimplementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized when preliminary efforts are\nsuccessfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the\nproject will be completed and will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result\nin additional material functionality are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the\nCompany capitalized internal-use software development costs of $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively.\nCapitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which\nis generally to , beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. During the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018, the Company amortized expenses of $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company’s deferred revenue reflects fees received from licensing and service arrangements, including\nadvertising, that will be recognized as revenue over time or as services are rendered. Deferred revenue balances\nconsist of the amount of player sales allocated to unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when-and-if available\n86\nbasis, licensing and services fees from service operators and TV brands, and payments from advertisers and content\npublishers. Deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year is classified as current liabilities and the\nremaining is recorded as noncurrent liabilities.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in Sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The Company incurred advertising costs of $ million, $ million and $ million for the\nyears December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and stock\noptions granted to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. For restricted\nstock units, the grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s Class A common stock\non the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nNet Loss per Share\nSince the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted\nnet loss per share for all periods as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding and potentially\ndilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)\n2016-13,Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThe guidance amended reporting of credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt\nsecurities to require that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather\nthan as a write-down.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective adoption method and recorded\na cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit of approximately $ 1.1million. The\nmeasurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and subsequent changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses are recorded in the statements of operations. This impact mainly relates to credit losses recognized\non the Company’s doubtful accounts. As the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt securities as of the\nadoption date, there was no additional impact to accumulated deficit.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02,Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and\nEntertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350): Improvements to Accounting for Costs\nof Films and License Agreements for Program Materials, in order to align the accounting for production costs of an\nepisodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the content distinction\nfor capitalization. ASU 2019-02 also requires that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film in a film\ngroup and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 requires that an entity test films and\nlicense agreements for program material for impairment at a film group level when the film\n87\nor license agreements are predominantly monetized with other films and license agreements. OnJanuary 1, 2020, the\nCompanyadopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02. There wasnomaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe Company also adopted the following ASUs effective January 1, 2020, none of which had a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial position or results of operations.\nASU          Description\nASU 2018-15  Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Topic 350), Customer’s Accounting for\nImplementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\nASU 2018-13  Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements\nfor Fair Value Measurement\nASU 2017-04  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\nASU2019-04   Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842)—Amendments to SEC\nASU2020-02   Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on\nEffective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)\nASU2020-03   Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04,Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference\nRate Reform on Financial Reporting. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S.\nGAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank\nOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) that is expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. The guidance is\neffective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company made a policy election in the second quarter\nof 2020 to elect a different reference rate for the Credit Agreement when LIBOR is discontinued. It is still\nuncertain when the transition from LIBOR to another reference rate will occur or which reference rate will become\nthe accepted market alternative to LIBOR.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income\nTaxes, to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and\nalso simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial\nstatements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes. The guidance is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the\nfinancial statements.\n88\n3. REVENUE\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenues are represented by the reportable segments discussed in Note 17.\nThe contract balances include the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020          2019          2018\nAccounts receivable, net                 $             523,852    $  332,673    $  183,078\nContract assets (included in Prepaid                     7,431         3,588           753\nexpenses and other current assets)\nDeferred revenue, current portion                       55,465        39,861        45,442\nDeferred revenue, non-current portion                   21,283        15,370        19,594\nTotal deferred revenue                   $              76,748    $   55,231    $   65,036\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns,\nand sales incentives. Payment terms can vary by customer and contract.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are created\nwhen invoicing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable\nwhen the right to invoice becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are generally current in nature and\nare included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.Contract assets increased by $ million during the year\nended December 31, 2020 and by $ million during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in\nthe growth of platform revenue combined with the timing of billing which falls into a subsequent period.\nContract liabilities are included in deferred revenue and reflect consideration invoiced prior to the completion of\nperformance obligations and revenue recognition. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $ million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 due to the increase in estimated values of content publisher and licensing partner\narrangements and change in the timing of fulfillment of performance obligations of approximately $ million, and\nhigher growth in the player segment, resulting in a net increase in deferred revenue related to unspecified\nupgrades of approximately $ million. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $ million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 primarily due to revenue recognized of $ million pursuant to customer acceptance of a\nmilestone,and the remaining revenue recognized primarily relates to thetiming of fulfillment of performance\nobligations.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of December\n31, 2019 was $ million. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 from amounts included in\ndeferred revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $ million.\nThe Company recognized $ 14.4million and $ 10.9million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, from performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods due to the changes in\ntransaction price of its revenue contracts.\nCustomer C accounted for %, % and % of the total net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively.\n89\n4. business combination\nOn November 8, 2019, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of dataxu, Inc., (“dataxu”) according to the terms\nand conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2019(the “Merger Agreement”).dataxu is\na demand-side platform (“DSP”) that enables marketers to plan and buy video ad campaigns. The acquisition of\ndataxu’s platform complements the Company’s OTT advertising platform and enables marketers to access a single,\ndata-driven software solution to plan, buy, and optimize their ad spend across TV and OTT providers.\nThe total purchase consideration for dataxu was $ 147.3million, which consisted of $ 77.6million in cash and $\n69.7million for the fair value of the Company’s 571,459shares of Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, the Company had deposited $ 18.8million into an escrow account to secure certain indemnifications and\nother potential obligations. As of the year ended December 31, 2020, a balance of $ 13.6million is unreleased and\nremains in the escrow account.\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on\nacquisition date is based on estimated fair values and is as follows (in thousands):\nEstimated Useful Lives\nAssets acquired                           Fair Values                   (in years)\nCurrent assets                         $       50,829\nRestricted cash                                 1,303\nProperty and equipment, net                     4,503\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped Technology                           56,400                          6.0\nCustomer relationships                         13,400                          4.0\nTradename                                         400                          0.5\nGoodwill                                       71,676\nOperating lease right-of-use assets            24,658\nOther long-term assets                            235\nTotal assets acquired                         223,404\nLiabilities assumed\nCurrent liabilities                           (51,428  )\nOperating lease liabilities                   (24,658  )\nTotal liabilities assumed                     (76,086  )\nTotal purchase consideration           $      147,318\nThe fair value estimates of the net assets acquired are based upon calculations and valuations, and those estimates\nand assumptions regarding certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the total\nconsideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities is recorded as\ngoodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in our advertising offerings and cross-selling\nopportunities.\nThe goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes. In connection with the acquisition, a deferred tax\nliability is established for the book/tax differences related to non-goodwill intangible assets. The deferred tax\nliability is not reflected as the Company also acquired deferred tax assets, including significant net operating\nlosses, that offset the deferred tax liability. Additionally, both companies have full valuation allowances\nrecorded against their respective deferred tax assets, resulting in a net zero adjustment to deferred taxes on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n90\n5.

The licensing arrangements can be for a fixed fee\nor variable fee. The licensing arrangements specify the period when the content is available for streaming. The\nCompany capitalizes the fixed content fees and its corresponding liability when the license period begins, the cost\nof the content is known, and the content is accepted and available for streaming. If the licensing fee is not\ndeterminable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded, and licensing costs are expenses as\nincurred. The Company amortizes licensed content assets into Cost of Revenue, Platform, using the straight-line\nmethod over the contractual period of availability. The liability is paid in accordance with the contractual terms\nof the arrangement. On , the Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2019-02, Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film\nCosts (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment—Broadcasters—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350):\nImprovements to Accounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials, on a prospective basis.\nThe adoption did not have material impact on its financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, licensed content assets that met these requirements were $ million and are recorded in\n“Other non-current assets.” As of December 31, 2019, licensed content assets that met these requirements were $\nmillion and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Payments for content, including additions to\ncontent assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within Net cash provided by operating\nactivities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The increase in the content asset is due to a change in\nthe mix of content licensed and the period over which such content is available for streaming. The corresponding\nliability is included in Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities and is discussed in Note 12.\nThe Company recorded amortization expense of $ million and $ million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, in Cost of revenue, platform in the consolidated statements of operations, related to\ncapitalized licensed content assets.\nYear Ending December 31,\n2021                        6,527\n2022                        1,338\n2023                           42\n93\nLicensed content assets are primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group. The film group is\nevaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than\nthe carrying value. The Company reviews various qualitative factors and indicators to assess whether the group\nasset is impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did t recognize any impairment for capitalized licensed\ncontent assets.\n8.

Further, the Company maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and to utilize a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used\nto measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured using Level 1 inputs include cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company measured money market funds of $ million\nand $ million as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or\ncorroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe Company did not have Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nNon-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-\nuse assets and licensed content assets are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to fair value using Level 3\ninputs, only when impairment is recognized. The impairments for operating ROU assets recorded by the Company for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not material.\n94\n9.

Generally, stock options granted to employees vest % after and have a term of . Restricted\nstock units generally vest over years. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amount of stock-\nbased compensation capitalized as part of internal use software was not material.\nThe following table shows total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018 (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nCost of platform revenue          $                       847    $     342    $      97\nCost of player revenue                                  1,407        1,072          469\nResearch and development                               58,412       40,036       18,538\nSales and marketing                                    42,846       24,179       10,459\nGeneral and administrative                             30,564       19,546        8,111\nTotal stock-based compensation    $                   134,076    $  85,175    $  37,674\nThe fair value of options granted under the 2008 Plan and 2017 Plan is estimated on the grant date using the Black-\nScholes option-valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to\nmake certain assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term,\nthe expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, an assumed risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.\nThe Company uses the straight-line method for expense recognition. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they\noccur.\n99\nFair Value of Common Stock:The Company uses the market closing price for the Class A common stock as reported on\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nExpected Term: The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected\nto be outstanding and is determined based on the simplified method as described in ASC Topic 718-10-S99-1,SEC\nMaterials SAB Topic 14, Share-Based Payment.\nExpected Volatility: The Company’s volatility factor is estimated using several comparable public company\nvolatilities for similar option terms.\nExpected Dividends: The Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends in\nthe future, and as a result, the expected dividends are $ 0.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on\nU.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the estimated life of the stock options. Where\nthe expected term of the Company’s stock options does not correspond with the term for which an interest rate is\nquoted, the Company performs a straight-line interpolation to determine the rate from the available term\nmaturities.\nThe assumptions used to value stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as\nfollows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020            2019            2018\nExpected term (in years)                   5.0 - 6.7       5.0 - 6.7       5.3 - 6.8\nRisk-free interest rate                 0.22 - 1.67%    1.35 - 2.56%    2.32 - 2.88%\nExpected volatility                         36 - 39%        35 - 36%        38 - 40%\nDividend rate                                      —               —               —\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business.\nIn order to manage future demand for its products, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers and\nsuppliers to procure inventory based upon certain criteria and timing. Some of these commitments are non-\ncancelable. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ million purchase commitments for inventory.\nThe Company records a liability for non-cancelable purchase commitments in excess of projected demand forecasts.\nThe Company recorded $ million and $ million for these purchase commitments in “Accrued liabilities” as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLicense Content Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a liability of $ million in Accrued liabilities and $ million in\nOther long-term liabilities for licensed content that is available for streaming. As of December 31, 2019, the\nCompany recorded $ million as obligations in Accrued liabilities for licensed content that is available for\nstreaming. The increase in content liability is due to change in the mix of content licensed and the period over\nwhich this content is available for streaming.\nThe Company also enters into contracts with content publishers to acquire content or to buy ad inventory in the\nfuture.As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ million in commitments with content publishers for content or to\nbuy ad inventory that are non-cancellable. These commitments include both content that is available\n100\nfor streaming and is recognized as liabilities as well as content that is not yet available for streaming or ad\ninventories not yet purchased.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had irrevocable letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $\nmillion and $ million, respectively, related to facilities leases. The letters of credit have various expiration\ndates through 2030.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues for loss contingencies, including liabilities for intellectual property licensing claims, when\nit believes such losses are probable and reasonably estimable.These contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly\nand adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel\nand other information and events. The resolution of these contingencies and of other legal proceedings can be,\nhowever, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any loss contingencies that are material.During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, the Company recorded expenses of $ 9.9million, in total cost of revenue, for various claims\nrelated to patent infringements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company changed its estimate of\ncertain liabilities previously recorded for intellectual property licensing and released $ 8.9million as a result\nof its assessment that the likelihood of payment is now remote. The reversal of $ 8.9million is recorded within\ncost of revenue, player during the year ended December 31, 2018, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and investigations in the ordinary course\nof business, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. The\nCompany is involved in litigation matters not listed herein. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, and\ninvestigations cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the final outcome of any\nmatters that it is currently involved in are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements which provide\nindemnification provisions of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to\ncertain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and\nout of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties.The Company’s obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against\nthird parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain\nliabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements.\n13.

As a result of the Company’s analysis of all available objective\nevidence, both positive and negative, as of December 31, 2020, management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe U.S. deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation\nallowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's valuation allowance increased by $ million and $ million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, primarily due to U.S. federal and state tax losses and credits incurred during the period.\nFor federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respective net operating loss carryforwards of $ million and $\nmillion are available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to\nexpire in for federal and certain state net operating losses have expired in . The federal net operating loss\ngenerated subsequent to 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely.\nFor U.K. and Denmark income tax reporting purposes, the net operating loss carryforward of $ million and $ million,\nrespectively, is available to reduce the future taxable income, if any. U.K. and Denmark net operating loss can be\ncarried forward indefinitely. The Company also has U.K. research and development tax credit carryforwards of $\nmillion. The credit can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of $ million and $\nmillion for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in and , respectively.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains provisions that may limit the net operating\nloss and credit carryforwards available for use in any given period upon the occurrence of certain events,\nincluding a statutorily defined significant change in ownership. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of\nthe Code. The Company has assessed whether any section 382 ownership change has occurred since its formation and\ndetermined that a section 382 ownership change occurred on December 18, 2009 and tax attributes generated by the\nCompany through the ownership change date are subject to the limitation.\nA section 382 study was completed for dataxu covering the period from inception beginning May 1, 2008 through\nacquisition date of November 8, 2019. Based on the study, the Company identified fourownership changes for Section\n382 purposes. As such, tax attributes generated by dataxu through the ownership change dates are subject to the\nlimitation.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 is $ million, of which $ million is composed\nof research and development credits and $ million is related international activities.\nAs of December 31,\n2020            2019\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $              19,487       $  14,541\nof year\nGross increase for tax positions of                         9,959          10,378\ncurrent year\nGross decrease due to statue expiration                       (75  )          (88  )\nGross decrease for tax positions of                          (196  )       (5,344  )\nprior years\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end    $              29,175       $  19,487\nof year\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $ million of accrued interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions.\n103\nChange in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would have an immaterial impact on its effective tax\nrate. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12\nmonths.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.\nThe Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, which are not\nsignificant. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,\nthe Company has not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes,\nstate income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of\nunrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company did not engage in any material related party transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020. There\nwere material amounts payable to or receivable from related parties as of December 31, 2020.\nIn prior years, the Company engaged in transactions with one of its strategic investors. With respect to this\ninvestor, the Company recorded revenue of $ million and $ million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. The Company had an accounts receivable balance of $ million as of December 31, 2019 related to\ntransactions with this investor. The Company incurred expenses of $ million and $ million with this investor for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had a payable of $ million to this investor\nas of December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the Company had engaged in transactions with another company in which the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer holds a majority voting interest and is a member of such company’s board of directors, and another member\nof the Company’s Board of Directors is such company’s Chief Executive Officer. With respect to transactions with\nthis other company, the Company incurred expenses of $ million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were\noutstanding amounts payable to this other company as of December 31, 2019. The Company did t consummate any\ntransactions with the other company for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n15. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) tax deferred saving plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of qualified\nemployees. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the Savings Plan on a biweekly basis, subject to\ncertain limitations. The Company may make contributions to the Savings Plan at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors. contributions were made for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2014, the Company established a defined contribution plan in the U.K. for its U.K.-based employees. The Company\ncontributed $ million, $ million and $ million to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.\n16. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding for the period. For purposes of the calculation of diluted net loss per share\noptions to purchase common stock, restricted stock units and unvested shares of common stock issued upon the early\nexercise of stock options and business acquisitions are considered common stock equivalents, but have been excluded\nfrom the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is antidilutive. Because the Company has\nreported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, diluted net loss per common share is the\nsame as the basic net loss per share for those years.\n104\nThe table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share as follows (in thousands, except per\nshare data):\nYears Ended December 31,\nNumerator:                                                        2020             2019             2018\nNet loss attributable to common            $                   (17,507  )    $  (59,937  )    $   (8,857  )\nstockholders\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used in\ncomputing net loss per share, basic and                        123,978          115,218          104,618\ndiluted\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted      $                     (0.14  )    $    (0.52  )    $    (0.08  )\nThe potential common shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their\neffect would have been antidilutive for the periods presented are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020      2019      2018\nEquity awards to purchase common stock                        13,088    15,668    20,057\nUnvested shares of common stock issued\nupon early exercise of stock options and                           1        31        70\nbusiness acquisition\nTotal                                                         13,089    15,699    20,127\n17. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and\nevaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, and the CODM evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial information\npresented on a consolidated basis and on revenue and gross profit for each operating segment. The Company uses the\nmanagement approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented\nseparately in the Company’s notes to its consolidated financial statements. The management approach is based on the\nmanner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating\nresources, and assessing performance.\nThe Company reports its financial results consistent with the manner in which financial information is viewed by\nmanagement for decision-making purposes. The Company does not manage operating expenses such as research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses at the segment level.\nThe Company is organized into reportable segments as follows:\nPlatform\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of digital advertising, content distribution services, subscription and\ntransaction revenue share including Premium Subscriptions, sale of branded buttons on remote controls and licensing\narrangements with service operators and TV brands.\nPlayer\nConsists of revenue generated from sale of streaming players, audio products and accessories through retailers and\ndistributors, as well as directly to customers through the Company’s website.\nThe Company does not allocate property and equipment or any other assets or capital expenditures to reportable\nsegments. Operating expenses are not managed at the segment level.\n105\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the financial measures, including segment\ngross profit, which are regularly reviewed by the CODM and provide insight into the individual segments and their\nability to contribute to Company’s operating results.\nCustomers accounting for 10% or more of segment revenue, net, were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020       2019       2018\nPlatform segment revenue\nCustomer H                                        13  %       *          *\nPlayer segment revenue\nCustomer A                                        10  %      16  %      15  %\nCustomer B                                        18  %      17  %      15  %\nCustomer C                                        40  %      39  %      38  %\nRevenue in international markets was less than % in each of the periods presented.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included\nbelow.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected.\n107\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Roku, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Roku, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the\nCompany and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and\nincluded an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in method of accounting for leases in fiscal year\n2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 25, 2021\n108",
