Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 4, 2022, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”)
commenced an offering of senior unsecured notes. On August 9, 2022, the Company entered into an indenture (the
“Base Indenture”)
and a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”)
with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, pursuant to which the Company issued $2.75 billion
aggregate principal
amount of its 3.500% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $3.00 billion aggregate principal amount
of its 3.850%
senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the “2032 Notes”), $2.75 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.450% senior
unsecured
notes due 2052 (the “2052 Notes”) and $1.50 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.650% senior unsecured notes
due 2062
(the “2062 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes, the 2032 Notes and the 2052 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes
were offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation
S under the Securities Act.
The Notes bear interest at
a rate of 3.500% per year with respect to the 2027 Notes, 3.850% per year with respect to the 2032 Notes, 4.450%
per year with respect
to the 2052 Notes, and 4.650% per year with respect to the 2062 Notes, respectively. Interest on the Notes is
payable semi-annually in
arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2023. The Company will pay interest
to those persons who
were holders of record on the February 1 or August 1 immediately preceding each interest payment date. The Notes
are unsecured obligations
of the Company. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions.

Each series of Notes will
be redeemable as a whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time and from time to time prior to the
applicable Par Call

plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
