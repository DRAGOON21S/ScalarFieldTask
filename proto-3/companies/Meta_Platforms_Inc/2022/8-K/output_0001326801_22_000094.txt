Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

As previously disclosed by Meta Platforms, Inc. (the "Company"), former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg
will no longer serve as an employee of the Company after September 30, 2022, but will continue to serve as a member
of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and will receive compensation as a non-employee director pursuant
to the Company's Director Compensation Policy (the "Director Compensation Policy").

As described in more detail in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 8, 2022, the Company has provided an overall security program for Ms. Sandberg in light of
specific threats to her safety as a result of her high-profile role, and the Company also provides personal
security services to non-employee members of the Board from time to time under the Director Compensation Policy.

On September 26, 2022, in light of continuing threats to her safety identified by the Company's security
professional assessments, and as also recommended by the Compensation, Nominating & Governance Committee of the
Board, the Board approved the provision of personal security services to Ms. Sandberg under the Director
Compensation Policy, for a period from her transition to a non-employee director role on October 1, 2022 up to June
30, 2023. As part of the security program, the Company will pay for certain costs related to personal security for
Ms. Sandberg at her residences and during personal travel, including the costs of security personnel for her
protection .
