          "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build\ntechnology that helps people connect and share, find communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people\nto connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and\nmixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the\nworld around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with\naudiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected\neverywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences\nlike augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology. Our vision for the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of\nexperiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we\nbelieve it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction. Across our work, we are\ninnovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more\nsocial, useful, and immersive.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is\nreflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such\nas generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of\nconsumer hardware products, software, and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2024, we intend to focus on six key investment areas:\nAI, the metaverse, our discovery engine, monetization of our products and services, regulatory readiness, and\nenhancing developer efficiency to build, iterate, and optimize products quickly. Our AI investments support\ninitiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our\ndiscovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of\nnew generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive.\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2023, 80% of our total costs\nand expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $70.13 billion in 2023\nand include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts,\nincluding developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and\nother foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating\nto headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we\nexpect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully\nrealized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem\nwill develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability\nto support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We\nexpect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is\nthe next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and\ncreators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\nFamily of Apps Products\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups,\nMarketplace, and more.\n7\nTable of Contents\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nLive, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video,\nand private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ncommunities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\nThreads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come\ntogether to discuss topics of interest. People can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who\nlove the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their ideas, opinions, and creativity with\nthe world.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a\none-to-many broadcast service designed to help people follow information from people and organizations that are\nimportant to them.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products\nthat are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new\ntechnologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using\nneuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the\nnear term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality Labs products that help people\nfeel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nOur current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available\nthrough the Meta Quest Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical\ndistance while engaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, Meta Horizon Worlds is a social\nplatform where people can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events.\nTo drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have also introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to\nexperience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta\nQuest Pro and Meta Quest 3 devices.\nWe have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream\nvideo and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We also offer Meta Spark, a platform that\nallows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our\napps.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR\nand social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to\ngo to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects.\nFor example, in 2024, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our AR\ninitiatives, approximately 40% on our VR (including MR) initiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and\nother initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared\ncosts across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse ecosystem and\nour business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant\nchanges as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs\nevolve.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and\ndiscover content and information online or\n8\nTable of Contents\nenable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people\nwho use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services,\nand to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also\ncompete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and\nservices. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing\nproducts evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop\nthe metaverse or innovate through the development and application of new technologies such as AI.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR\nincreases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have\ndesigned and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion\nof our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate\nour products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new\nones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and\nintegrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse.\nAcross all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to,\namong other things, recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance\nour advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new\nproducts as well as new features for existing products.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate offices in approximately 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales\npresence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and\npartners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers,\nresellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and\nenterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data\nretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic\ncontracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls\nincluding sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment\nservices. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and\nregulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States, and create the\npotential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could\nadversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated\nbased on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in\nwhich the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition,\nthere have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available\nto online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes\nto our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs as a\nbasis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish\nData Protection Committee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs\nin respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as\nwell as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its\nprocessing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of\nsuch data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to\nan interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States\nannounced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On\nOctober 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals\nIntelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making\nup the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the\nE.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The\nadequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data\ntransferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy\nFramework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the\nEU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones,\nand we are implementing steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. If we\nare required to take additional steps to comply with the corrective orders, this could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our products and services in Europe. Furthermore, the EU-U.S. DPF replaces\n10\nTable of Contents\ntwo prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the\nCJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement\nadditional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our\nlead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still\nevolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In\naddition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing\ndata privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted\nby other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. Some\nstates have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under\n18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject\nto interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain\ncohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In addition, the European Union's\nePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely\naffect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans\nto change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from\n\"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for\nno ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding\ncompliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. These or any similar\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions\nand requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services,\nmergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and\nits key requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA\nhas caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products\nor business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and\nregulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other\njurisdictions could have similar effects. We are also subject to content-related legislation such as the Digital\nServices Act (DSA) in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain\nrestrictions and requirements for our products and services, and subjects us to increased compliance costs. The DSA\nalso includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are\nconsidering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to\nour products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our\nproducts and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or\nregulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in\nlimitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain\njurisdictions.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use and data protection, including with respect to processing\nof sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, safety, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or\notherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the\nfuture be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into\nwith the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and,\n11\nTable of Contents\namong other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and\noversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an\nadministrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of\nthe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency\nimposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our\nability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries\nor enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial\ncosts, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including\nsubstantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially\nadverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity\nand reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us\nto other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company\nculture.\nWe had a global workforce of 67,317 employees as of December 31, 2023, and we have offices in approximately 90\ncities around the world. We are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are\nfocused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We offer competitive compensation and a\nwide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources, and we work to build a diverse and\ninclusive workplace.\nBeginning in November 2022, we took a number of steps to reduce our expense base. For example, our cost reduction\nefforts have included scaling back budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and\nemployee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a\ngenerous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance of 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional\nweeks for every year of service, payment for all remaining paid time off, restricted stock unit vesting through\ntheir last day on payroll, health insurance, coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families\nfor six months, career services that included three months of career support with an external vendor and early\naccess to unpublished job leads, immigration support that included dedicated immigration specialists to help guide\nemployees based on their needs. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while\ntaking into account local employment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees\nwith regular performance reviews twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth\nand career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at Meta. We also offer career development\nopportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we\nutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning,\nself-service resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta\nand what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal\nexperience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an\nongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company\nchanges. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive\nchange across the company. In 2024, we expect to update our listening strategy and product capabilities, based on\nfeedback from key groups, to further improve actionability and impact.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in July\n2023, we announced that our analyses confirm that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and by\nrace in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents\nwith resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance,\ncommunity, and time away, including family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans,\naccess to legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, and health and well-being benefits.\nOur health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach\ntheir personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health,\ncreate financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community. Programs\nare designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being,\nincluding mental health programs and retirement savings, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees\nand their dependents.\nDiverse and Inclusive Workplace\nWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to\nbuild the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\nIn our 2023 Responsible Business Practices Report, we published our global diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity\nworkforce data. As of December 31, 2022, our global employee base was composed of 45.4% underrepresented people,\nwith 47.9% underrepresented people in the U.S., and 43.1% of our leaders in the U.S. being people of color. As\npublished in our 2023 Responsible Business Practices Report, people with disabilities now represent 7.2% of our\nU.S. workforce, and based on voluntary self-identification, veterans represented 2.3% and members of the LGBTQ+\ncommunity make up 9.8% of our U.S. workforce.\nWe want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to\ndo that. We also remain committed to having a skilled, inclusive and diverse workforce because we believe cognitive\ndiversity fuels innovation. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias from our hiring processes and\nperformance management systems, as well as offering learning and development courses for our employees.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nour ability to compete effectively;\nfluctuations in our financial results;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service, catastrophic events, and crises;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital\nMarkets Act (DMA), and Digital Services Act (DSA);\n15\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy, consumer protection, and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents, as well as intentional misuse of our services and other undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Board Chair, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our active user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our\nsuccess. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in\nadding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook\nand Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of\nour active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved\nhigher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including\ncompetitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and\nservices, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to\nperiod at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to\nFacebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government,\nwhich contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any\nfuture declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and,\nin turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and our competitors introduce new and different products\nand services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n16\nTable of Contents\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European courts invalidating the\nEU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer\nuser data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of changes\nthat we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the\nEuropean Union's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, U.S. state privacy and youth social media laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Arkansas Social\nMedia Safety Act, Ohio Parental Notification Act, Utah Social Media Regulation Act, or other laws, regulations, or\nregulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise\nobjectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the\nsecurity and integrity of our platform;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different\nproducts and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of evolving technologies such\nas generative artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our\ncompetitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;\n17\nTable of Contents\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user\ngrowth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment);\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for\nour users to interact and share on third-party applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order\nto grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to\ndo business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a\ncompetitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce\nour ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\ndemand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the\n18\nTable of Contents\neffectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and\nGoogle;\nadverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to\nadvertising, including developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher\nrate, such as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video\nor messaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to\nthe United States are invalid;\nlimitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer\ncertain products or services to certain cohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws and\nregulations in the United States and other jurisdictions, or otherwise;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\napplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available\non our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns\nabout brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance\nobligations;\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to or opt out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, DMA, other laws, regulations,\nregulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes (for\nexample, in November 2023, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we began offering our users a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland);\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other\nregions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely\naffected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can be subject to\nadverse effects from the Israel-Hamas war).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to\nimpact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\nnot control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example,\nlegislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, as amended by the CPRA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe\nfollowing product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have\nintroduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the\nCCPA. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other\njurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\"\nto \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative.\nWe are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the\nability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services,\nincluding changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory\nframeworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and\nnegatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by\nmarketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are\nunable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement\ncapabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising\nrevenue.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in\nthe past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our\nability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our\nability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our\nproducts or our delivery of ads have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the usage of our\nproducts and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser\nthat limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users\nand impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads\neffectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition, in January 2024, Google began the process\nof phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, Google's,\nor other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads\nand impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our\nproducts work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem\nor in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or\nstandards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile\ndevices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products\nthat do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time,\nwe may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what\nwe believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships\nwith the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other\nbusiness partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated\nlong-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships\nwith such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and\nour business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks,\ntechnologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively\nimpact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely\naffect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer\nhardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant\ninvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we recently launched new\nAI features on our products, including conversational AIs, stickers, and editing tools. We continue to incur\nsubstantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging\nproducts to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited\nfashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over\nthe long term. We also recently commenced implementation of end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on\nFacebook and Instagram, which has been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions.\n21\nTable of Contents\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our\nbusiness plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue,\noperating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend\nrelevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features\nfor existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in\ninfrastructure and headcount.\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of\nAI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or\nprofitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to\nrisks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation (including related to elections), bias,\ndiscrimination, toxicity, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy,\ncybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to\nonline services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we\nare subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal\nliability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten\npeople's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various\ngovernmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering\napplying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and data protection laws to AI and/or are\nconsidering general legal frameworks on AI. We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will\napply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to\nthese frameworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adjust our offerings\nin certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and\ntechnologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our\ntechnologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI\nsector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would\nprevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Further, our ability to\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment\nand other physical infrastructure, such as processing hardware and network capacity, as to which we cannot control\nthe availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license\nagreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not\nhave insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such,\nwe cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through\nthe dissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or\nmisappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination, cybersecurity attacks, data privacy violations, other\nactivities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to develop competing technologies. While\nwe may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we\ncannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and\nregulations governing the use of AI may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\nliability.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking\nalgorithms or other product features to improve the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the\nfuture have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could\nadversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative\nprominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to\ncontinue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of\npublishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.\nWe also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products,\nthat attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization,\nsuch as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products,\nfrom time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products\nand services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower\nrate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\ninfrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies,\ndevelopers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We\nregularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological\nchallenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited\nexperience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other\ncompanies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development\nefforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop\nproducts that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our\nmetaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these\nefforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of\nour business. In addition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws\nand regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety,\ncompetition, content regulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of\nour products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or\notherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not\nbe successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or\nfinancial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users,\nmarketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may\nnot do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive\nexperience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise\nthrough our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions\nor decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising,\ncompetition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with\nelections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\nreputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and\nregulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents\nrelating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices,\nas well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in\nMarch 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or\nappropriately to the sharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are\nillegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce our policies, address objectionable\ncontent or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which\ncould erode confidence in our brands.\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate\nto other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or\nservices to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by\nperceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to\ncensor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends,\nincluding, for example, any such actions around geopolitical events or elections in the United States and around\nthe world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board,\nby research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-\nbeing, by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who\nviolate our community standards or terms of service, or by any negative sentiment associated with our management.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not\nbe successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being\nissues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial\nresults may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that\nintegrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications\nthat integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building,\ngrowing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose\nto build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that\nintegrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers\nwith our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that\ncontinues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce\nthe volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the\nuser experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization\nopportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to\nprivacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some\ninstances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we\nare unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create,\nshare, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or\nprospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain\nbusinesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who\nbuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and\ndeliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. We also expect to face\nadditional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other\ncompanies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate\nthrough the development and application of new technologies such as AI.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we\nmake updates to our products and services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with\nsafe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user\ndemographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by\nmaking access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our\nusers; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile\ndevice operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google\nhave integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to\niOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure\nads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we\ncannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\n25\nTable of Contents\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a\nparticular period;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\n26\nTable of Contents\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our business\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment or abandonment of any assets on our balance sheet, including as a result of\nchanges to our real property lease arrangements and data center assets;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking that prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated

judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection,\nantitrust, content, or AI, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from\n27\nTable of Contents\nacquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal\nand tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-\nmarketable equity securities, and in interest rates;\nthe incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, which may impact the other\nfactors described above.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Our reputation has been, and could in the future be,\nadversely affected by unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies,\nproduct decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our\nadvertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products\nor services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of\nservice, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform,\nthe perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the actions of\nother companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media\ncoverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other\ncontent, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics.\nBeginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the\nrelease of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be,\nsubject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable\nuse of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in the United\nStates and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and\nloyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased\nrevenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to\nvarying degrees from time to time.\nWe are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions,\nother natural disasters, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-\nattacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic previously significantly\nimpacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic resulted in authorities implementing\nnumerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel\nbans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders, which caused\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. These developments led to volatility in\nthe demand for and pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may\nexperience similar effects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other catastrophic events. Such events also\nexpose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\n28\nTable of Contents\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments\nin Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the\nfuture as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data\nthey share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new\nand existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue\nto invest in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in\nlight of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives,\nand some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to\nreduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part\nof our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant\ninvestments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and\nprofitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2023 overall operating profit by approximately\n$16.12 billion, and we expect our Reality Labs investments and operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024.\nIf our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our products and services could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and\nengagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and services and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and services from time to time. Our\nsystems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable\nwhen users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or\nservices as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could\nadversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from\ntime to time. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and\nevolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands\ncontinue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible\nthat we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these\nincreased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue. In addition, our\nbusiness may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather\nconditions, other natural\n29\nTable of Contents\ndisasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other\ncatastrophic events and crises. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring\nmore frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service\ndisruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely\nmanner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and\nmay in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintain the availability or performance of\nour products and services in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in\nthe services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and\ncould significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely\naffect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to\nproblems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various\nchallenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have adjusted,\nand may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not\nbe able to secure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may\nbe required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or\nservices, require unfavorable changes to existing products or services, delay the introduction of future products\nor services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our\ntechnical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\ndeveloping regions that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and\npolitical challenges, among others. We have changed, suspended, and terminated certain of these projects as a\nresult of various factors, and may continue to do so in the future. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions\nin the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power, or network capacity,\nor any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required\ngovernment or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result\nof trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in\nthe delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on\nour balance sheet. For example, like others in our industry, we rely on certain third-party equipment and\ncomponents for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with\nsignificant operations in a single region such as Asia. Any of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including\nactions by governments or geopolitical events such as international conflicts, could result in tariffs, sanctions,\nexport controls, and other measures that restrict international trade, could reduce or eliminate the ability of our\nsuppliers, manufacturers, or other third-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or\neliminate our ability to purchase, key components of our technical infrastructure.\nIn addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases\nof design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying\nequipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical\ninfrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such\ngovernment action, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical\ninfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to\na negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics\n30\nTable of Contents\nrequire significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or\nchanges in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time\nwe discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data\nlimitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do\nnot intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within\nthe error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in\nmeasuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our Family metrics estimates in some instances exceed\nestimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible\nthat our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for\ncalculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or\nmobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of\nFamily metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals\nor technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that\nmay improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population\nof our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as\ndefined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have\n31\nTable of Contents\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person\nhas one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as\nwe believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable\ncertain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among\nour users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. Violating accounts are very\ndifficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the\nstability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our\nmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate\na broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it\nis possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other\ninquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not\nperceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or\nestimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less\nwilling to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which could negatively\naffect our business and financial results.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The\nscale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other\nthird parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the\nscale and complexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant\nexperience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage our scale\neffectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial,\nand management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our\npersonnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In\naddition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including\nrestructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities, but we cannot guarantee that\nthey will achieve our intended results. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated\ncosts, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased difficulty managing the scale and complexity of our\nbusiness. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and strategic\ninitiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our\norganization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complex organizational management\nstructures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to\nquickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks\nthat could affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new\ninternational regions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our\nproducts are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in\ncertain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally\navailable in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to\ndeploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are\nsubject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\n33\nTable of Contents\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and\npandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not\nproperly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products\ndepends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. We\nhave experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and\nthe supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development,\nand sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary\ncapabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether\ndue to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in\nthe pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of\nour consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments (including international conflicts that could result in\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to\nsupply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety,\nthe environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them\nviolates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or\nstandards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions,\ngovernment action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023\nfollowing the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-\nacquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after prevailing in\nfederal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of\nsuch acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will\nrealize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on\ninvestment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in\nincreased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions\nand we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase\nour expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,\ndevelopers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources\nto support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of\nresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments\nwill be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits\nexpected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced,\ncurrently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to\nadvertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related\nto the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and\nunproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our\nplatform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third\nparties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of\n2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former\nemployee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential\naudience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the\nsubject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of facial recognition technology, our alleged\nrecommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our\nbusiness tools, our alleged use of copyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that\nFacebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of violations of the Children's\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages\nor fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. As of July 2023,\nnearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As\nthis framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate\nimpact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several\ncountries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are\ntaxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to\nchange or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example,\nseveral jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business\nactivities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary,\nsignificantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future\nimpact, our effective tax rate, sometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price\nvaries from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax\nbenefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2023, excess tax benefits\nrecognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $708 million and our effective\nincome tax rate by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in\nwhich our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\nperiod, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued\nrelative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based\ncompensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not\ncontrol, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect\nour financial results.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results\nof operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr.\nZuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat\nsports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death. If Mr.\nZuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.\nThe loss of other key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development,\nmarketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring specialized\ntechnical personnel, particularly senior engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other\ncompanies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue\nsignificant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial\nadditional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price\nvolatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to\nimmigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing\npersonnel . If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and\nmotivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Board Chair, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or\nprevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our\nother stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential\ninvestor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common\nstock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to\ncontrol the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death,\nthe shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has\ndesignated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in\ngood faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder,\neven a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not\nalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases and dividend payments could also increase the volatility of the trading price\nof our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases, and the specific\ntiming and amount of any\n38\nTable of Contents\ndividend payments, will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, company\nperformance, and other considerations. We cannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or\nthat it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and dividend payments could affect the\ntrading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase\nprogram or dividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this\nrepurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our cash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first-ever quarterly cash dividend. The payment of any cash\ndividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and\nagreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any\ntime, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or\nat all.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides\nauthorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services,\nand if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong is\nalso expected to pass additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect\nto make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security\nLaw or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in\nRussia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will\nlikely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible\nthat the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue,\nwhether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information\nrequests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes\nor other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the\nTurkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise\nadversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is\nsubject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are\nrequired to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our\ncompetitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing\ngeographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our\nuser base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able\nto maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services\nto younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property,\nadvertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce,\ntaxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our\nactivities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws,\nregulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition,\nconsumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than\nthose in the United States, and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced\nby private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and\napplied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and\npractices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display\ncontent to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various\nways, including for advertising, could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the\nmanner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing\nsignificant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms\nIreland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective\norders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations\ninto compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the\nUnited States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay\nfrom the Irish High Court.\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle\non a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive\nOrder on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the\nEuropean Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney\nGeneral as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an\nadequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures\nan adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\nUnited States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the\nadequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we are implementing steps to comply with the above\ncorrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. If we are required to take additional steps to comply with\nthe corrective orders, this could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in\nEurope. Furthermore, the EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A\nfurther invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create\n40\nTable of Contents\nconsiderable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and\nservices, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or\nnew legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have\nimplemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission\nof personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the\nregulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft\ndecisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the\nGDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As\na result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for\nnon-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact\non our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted\nsimilar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to\nusers in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for\nusers, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted\nsimilar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and\nregulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or\nreductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the\nprivacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy\nlaws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products\nand services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising\nbusiness. In Europe, regulators continue to enforce guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements\nregarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could\ndirectly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws\nimpose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for\nnon-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November\n2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage\nwith regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and\nEU consumer laws. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and\nengagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and\nrequirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers\nand acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key\nrequirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA has\ncaused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or\nbusiness practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions\ncould have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which started to apply\nto our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services and\nsubjects us to increased compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In\naddition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data\nprotection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering\nour services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in\nfines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use\ninformation about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government\nactions, have led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs,\nloss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use and data protection,\nincluding with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes,\ndata security, minors, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, use of our\nplatform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In\naddition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example,\ndata protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other\njurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in\nwhich we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, we\nhave been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect\nand use information, including where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment,\ncredit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys\ngeneral, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with\nour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified\nconsent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to\nsignificantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general\ninquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor\nus and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which\nwe are challenging, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection\nAct (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its\ncurrent form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified\nproducts or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy\nregulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to\nchange our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a\nlawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition\ntechnology.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business,\nincluding with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other\nthings, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services,\ndigital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in\n2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of\nJustice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws,\nincluding by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against\nour company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or\nreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement\nof Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes\nEuropean Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to\nour business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to\ngovernment investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a\nformer employee.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA,\nthe DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and\nmodifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, reputation, and financial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\nrequirements around the world, such as the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, the Korean\nPersonal Information Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act. In particular, we are\nmaintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial\nmanagement and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations,\nprohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance\nwith the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party\nassessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance\nand oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually\nreallocate resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an\nadverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to\nour business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a\ntimely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. Further, our privacy compliance and oversight\nefforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our management\nand board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations\nare complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances\nwhere we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to\ncontinue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy\nrequirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For\nexample, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination\nof data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement.\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with\nthe FTC consent order and seeking substantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a\nprohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the\nFTC's administrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order\nin its current form, it would limit our ability to provide certain features and services, engage in certain\nbusiness practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance and\noversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any\nfuture modifications to the order), GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA,\nDSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant authority believes that we are in\nviolation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental\ninvestigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, penalties, or other\nremedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government inquiries relating to information or\ncontent that is published or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations\nrelating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In\nparticular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation\nor news hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights,\nrights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on-\nor offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of\npharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or\notherwise illegal activity), products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For\nexample, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on\nallegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we have been subject to\nlitigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain\njurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear\nor where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019,\nthe European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for\ncopyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which most member states have already\nimplemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media\nService Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. In the United\nStates, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections\navailable to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but\nit ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various\nother litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the\nscope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect\nto commerce listings, user access and content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current\nprotections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial\nor government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany\nand India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to\ncomply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other\ncountries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar\nlegislation imposing liability or potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or\nadvertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have\nbeen subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media\nlegislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-\nrelated legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business\npractices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain\ngeographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain\nauthorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which\nmay require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the\nEuropean Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and\nservices are subject to restrictions and requirements, and we are subject to increased compliance costs, as a\nresult of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023,\nand other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland\nand the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation\nthat may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of\nsuch legislation in Canada, we have removed the availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and\nInstagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to\nthe U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or require\nsignificant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth\nand engagement.\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other\nrisks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual,\nand digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send\nmoney to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other\nprepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable\nfundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments\nactivity as well as sharing, collection, and use of payments-related data. Depending on how our Payments products\nevolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and\nlending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We\nhave received certain payments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions\nfor our regulated Payments-related products and activities. These licenses increase flexibility in how our use of\nPayments may evolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate compliance\nwith many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to\ncomply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and\nmay still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or\nregulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order,\nor we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the\nfuture undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us\nto many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in\nthe future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or\ntake other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other illegal,\nillicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and\nvolume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including\nour efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for\nsuch breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise\nwell-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such\nbreaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience or otherwise\nadversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive,\nand to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other\ntechnical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including social engineering or other\ncyber-attacks directed towards our personnel, misuse of company data or systems by our personnel, as well as\ndefects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance;\nbreaches of physical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats\nthat evolve. In addition, third parties\n45\nTable of Contents\nmay attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data\nor our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult\nto detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect\nour data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities\non our platform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute\nsecurity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span numerous\ngeographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and\nother third parties. At any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not\nfully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIntentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by\nthird parties, as well as other undesirable, illicit, or high-risk activity on our platform. We are making\nsignificant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts to combat these activities,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. We have\ndiscovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of\nmisuse of user data or other undesirable or illicit activity by third parties. We will not discover all such\nincidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility\nover our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects,\nor other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required\nunder our modified consent order with the FTC, government authorities, the media, or other third parties.\nSuch incidents and activities include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms,\ncontracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper\nadvertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline (such as acts of\nviolence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation,\nchild exploitation, and illegal gaming), instances of spamming, surveillance, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured\ndatasets, or spreading misinformation, or other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity. We may also be\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents.\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to\nour reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse\neffects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and may in the future subject, us\nto additional litigation\n46\nTable of Contents\nand regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and\nattention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties (including open source software), that is highly technical and\ncomplex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to\nstore, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has\ncontained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain\ntechnical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities\ninherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or\ninternal use. For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that\nexploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information\nfrom user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the\nsoftware and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, outcomes including a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and marketers who use our\nproducts, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or\npolicies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised\nability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our\nability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data\nwill be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to\nerrors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition,\nany errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely,\nfailures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or\ninterruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory\ninquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source and other permissive licenses and have\nmade other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open source software in our\nproducts. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our\nAI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions\nand the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or\ninnovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If\nthe protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third\nparties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more\neffectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial results.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other\nintellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a\nsignificant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which\ncould increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other\nrights holders.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that\ncertain of our products and services, trademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We\npresently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and\ndevelop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow.\nDefending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and\nemployees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition,\nplaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such\nlitigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to change or cease some or all of our\noperations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if\nany litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may\nnot be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or\nall of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to\ncontinue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable\nterms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be\nrequired to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or branding or discontinue the practices or\nbranding. The development of alternative non-infringing technology, branding or practices could require significant\neffort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or otherwise negatively affect\nthe user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and\nlitigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2023. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n48\nTable of Contents\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely\naffect our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and\ncertain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate\nmatters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of\nour Class B common stock, including our founder, Board Chair, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of\nall outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude\nyour ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n50\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Cybersecurity\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is\nprone to cybersecurity threats and attacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees.\nWe believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence and scale, the types and volume of\npersonal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and\nservices reach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large\namount of data. In addition, our business and operations span numerous geographies around the world, involve\nthousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on software\nand hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of\npolicies and controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and\nunknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our\nprogram. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and\nindustry-recognized practices, for managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure,\nand corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats, we evaluate a variety of\ndevelopments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory\nrequirements, and observed cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate\nthe maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any\nareas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as\nbenchmarking against industry practices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess\nprivacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to\nassessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent\nassessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting\ncontrol frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity\ncountermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of technical\nand operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our\nthird-party assessment (TPA) process. Under our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who\ncontract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with our systems, in order to help us\nassess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among\nother things, maintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of\nmaterial data breaches that may impact our data.\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity\nrisk management oversight to the audit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight\nCommittee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place\ndesigned to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement processes\nand programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy committee of our board\nof directors (Privacy Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance\nwith our comprehensive privacy program. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material\ncybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk\nexposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight\nCommittee and Privacy Committee.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Guy Rosen leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across\nthe company supporting our security functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are\ncomprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private and public sectors, the technology\nindustry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity,\nsoftware development, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of\nsignificant leadership roles at our company since 2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity\ninitiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPrior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across\ntechnology organizations.\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents\nthrough a variety of technical and operational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the\nsenior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee on the company’s\ncybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\nIn 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our\nefforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not\nexperienced undetected cybersecurity incidents.

          "content": "Legal Proceedings\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to\nnumerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal\nproceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are\nvigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved\nadversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide\nto settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nIn addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or regulatory authorities.\nAny such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability\n(including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or\nrequire us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to\nour products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert\nresources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or\nbehavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the\npast, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of\ncomplex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and\nadvertiser base.\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving\nthe company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are\nfacing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new\nregulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and similar statutes in non-EU\ncountries, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR). We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing\nor contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users,\nparticularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud,\nunlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThis is in addition to significant tax, antitrust, stockholder, and privacy litigation and investigations.\nFurthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial\ndamages awards and fines has increased.\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have\nnot previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be\nvery difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the applicability and amount\nof any fines or penalties. While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can\nbe no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that\nhave not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19,\n2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was\ndismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ), seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay pending\nappeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On\nNovember 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\nMeta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our\nmotion to enjoin and the FTC's motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not\nenjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC could\namend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the\nopportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the\n53\nTable of Contents\nappellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is\nunclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations\nby the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, on\nMay 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard\nContractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in\ncompliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders\nrequiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United\nStates. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the\nIrish High Court. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United\nStates Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional\ncountries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\" under\nSection 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the\nUnited States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for\npersonal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the\n\"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce\npursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the\nadequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we are implementing steps to comply with the above\ncorrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional information, see Part II, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy,\ndata use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\"\nin this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court ( Texas v. Meta Platforms,\nInc. ) alleging that \"tag suggestions\" and other uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture\nor Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking\nstatutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in June 2024.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the California Supreme Court).\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a\npermanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,\nincluding divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion\nto dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been\nfiled in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated\n54\nTable of Contents\nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions.\nOn March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf\nof certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated\ncomplaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the\nEuropean Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use\ndata in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nOn February 6, 2019, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) issued an antitrust injunction order claiming that our\nterms and policies on data sharing across our apps, and collection from third-party websites via our business\ntools, breached European data protection principles and German competition law. We brought a lawsuit seeking to\ninvalidate the order on February 11, 2019. On March 24, 2021, the Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany\nreferred several questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) including certain questions\nregarding interpretation of the GDPR. On July 4, 2023, the CJEU issued a decision which in particular made it more\ndifficult to rely on \"legitimate interests,\" and \"contractual necessity\" as opposed to user \"consent,\" as a legal\nbasis for data processing under the GDPR for ads and personalization purposes.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and\ncosts, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management\nfrom our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint.\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused\n55\nTable of Contents\non those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class actions have been\nfiled in the United States and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school districts,\nmunicipalities and one state in the United States have filed public nuisance claims based on similar allegations.\nOn October 6, 2022, the federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia ( In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). On October 13,\n2023, in In re Social Media Cases , the Los Angeles County Superior Court presiding over the California state court\nproceedings sustained in part and overruled in part our demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims. Beginning in October\n2023, additional U.S. states have filed lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These\nadditional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\n(COPPA) as well as violations of state laws concerning consumer protection, unfair business practices, and products\nliability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices and harms to users under 18 years old. These\nlawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re\nSocial Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country. We are also subject to\ngovernment investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the alleged\nmental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21,\n2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district\ncourt's class certification order, and the court heard argument on September 12, 2023. The case is stayed in the\ndistrict court pending appeal.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\n) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al.,\nwhich was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ) alleging\nthat we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General,\net al. v. Missouri , et al. , on the question of whether federal government officials violated the First Amendment\nin their communications with the company and others related to content moderation practices, and to hear argument\nin Netchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al. , regarding the application of the First\nAmendment relating to content moderation on tech platforms. Although Meta is not a defendant in these actions, the\nSupreme Court's decision and ultimate resolution of the lawsuit could impact our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal\nproceedings and disputes in the future.",

This\nreplaced the ticker symbol 'FB,' which had been used since the company's initial public offering in 2012. Prior to\nthat time, there was no public market for our stock.\nOur Class B common stock is not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any public market.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 3,098 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price\nof our Class A common stock was $353.96 per share as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of\nour shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are\nunable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere were 23 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nDividend Policy\nPrior to 2024, we had never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. On February 1, 2024 we\nannounced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of $0.50 per share of Class A\ncommon stock and Class B common stock (together, the “common stock”) is equivalent to $2.00 per share on an annual\nbasis. The first cash dividend will be paid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close\nof business on February 22, 2024.\nThe payment of future cash dividends is subject to future declaration by our board of directors, which will be\nbased in part on continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our board\nof directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our\nstockholders.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nThe following table summarizes the share repurchase activity for the three months ended December 31, 2023:\nApproximate Dollar\nTotal Number of          Value of Shares\nShares Purchased          that May Yet Be\nas Part of          Purchased Under\nTotal Number of                             Publicly Announced             the Plans or\nShares Purchased       Average Price Paid           Programs(1)              Programs(1)\n(in thousands)             Per Share(2)        (in thousands)            (in millions)\nOctober 1 - 31,                  10,105    $              294.59                10,105    $              34,246\n2023\nNovember 1 - 30,                      —    $                   —                     —    $              34,246\n2023\nDecember 1 - 31,                  9,607    $              345.27                 9,607    $              30,929\n2023\nTotal                            19,712                                         19,712\n____________________________________\n(1) On November 18, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of our\nClass A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In January 2024, an\nadditional $50 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program . The timing and actual number of shares\nrepurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other\ninvestment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange\nAct.

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2023 using 2022 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2023 was\n$134.90 billion, an increase of 16% compared to 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a\nconstant currency basis would have increased 15% compared to 2022. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of\nApps increased 28% year-over-year in 2023, partially offset by a 9% year-over-year decrease in the average price\nper ad.\nIncome from operations for 2023 was $46.75 billion, an increase of $17.81 billion, or 62%, compared to 2022, driven\nby an increase in advertising revenue.\n59\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

On February 1, 2024 we\nannounced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of $0.50 per share of Class A\ncommon stock and Class B common stock (together, the “common stock”) is equivalent to $2.00 per share on an annual\nbasis. The first cash dividend will be paid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close\nof business on February 22, 2024.\n60\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nBeginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and\nstrategic priorities. As of December 31, 2023, we have completed the data center initiatives and the employee\nlayoffs, and substantially completed the facilities consolidation initiatives.\nA summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2023 by\nmajor activity type is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nFacilities         Severance and Other       Data Center Assets       Total\nConsolidation             Personnel Costs\nCost of revenue        $                   177    $                      —    $                -224    $    -47\nResearch and                             1,581                         413                        —       1,994\ndevelopment\nMarketing and sales                        396                         307                        —         703\nGeneral and                                352                         450                        —         802\nadministrative\nTotal                  $                 2,506    $                  1,170    $                -224    $  3,452\nDuring 2023 and 2022, we recognized total pre-tax restructuring charges of $2.84 billion and $4.10 billion under\nour FoA segment, and $612 million and $515 million under our RL segment, respectively.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding restructuring charges.\nFamily of Apps Metrics\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 3.19 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.98 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.11 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.07 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 28% year-over-year in 2023, and the average price\nper ad decreased by 9% year-over-year in 2023.\nBeginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we will no longer\nreport DAUs, MAUs, ARPU, and MAP in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\nintend to begin reporting year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per\nad by geographic region, while continuing to report DAP and ARPP (calculated based on DAP), beginning with our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024. For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDevelopments in Advertising\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on\ntargeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and\nwe expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad\ntargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including\nits evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive,\nthe European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and\nwe expect these and other\n61\nTable of Contents\ndevelopments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user\ndata practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to\nregulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on\nFacebook and Instagram in the EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\"\nand began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with\nregulators on our new consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and\nGoogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and\napplication developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021,\nApple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating\nsystem that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit\nto us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the\nperformance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and\nmeasurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on\nanonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share\ntheir data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More\nbroadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with\nconsumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across\nall of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative\nAI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite\nconversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the\nprivate and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting\nand measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these\nefforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described\nabove will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe\nadvertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and\nrelated market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which\ncould impact our financial results in future periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced\nsome users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our\nproducts, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen\nresults in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes\nat a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for\nthe foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or\nmore regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and\nInstagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued\nto adversely affect user growth and engagement in 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in\n2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have\nperfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex\njudgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the\nglobe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to\nidentify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to\nquantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\n62\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several\nefforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant\nopportunities. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL.\nOur FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of\nour efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI\ninitiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop\nnew products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and\nmixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for\nthe metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of\nour RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the\nmetaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2023, our RL segment reduced our overall operating\nprofit by approximately $16.12 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We\nexpect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts\nis dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we\nbelieve this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses,\ndevelopers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n63\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile\ndevices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n------ DAP/MAP: ------ 79% ------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% --------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% --------\n79% -------- 80%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family\nmetrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nWorldwide DAP increased 8% to 3.19 billion on average during December 2023 from 2.96 billion during December 2022.\n64\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP.

For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family\nmetrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 3.98 billion MAP, an increase of 6% from 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $9.39    $7.72         $7.91    $7.53    $8.63             $7.59    $8.32    $8.71    $10.10\nAd Revenue                      Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using\nour Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources. Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we intend to report ARPP based on DAP instead of MAP.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $34.72, an\nincrease of 9% from 2022.\n66\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of\nour daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\n----\nDAU/MAU: -- 66% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 67% ------ 68% ------ 68% ----- 68% ------ 69% -\n- -\nDAU/MAU: -- 74% ----- 75% ------ 75% ------ 74% ------ 75% ----- 74% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ---- DAU/MAU:\n- 72% ------ 73% ------ 74% ----- 74% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ------ 75% ---\n- -\nDAU/MAU: -- 63% ----- 64% ------ 64% ------ 64% ------ 65% ----- 66% ------ 66% ------ 66% ------ 67% ---- DAU/MAU:\n- 65% ------ 66% ------ 66% ----- 66% ------ 66% ------ 67% ------ 66% ------ 67% ------ 67% ---\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n67\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 6% to 2.11 billion on aver age during December 2023 from 2.00 billion during December 2022\n. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2023, relative to the same period in 2022.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 3.07 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from December 31, 2022. Users in India,\nBangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.\n68\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\n--- ARPU: -- $11.57 --- $9.54 --- $9.82 --- $9.41 --- $10.86 ---- $9.62 ---- $10.63 ---- $11.23 --- $13.12 -\n-\n-- ARPU: -- $60.57 -- $48.29 -- $50.25 -- $49.13 --- $58.77 -- $48.85 --- $53.53 --- $56.11 --- $68.44 --------\nARPU: -- $19.68 -- $15.35 -- $15.64 -- $14.23 -- $17.29 --- $15.51 -- $17.88 --- $19.04 --- $23.14\n- ARPU: -- $4.89 ---- $4.47 ---- $4.54 ---- $4.42 ---- $4.61 ---- $4.52 ---- $4.88 ----- $5.12 ---- $5.52 -------\nARPU: -- $3.43 ----- $3.14 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.21 ---- $3.52 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.76 ----- $4.22 ---- $4.50\nAd Revenue    Non-Ad Revenue\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using\nour Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\n69\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $44.60, an\nincrease of 13% from 2022. For 2023, ARPU increased by 21% in Europe, 20% in Rest of World, 11% in Asia-Pacific,\nand 10% in United States & Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as\nAsia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those\nregions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative\nto ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each\ngeographic region.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting\nestimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes\nof the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the\nestimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when\napplicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider\nthese to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting\npolicies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions\nare finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other\nfactors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in future quarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 15 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income\n(loss) before\n71\nTable of Contents\nprovision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required\nin determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation\ncorroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that\nwe have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide\nno assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment\nis required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment\nand assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and\ncompanies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets,\noccurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable\ncompared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual\ndisposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the\ncarrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair\nvalue.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for\nusing the measurement alternative, is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering\nevents for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's\nfinancial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological\nenvironment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee.\nWhen indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the\nmarket approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income\nif the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity\nsecurities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-\nmarketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations\nassociated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion\nfeatures, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and\nobligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of\nobservable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment\nfor these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\n72\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad\nproducts either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number\nof impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are\nnot currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or\ndecrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate\naverage price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average\nprice paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising\nrevenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from\ndevelopers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our\nproducts. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist\nof cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, RL technology development costs, facilities-related costs for employees on our\nengineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing\nproducts, and restructuring charges.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mainly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also\ninclude professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations and\nrestructuring charges.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which\ninclude estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives\nas well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative\nemployees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; professional services\nand restructuring charges.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022.

The increase was almost entirely driven by\nadvertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2023 increased $18.31 billion, or 16%, compared to 2022 due to an increase in the number of\nads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad. In 2023, the number of ads delivered\nincreased by 28%, as compared with an 18% increase in 2022 as ads impressions grew in all regions during 2023,\nespecially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 2023 was driven by increases\nin the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. In 2023, the average\nprice per ad decreased by 9%, as compared with a decrease of 16% in 2022. The decrease in average price per ad was\ndriven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels,\nthat monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined year-over-year, we believe the improvements\nto our ad targeting and measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand.\nOther factors are also discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results.\" In\naddition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth for the full year 2023 was driven mainly by marketer spending\nin online commerce, which benefited from marketers based in China, consumer packaged goods, and entertainment and\nmedia. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads\ndelivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2023 increased $250 million, or 31%, compared to 2022. The increase was mainly driven by\nWhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2023 decreased $263 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. The decrease in RL revenue was mostly driven\nby a net decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 17%, 16%, and\n16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021 declined 11%, 17%, and 7% compared to the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020\nrespectively.\n75\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue in the full year 2023 compared to the\nsame period in 2022. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange\nrates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising\nrevenue would have been $134.53 billion and $131.57 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $374 million and $379 million lower than actual total revenue and\nadvertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2023. Using the same constant rates, full year 2023 total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $17.92 billion and $17.93 billion higher than actual total revenue\nand advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                       2023 vs 2022 %       2022 vs 2021 %\n2023            2022            2021               change               change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nCost of          $          25,959       $  25,249       $  22,649                    3  %                11  %\nrevenue\nPercentage of                   19  %           22  %           19  %\nrevenue\nCost of revenue in 2023 increased $710 million, or 3%, compared to 2022.

This was partially offset by a decrease in the proportion of\nU.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income relative to income before provision for income taxes and\nadditional clarification issued by the IRS in September 2023 regarding research and development expenses subject to\nmandatory capitalization and amortization.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not\nexpected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our\nbusiness, and the effects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 26,\n2024 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be\nin the mid-teens. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory\ncapitalization requirement increased our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax\nrate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is\ndeferred, our effective tax rate in 2024 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities\ncould be lower.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits . As of December 31, 2023, we had net uncertain tax positions of $6.95 billion which were\naccrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related\nto transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing\nservices and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax\ncredits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or\nevents that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described\nbelow and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such\namounts within the next 12 months.\nSee Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n78\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from\noperations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time\ndeposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt\nsecurities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions\nand our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable\nsecurities were $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.67 billion from December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was mostly due to $71.11 billion of cash generated from operations, and $8.46 billion of net proceeds from\nthe issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by\n$28.10 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $19.77 billion for\nrepurchases of our Class A common stock, and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nemployee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   71,113    $   50,475    $   57,683\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                  -24,495    $  -28,970    $   -7,570\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -19,500    $  -22,136    $  -50,728\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $39.10 billion net income adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, such as $14.03 billion of share-based compensation expense and $11.18 billion of\ndepreciation and amortization expense, as well as $3.29 billion of favorable changes in working capital. The\nincrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly du e to an increase in\ncash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, and a decrease in payments to our vendors.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $27.05 billion of net purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.20\nbillion net proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. The decrease in cash used in\ninvesting activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to a decrease in purchases of property and\nequipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $37 billion in 2024.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $19.77 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $8.46\nbillion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities\nduring 2023 compared to 2022 was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock,\npartially offset by an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee RSU awards and a decrease\nin net proceeds from our debt offerings.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\n79\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nNet cash provided by operating              $                   71,113    $   50,475    $   57,683\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment, net                       -27,045       -31,186       -18,567\nPrincipal payments on finance leases                            -1,058          -850          -677\nFree cash flow                              $                   43,010    $   18,439    $   38,439\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be\nsufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchases and dividend payments for at least the\nnext 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital\nresources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include offices, data centers, and colocations. Our finance lease\nobligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not\nmaterially change our operating lease obligations.\nOur contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and\nconsumer hardware products in Reality Labs.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $18.50 billion. These notes were issued in multiple series, which mature from 2027 through\n2063. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2023 are $848 million and\n$16.40 billion, respectively. Net proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, which may\ninclude, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or\ninvestments.\n80\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 92 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $20.03 billion, which includes the 1% excise tax\naccruals as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $30.93 billion remained\navailable and authorized for repurchases. In January 2024, an additional $50 billion of repurchases was authorized\nunder this program.\nDividend\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of\n$0.50 per share of common stock is equivalent to $2.00 per share on an annual basis. The first cash dividend will\nbe paid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2024.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to\ncontinue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The\ndeclaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into\naccount various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and\nanticipated cash needs.\nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $6.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ntaxes payable of $1.14 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of\nwhich $575 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual\ninterest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $6.95 billion related to the uncertain\ntax positions as of December 31, 2023. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the\ntiming of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate\nof the timing of payments.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, Note 13 — Stockholders'\nEquity, and Note 15 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item\n8, and \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation regarding leases and contractual commitments, debt, taxes, and contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n81\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprice risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other\nthan the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into,\nbut in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $366 million, $81 million, and $140 million were recognized in\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash\nequivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements.\nChanges in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nand the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would\nhave resulted in a decrease of $355 million and $558 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt\nsecurities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Any realized gains or losses\nresulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we\nsold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes)\noutstanding of $18.50 billion and $10.00 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and\nare carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing\nin periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\n82\nTable of Contents\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments are in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could\nhave a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available\nmarket data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could\nadversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or\ndownward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists of our\ninvestment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6.14 billion and $6.20 billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Financial\nInstruments, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, and Note 10 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and\nPart II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical\nAccounting Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n83\nTable of Contents",

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n85\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nOur audit procedures included reading the minutes or a summary of\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, reading\nthe proceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries\nand investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate,\nrequesting and receiving internal and external legal counsel\nconfirmation letters, meeting with internal and external legal\ncounsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtaining\nrepresentations from management. We also evaluated the\nappropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 12 to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\n86\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2024\n87\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the\nCompany) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Financial Statements.\n94\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring\nthe world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the\nmetaverse to life.\nWe report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to loss contingencies,\nincome taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS)\ndebt securities and accounts receivable, and fair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are\nbased on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions\nwe may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers .\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is\none year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We\ndo not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of\none year or less.\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\nmobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising\n95\nTable of Contents\nrevenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our\ncontrol is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our\ncustomers.\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and\nreport revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider\nif we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as\nother indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in\nestablishing price.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which\nis generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in\nexchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These\nmainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of\nproducts sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee,\nor both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if\nthe capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not\nmaterial to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners\nbased on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs\nare included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for\ncapitalization were not material to date.\n96\nTable of Contents\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.02billion, $ 2.65billion, and $ 2.99billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nEmployee Severance\nWe recognize one-time employee termination costs when notification occurs, based on the regional requirements in\nwhich the employee works.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid\ninvestments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from\ncustomer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining\nunrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders'\nequity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not\nmaterial. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific\n97\nTable of Contents\nidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting primarily of cash related to insurance policies, and\nretention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and\nother assets on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We\nperiodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated\nfair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write down the investment to fair value. The change in\ncarrying value, if any, gains and losses resulting from the remeasurements are recognized in interest and other\nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-\nmarketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models\nutilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to\ndevelop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions\noccur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and\n98\nTable of Contents\nallowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience,\nthe age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability\nto collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our\nconsolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowances for accounts receivable were\nimmaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the\nremaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets are described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           FourtoFive years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. Additionally, we recorded abandonment charges and its\nrelated adjustments in 2023 and 2022 for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under ASC Topic 360\nrelated to our restructuring efforts. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 —\nRestructuring.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining\ncarrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated\nuseful life.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within CIP are not depreciated. CIP is related to the construction or\ndevelopment of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We\ncapitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the\nrelated assets.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale\nor disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain offices, data centers, and colocations. We also have finance leases\nfor certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases\ncontain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities,\nreal estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common\narea maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price\nIndex, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and\nutilities. Such variable lease costs are\n99\nTable of Contents\nexpensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease\nterm unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 , we recorded net impairment losses of $ 2.43billion and $\n2.22billion in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of\nour facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The\nassumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future\nsubleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of\nrisk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts,\nsee Note 3 — Restructuring.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\nrecord such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and disclose the\npossible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair\nvalue of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as\ngoodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase\nconsideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived\nintangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\n100\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill\nimpairment testing. As of December 31, 2023, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax of $ 1.24billion and $ 1.86billion,\nrespectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 366million, $\n81million, and $ 140million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly\nof money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities\nconsist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large\nfinancial institutions and our marketable securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our\ninvestment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The\namount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 was not material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 37%, 40%, and 41% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the\nrevenue outside of the United States in 2023 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil,\nAustralia, Canada and Japan.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\n101\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn April 1, 2023 we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control\nArrangements (ASU 2023-01), which requires leasehold improvements associated with common control leases to be\namortized over the useful life to the common control group. The adoption of this new standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires an enhanced disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for the annual periods\nbeginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is\npermitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n(ASU 2023-09), which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and\ngreater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated\nby jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures.\nThis guidance will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. Early adoption\nis permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the\nadoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n102\nTable of Contents\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nAdvertising       $                  131,948    $  113,642    $  114,934\nOther revenue                          1,058           808           721\nFamily of Apps                       133,006       114,450       115,655\nReality Labs                           1,896         2,159         2,274\nTotal revenue     $                  134,902    $  116,609    $  117,929\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers, consists of the following (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023          2022          2021\nUnited States and Canada(1)    $                   52,888    $   50,150    $   51,541\nEurope(3)                                          31,210        26,681        29,057\nAsia-Pacific(2)                                    36,154        27,760        26,739\nRest of World(3)                                   14,650        12,018        10,592\nTotal revenue                  $                  134,902    $  116,609    $  117,929\n_________________________\n(1) United States revenue was $ 49.78billion, $ 47.20billion, and $ 48.38billion for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n(2) China revenue was $ 13.69billion, $ 7.40billion, and $ 7.59billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\n(3) Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\nOur total deferred revenue was $ 675million and $ 526million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Impacted\nemployees in our recruiting, technology, and business groups were notified during March 2023 to May 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have completed these employee layoffs. In certain regions, a small portion of the impacted\nemployees continue to be included in our reported headcount through 2024. We recognized $ 1.20billion pre-tax\nseverance and related personnel costs across the FoA and RL segments during the year ended December 31, 2023 in\naccordance with ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , where applicable.\nA summary of our 2023 Restructuring pre-tax charges, including subsequent adjustments, recorded for severance and\nrelated personnel costs during the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nResearch and development      $                           422\nMarketing and sales                                       308\nGeneral and administrative                                467\nTotal(1)                      $                         1,197\n____________________________\n(1) Includes $ 101million of share-based compensation expense recognized for the 2023 layoffs during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe 2023 Restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $ 1.10billion and RL segment were $ 96million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of changes in the accrued severance and other personnel liabilities related to the 2023\nlayoff activities, included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets (in millions):\nSeverance Liabilities\nBalance as of January 1, 2023                                 —\nSeverance and other personnel costs                       1,097\nCash payments                                            -1,021\nBalance as of December 31, 2023        $                     76\n2022 Restructuring\nIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic\npriorities. These measures included a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon\nseveral office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000employees across the FoA and RL\nsegments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center\nprojects (the 2022 Restructuring).

As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of\ndilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under our Equity Incentive Plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 16million and 95million shares of Class A common\nstock equivalents of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would\nhave an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2023                     2022                     2021\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,722    $  5,376    $  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,220         354        2,285         402        2,383         432\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                   15.19    $  15.19    $    8.63    $   8.63    $   13.99    $  13.99\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,722    $  5,376    $  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            5,376           —        3,471           —        6,042           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —        -112            —         -19            —         -93\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  39,098    $  5,264    $  23,200    $  3,452    $  39,370    $  5,949\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,220         354        2,285         402        2,383         432\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           354           —          402           —          432           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             55           —           15           —           44           —\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,629         354        2,702         402        2,859         432\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                   14.87    $  14.87    $    8.59    $   8.59    $   13.77    $  13.77\n106\nTable of Contents\nNote 5.\nFinancial Instruments\nInstruments Measured at Fair Value\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted\nmarket prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair\nvalue.

The\nfollowing is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\n2024          $  12,105\n2025              1,152\n2026                417\n2027                218\n2028                127\nThereafter        2,470\nTotal         $  16,489\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components\nthat do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. We enter into these agreements in order to secure either\nvolume or price. Using the expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend related to our renewable energy\nagreements as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $ 15.12billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years.\nThe ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on actual volume purchased.\n115\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Related Matters\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be\nuncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to\ncomply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these\nother legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters,\nasserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we\nbelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of\nlosses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 — Income Taxes.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United\nStates and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that\nshared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection,\nprivacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in\nthe United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the\nparties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725million by\nus. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain\nof our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.\nDerivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10,\n2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was\ndenied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims.\n116\nTable of Contents\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking\nsubstantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and\ninclude, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the\ncomposition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new\nproducts. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v.\nFacebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent\norder. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding\npending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay pending\nappeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On\nNovember 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\nMeta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to\npreliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed\nan opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our\nmotion to enjoin and the FTC’s motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not\nenjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC could\namend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the\nopportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the\nenforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the\nrequest for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta\nPlatforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €\n1.2billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I,\nItem 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's cooperation and consistency\nmechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance,\nare subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have\naccrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be\nmaterial individually or in the aggregate.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court ( Texas v. Meta Platforms,\nInc. ) alleging that \"tag suggestions\" and other uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture\nor Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking\nstatutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in June 2024.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly\nreceived individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our\nterms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re\nMeta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor,\nInc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the California Supreme Court).\nCompetition\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\n2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC, and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of\n117\nTable of Contents\nthe Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on\naccess to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the\nantitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On\nJune 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On\nAugust 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this\namended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint.\nMultiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the\nUnited Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these\nacquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of\nthe cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On January 14,\n2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1,\n2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain\nadvertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint\nfiled in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the European\nCommission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook,\nInc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and\nuser data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the\nplaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their\ncase, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in\npart and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. Ohio Pub.\nEmpl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages ( Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court\ndismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint.\nYouth-Related Actions\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users, with most\nproceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class\nactions have been filed in the United States and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous\nschool districts, municipalities, and onestate in the United States have filed public nuisance claims based on\nsimilar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( In re Social Media Adolescent\n118\nTable of Contents\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). On October 13, 2023, in In re Social Media Cases , the\nLos Angeles County Superior Court presiding over the California state court proceedings sustained in part and\noverruled in part our demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims. Beginning in October 2023, additional U.S. states have\nfiled lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations\nregarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) as well as violations of state laws\nconcerning consumer protection, unfair business practices, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our\nalleged business practices and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive\nrelief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as\nwell as various state courts around the country. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from\nmultiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety\nimpacts on users, particularly younger users.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve\nv. Facebook, Inc. ) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and\n2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition\nclaims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21,\n2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district\ncourt's class certification order, and the court heard argument on September 12, 2023. The case is stayed in the\ndistrict court pending appeal.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\n) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al.)\n, which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) alleging\nthat we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2023, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2023.\n119\nTable of Contents\nNote 13.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each\nshare of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is\nentitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our\nClass A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial\nstatements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 2,211million shares of Class A common stock and 350million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nCapital Return Program\nShare Repurchase\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, $ 10.87billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2023, an additional $ 40billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program. In 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 92million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate amount of $ 20.03billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $ 30.93billion remained available and authorized for\nrepurchases. In January 2024, an additional $ 50billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDividend\nOn February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. This cash dividend of $\n0.50per share of common stock is equivalent to $ 2.00per share on an annual basis. The first cash dividend will be\npaid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2024.\nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to\ncontinue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future\ndividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including\nour financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which\nwas amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022.

We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 490million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 4.08billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization.

During all years presented, we recognized interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated\nstatements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $\n1.48billion, $ 1.07billion, and $ 960million respectively.\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 11.67billion as of December 31, 2023 were realized in a future period,\nthis would result in a tax benefit of $ 7.33billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax years. Our 2014 through 2016 tax\nyears are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in\nAugust 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2023, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional\ntax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n124\nTable of Contents\nNote 16.

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\nand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nour management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs.",
