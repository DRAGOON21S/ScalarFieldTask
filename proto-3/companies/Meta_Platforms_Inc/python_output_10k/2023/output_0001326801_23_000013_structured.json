          "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build\ntechnology that helps people connect and share, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers,\nvirtual reality headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world\naround them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with\naudiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected\neverywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences\nlike augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology. Our vision for the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of\nexperiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we\nbelieve it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is\nreflected in FoA. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives,\nsuch as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including\non Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL reflects our efforts to develop\nthe metaverse and generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities, and the majority of our investments are directed toward\ndeveloping our family of apps. In 2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were\nrecognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $71.79 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount, data\ncenters and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We\nare also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented\nreality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the\nmetaverse. Our total RL investments were $15.88 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount and\ntechnology development across these efforts. As these are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve\nas the metaverse ecosystem develops, many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next decade.\nAlthough it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL\nsegment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse\nefforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a\ncomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of\nthe internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\nFamily of Apps Products\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups,\nand more.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through\nphotos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ncommunities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio and video calls.\n7\nT able of Contents\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nReality Labs Products\nMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products\nthat are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new\ntechnologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using\nneuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and hardware to help build next-\ngeneration interfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality\nLabs' augmented and virtual reality products that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere. Our current\nproduct offerings include Meta Quest virtual reality devices, as well as software and content available through the\nMeta Quest Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance, including\ngaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, we have launched Horizon Worlds, a social platform where\npeople can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events, and Horizon Workrooms, a\nvirtual reality space for teams to connect and collaborate at work. As part of our virtual reality initiatives, we\nhave also introduced mixed reality capabilities through our Meta Reality system on Meta Quest Pro, which allows\nusers to experience the immersion and presence of virtual reality while still being grounded in the physical world.\nAs part of our augmented reality initiatives, we have introduced Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which let people\nstay more present through hands-free interaction, and Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to\nbuild augmented reality experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps. In general,\nwhile all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our virtual\nreality and social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and\nservices to go to market, whereas our augmented reality efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research\nand development projects. For example, in 2023, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating\nexpenses on our augmented reality initiatives, approximately 40% on our virtual reality initiatives, and\napproximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this\nexpense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to\nchange, including as the metaverse ecosystem and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly\nevaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and\ndiscover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We\ncompete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our\nfree or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\nhardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our\nexisting products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts\nto develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as AI, we may become subject\nto additional competition.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and virtual reality\nincreases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We make\nsignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones,\nas well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and\nintegrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse.\nAcross all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI and machine learning, including to\nrecommend relevant unconnected content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, to enhance our\nadvertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and\n8\nT able of Contents\nto develop new product features using generative AI.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence.\nWe also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property,\nadvertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications,\ncompetition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product\nliability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and\npolitical law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy,\ncontent, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or\npenalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result,\nthe application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in\nthe new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or\nlegislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content,\nor obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products,\ncould adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to\nreview a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various\nefforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any\nsuch changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or\noperations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services,\n9\nT able of Contents\nit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to\ntarget ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer\nframework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July\n2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to\ntransfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial\nscrutiny. On July 6, 2022, we received a draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European Union/European\nEconomic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and\npreliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had\nreached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022,\nPresident Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\nActivities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the\nproposed new EU-U.S. DPF. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of\n2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision is adopted by the European\nCommission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers\nfrom the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional\nchanges in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European\nUnion privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification\nobligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and\ndraft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of\nthe GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such\ninvestigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount\nof penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom,\nand other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on\nproducts and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish\ncertain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. In addition, the European Union's\nePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future\nadversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently\nenacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other\njurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the\nDigital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours,\nincluding in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design.\nThe DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable\nagainst designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant\ncompliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA\nwill likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital\nServices Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will impose new\nrestrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our compliance costs.\nThe DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and\nTurkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local\nstorage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering\nour services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result in fines\nor other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use\ninformation about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including with respect to minors, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil\n10\nT able of Contents\nrights, content moderation, and competition. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory\norders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive\nprivacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory\nauthorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including\nliability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to\nchange our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or\nuser data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and\nattention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\naffect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People are\nat the heart of every connection we empower, and we are proud of our unique company culture. We strive to build\ndiverse teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.\nAs we look forward, we expect the lasting effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic will change how we work and who\nwe reach. We are proud of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic both internally and externally. Employee benefits\nwere robust and established quickly: we implemented 15 days of subsidized backup care for child, adult, or\neldercare; we paid emergency leave to help address short-term or transitional needs; and we established a temporary\nstipend to help employees work from home, to name just a few of the benefits.\nWe are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our global workforce, and we are focused on supporting\nour people in doing the best work of their careers, no matter where they are located. For example:\nLocation is flexible but presence is essential. As of September 30, 2022, 83% of managers at Meta had direct\nreports in a different location, and 24% of our employees were fully remote.\nRemote work has helped us reach new talent in a competitive tech landscape and broaden our representation. We\nhave seen that candidates who accepted remote job offers were more often underrepresented people.\nBeginning March 2023, we are permitting employees in eligible roles to transfer to any Meta office within their\ncountry of employment. We expect distributed teams to establish strong norms that support efficiency, including\nmore predictable and coordinated in-person working time.\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of online commerce led to\naccelerated revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even\nafter the pandemic ended. Instead, not only did online commerce return to prior trends, but the more challenging\nmacroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools, among other factors,\ncontributed to a decline in our revenue.\nTo address this new environment, we took a number of steps to become a more capital efficient company and, in\nNovember 2022, made one of the most difficult changes in Meta's history and announced a layoff of approximately\n11,000 employees. The cost reduction efforts that we announced, including our plans to scale back budgets, reduce\ncompany perks, shrink our real estate footprint, and restructure teams to increase efficiency alone would not bring\nour expenses in line with our revenue growth and we had to implement the layoff. We made it a priority to treat\noutgoing employees with respect and announced a package for U.S. employees that included:\nSeverance: 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service.\nPaid time off: payment for all remaining paid time off.\n11\nT able of Contents\nRestricted stock unit vesting: receipt of November 2022 vesting for outstanding employee restricted stock unit\nawards.\nHealth insurance: coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months.\nCareer services: three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished\njob leads.\nImmigration support: dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their needs.\nWe offered similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States, taking into account local\nemployment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled and efficient workforce. In addition to permitting\nemployees to seek education reimbursement, we offer career development opportunities and work experience programs\nthat extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we utilize various learning modalities, such as\nlive virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning\ncommunities, and coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help understand how employees feel about working at Meta and\nwhat we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, and personal experience\nover time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random\nsample of employees, allows us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company changes. These\nsurveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the\ncompany.\nHealth and Well-being\nMeta's health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them\nreach their personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health,\ncreate financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community. Programs\nare designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being,\nand mental health programs, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees and their dependents.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to\nbuild the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\nWe offer full-time fully remote positions, including in locations where we do not have offices, which has deepened\nthe diversity of our candidate pool. As published in our Diversity Report in July 2022, we saw that providing\nremote optionality increased the diversity of the overall composition of our workforce: U.S candidates who accepted\nremote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific\nIslander, veterans and/or people with disabilities, and globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were\nmore likely to be women.\nAs part of our 2022 Diversity Report, we published our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce\ndata. As of June 30, 2022, our global employee base was comprised of 37.1% females and 62.9% males, and our U.S.\nemployee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 46.5% Asian, 37.6% White, 6.7% Hispanic, 4.9% Black, 4.0%\ntwo or more ethnicities, and 0.3% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian\nor Other Pacific Islander).\nWe want our products to work for the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. To aid\nin this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias from our hiring processes and performance management systems.\n12\nT able of Contents\nWe have also invested in learning opportunities to identify and reduce inherent bias through Diversity, Equity and\nInclusion trainings for our employees and enhanced learning and development courses. In addition, we offer career\ndevelopment programs to employees, including opportunities for women leaders at Meta to connect, support and grow\ntogether and programs to help ensure that we develop leaders of color, build a more diverse leadership pipeline and\nfoster a culture of sponsorship through leader advocacy.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2022, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United\nStates for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their dependents with resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement\nsavings plans, access to tax and legal services, and Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nour ability to compete effectively;\nfluctuations in our financial results;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n14\nT able of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding,\nretaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and\nInstagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our\nactive user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher\npenetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive\nproducts and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as\nwell as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19\npandemic has led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to\nperiod at different points during the pandemic, and may continue to have a varied impact on the size and engagement\nof our active user base in the future. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and\nInstagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which\ncontributed to slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs and MAUs on Facebook in Europe\nin the first quarter and the second quarter of 2022, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in\nthe total number of MAUs on Facebook in the second quarter of 2022. Any future declines in the size of our active\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services. Any\nnumber of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\n15\nT able of Contents\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we\nrely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Privacy\nRights Act (CPRA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content, or\nusers feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our\nplatform;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different\nproducts and services across our family of products;\n16\nT able of Contents\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of new technologies such as\nartificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors,\nor other third parties, or otherwise;\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user\ngrowth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment);\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for\nour users to interact and share on third-party applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order\nto grow revenue.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to\ndo business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a\ncompetitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce\nour ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely\naffect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\ndemand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\n17\nT able of Contents\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nadverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to\nadvertising, including developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nsuch as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or\nmessaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our\nreliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\napplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or\npotential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations;\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA),\nother laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for\nadvertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\n18\nT able of Contents\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies (for example, the war in Ukraine and service\nrestrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other\nregions).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to\nimpact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\nnot control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to\nour users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example,\nlegislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and California Consumer Privacy Act\n(CCPA), as amended by the CPRA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such\nsignals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain\ntypes of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in\nCalifornia following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance, decisions, or new legislation in these or other\njurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, we expect to\nimplement additional changes in response to the December 2022 decision by the IDPC regarding the legal basis for\nour delivery of behavioral advertising in Europe.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and\nuse these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS\ndevelopers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue\nto negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising\nplatforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the\nability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services,\nincluding changes implemented in connection with the GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and\nnegatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by\nmarketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are\nunable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement\ncapabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising\nrevenue.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in\nthe past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our\nability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our\nability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our\nproducts or our delivery of ads have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect,\n19\nT able of Contents\nthe usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to\nits Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most\nrelevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to\ntarget and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. We expect that any similar\nchanges to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure\nthe effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products,\nit is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and\nstandards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers,\nand browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants\nin the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products,\nsystems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our\nproducts on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices\nor use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be\nharmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of\nour business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our\nusers and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers,\nbrowser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will\nresult in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions\nor if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be\nadversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such\noccurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices,\nwhich may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. We are also making significant\ninvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, and develop new product features using generative AI. These efforts,\nincluding the introduction of new products or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest,\nsignificant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have\nhistorically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate\nmeaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to\nimplement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well as facilitate cross-app communication\nbetween these platforms, which are subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If\nour new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business\nplans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin,\nor other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking\nalgorithms or other product features to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and\n20\nT able of Contents\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we\nexpect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of\npublishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.\nWe also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products,\nthat attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization,\nsuch as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products,\nfrom time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products\nand services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as\nour feed or Stories products. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may\nnot produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will b e a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\ninfrastructure as well as pri vacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies,\ndevelopers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our\nexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We\nregularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological\nchallenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have limited experience\nwith consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other companies to\ncompete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including\nif we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate\neffectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also\ndivert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make\nsignificant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our\nability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In\naddition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations\nin the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, competition,\ncontent regulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products\nand services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm\nour business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not be successful\nin the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if\nusers do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting\nwith parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or\nregulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product\ndesign, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with\nelections, the COVID-19 pandemic, or geopolitical events, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the\nfuture adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject\nof media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of\ninternal company documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and\ncontent enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user\nwell-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in\n21\nT able of Contents\nviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of\nobjectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise\nenforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in\nour brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or\ninappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of\nour products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate\nopinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related\npurposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or\nobjectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic, geopolitical events, or elections\nin the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from\nthe independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our\nproducts or services on user well-being, or by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend\nparticipation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.\nCertain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our\nhandling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues,\nhave eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully promote\nand maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be\nadversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that\nintegrate with our products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications\nthat integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building,\ngrowing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose\nto build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that\nintegrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers\nwith our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that\ncontinues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce\nthe volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the\nuser experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization\nopportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to\nprivacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some\ninstances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we\nare unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create,\nshare, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or\nprospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain\nbusinesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who\nbuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and\ndeliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new\nproducts, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as\npart of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as artificial\nintelligence, we may become subject to additional competition.\n22\nT able of Contents\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly\nengage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics\nor more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit\nour ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively.\nAs a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other\nrevenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In\naddition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that\nthese actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our\nproducts;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\n23\nT able of Contents\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or\nmeasure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such\nas Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\n24\nT able of Contents\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs

governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\n25\nT able of Contents\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-\nmarketable equity securities, and in interest rates;\nthe incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, including as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity,\ngovernment surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are\nintegrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance\nor enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or\nservices on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to\nthese topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of\nallegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may\nin the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit\nor objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical\nevents, and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse\neffect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products,\nwhich could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have\nexperienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our\nadvertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\nWe are subject to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has previously significantly impacted,\nand may in the future impact, our business and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted\nin authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of\nthe virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-\nplace orders, which have previously caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain\naffected countries and regions. These developments led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\nadvertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the\nfuture. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our business, operations, and\nworkforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\n26\nT able of Contents\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in\nlight of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives,\nand some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to\nreduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part\nof our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant\ninvestments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin\nand profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately\n$13.72 billion, and we expect our investments to increase in the future. If our investments are not successful\nlonger-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2022, the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority directed us to divest our Giphy acquisition. In addition, in 2022, the FTC filed lawsuits against\nus to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies and\npotential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic\ninvestments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in\nincreased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions\nand we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses,\nadversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions\nor other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or\ninvestors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions\n27\nT able of Contents\nmay also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of\nsubstantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely\naffect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our\nacquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing\noperating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and\nadversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\nperformance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a\ncombination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the\namount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from\nearthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict,\nother physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in\ncertain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may\nresult in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical\ninfrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our\nfinancial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to\nmaintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue\nto experience, supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical\ninfrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, and in the future we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs,\nor we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\n28\nT able of Contents\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of\nthese projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or\navailability of components, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other\ngeopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or\notherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or\ndegradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In\naddition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of\ndesign and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying\nequipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical\ninfrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such\ngovernment action, has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our\ntechnical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products\nand lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition,\nwe are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to\nimprovements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can\nresult in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted\nby data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We\ngenerally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that\nare within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates,\n29\nT able of Contents\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may\nindicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family\nmetrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as\nour methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes,\nor other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such\nevolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the\nstability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our\nmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate\na broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it\nis possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\n30\nT able of Contents\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 4-5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our\nestimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer,\nregulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers,\nor investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in\nour metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and\ndevelopers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions,\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The\nscale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other\nthird parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the\nscale and complexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant\nexperience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage our scale\neffectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial,\nand management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our\npersonnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In\naddition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees\nand initiated several measures to scale down our office facilities. As our organization continues to evolve, and we\nare required to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to\nmaintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and\ninnovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages,\n31\nT able of Contents\nand we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international markets\nwhere we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available\nin China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage,\nor oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a\nvariety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and\npandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\n32\nT able of Contents\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in\nlogistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product\ndevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse\nchanges in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and\nsale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs,\nor supply chain or logistics disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety,\nthe environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them\nviolates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or\nstandards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions,\ngovernment action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced,\ncurrently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to\nadvertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, user well-being, employment, activities\non our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer\nhardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example,\nwe are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data\npractices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\n33\nT able of Contents\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our\nacquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's\nallegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience\nsize for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of\nmultiple lawsuits related to our alleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content. The results of\nany such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits\ncould result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or\nbusiness practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\n34\nT able of Contents\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than\n140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.\nAs this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and\nultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and\nseveral countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under\nwhich we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For\nexample, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include\nbusiness activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation\nvesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2022, tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation increased our provision for\nincome taxes by $471 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such shortfalls. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the\nshare-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and\nvalue of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the\nmagnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on\nour stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our\neffective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results\nof operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg.\nAlthough we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg, the agreement has no specific duration\nand constitutes at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our\nbusiness by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering,\nproduct development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n35\nT able of Contents\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our\ncompetitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring technical\npersonnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other\nfactors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to\nattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based\ncompensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition,\nrestrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect\nour efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel . If we do not succeed in\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or\nprevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our\nother stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential\ninvestor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common\nstock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to\ncontrol the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death,\nthe shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has\ndesignated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in\ngood faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder,\neven a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting\ncontrol as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides\nauthorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend\n36\nT able of Contents\nuser services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted.\nIn addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong\nKong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be\nadversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to\nFacebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government,\nwhich has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is\npossible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising\nrevenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or\ninformation requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as\nimposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found\nto be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish\ngovernment could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely\nimpact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to\ncensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors\nare able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets\nthat we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user\nengagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or\ngrow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights\nof publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data\nretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection,\ncivil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade\ncontrols including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online\npayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other\nactions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition,\nforeign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can\nimpose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result,\nthe application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in\nthe new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or\nlegislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content,\nor obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect\nthe manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on\n37\nT able of Contents\nSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a\npreliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on\nSCCs in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the\nGDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers should therefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a\nrevised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers\nshould be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision was then further refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other\nEuropean data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism. Separately, on March 25,\n2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on\nEnhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the\nEuropean Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF. On January 19, 2023, the\nIDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), pursuant to the dispute\nresolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus could\nnot be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as\nearly as the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision\nis adopted by the European Commission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative\nmeans of data transfers from the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of\nour most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have been managing\ninvestigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the 2016 and 2021 updates to\nWhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and\nservices, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer\ndata between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among\nour products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection\nregulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights\nAct (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including\nlimitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes\nfor which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive\nprivacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are\nevolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of\nadvertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our\nadvertising business. For example, state regulators in California and Colorado are considering adopting regulations\nthat could further limit how companies can use personal information for advertising purposes. In Europe, regulators\ncontinue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and\nsimilar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such\ntechnologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on\nthe use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our\nproducts or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected,\nand may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative\nproposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level,\nas well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.\nFor example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours,\nincluding in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design.\nThe DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable\nagainst designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant\ncompliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA\nwill likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to\n38\nT able of Contents\nmodify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the\nDigital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will\nimpose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our\ncompliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such\nas India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity\nof delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or\nresult in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect\nand use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer\nproducts and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and\nreputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm\nour business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including\nwith respect to minors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition. In\naddition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example,\ndata protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and other jurisdictions\nhave initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect\nand use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March\n2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of\ncertain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In\nJuly 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved\nby the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to\npay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and\noversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of\ncertain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the\nIDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. We have in the past been, and may\nin the future be, subject to fines and requirements to changes to our business practices as a result of such\ninquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a lawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the\n“tag suggestions” and other facial recognition features on our products.\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business,\nincluding with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations, and\nlawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition,\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits\nby the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things.\nThe complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram\nand WhatsApp. In addition, in December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that\nwe tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example,\n39\nT able of Contents\nbeginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations\nand the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other\nregulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our\nbusiness practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\nrequirements around the world, such as the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and DSA. In particular, we are\nmaintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial\nmanagement and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations,\nprohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance\nwith the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party\nassessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance\nand oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are\nreallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an\nadverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to\nour business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a\ntimely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and\noversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The\nrequirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly\nto our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full\ncompliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any\nsuch issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly\nevolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we will be subject to\nnew restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services\nand product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. If we are\nunable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CPRA, ePrivacy\nDirective, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the\nconsent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or\nlawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we may also be\nrequired to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies, algorithms, and enforcement actions with\nrespect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to\ndefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property\nrights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of\ncontent, online safety, products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example,\nwe have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on\nallegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. The potential risks relating to any of\nthe foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions\n40\nT able of Contents\noutside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we\nmay be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European\nUnion passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright\ninfringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive\nto apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states have begun to implement. In the United States, the\nU.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online\nplatforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have\nbeen, and continue to be, various state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the\nscope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect\nto commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current\nprotections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We\ncould also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-\nimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has\nresulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to\ncomply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other\ncountries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar\nlegislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans,\nfor failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to\nfines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey,\nand we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also\nhas required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices,\nincrease our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies.\nFor example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for\ncopyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to\nmake substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright\nDirective may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services will be\nsubject to new restrictions and requirements, and our compliance costs may significantly increase, as a result of\nthe Digital Services Act in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, and\npotentially other content-related legislative developments such as proposed online safety bills in Ireland and the\nUnited Kingdom. Certain countries have also proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain\nnews content shared on our products. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230\nor the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase\nour costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely\naffect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual,\nand digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send\nmoney to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other\nprepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable\nfundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we\nmay also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase\nflexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally\nrequire us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with\nthese laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not\nguarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory\nrequirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be\nrequired to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the\n41\nT able of Contents\ninvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We\nhave also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional\npayments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing\nrisks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our\nsystems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase\nads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other\nobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving\nnew and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and\nattacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors,\nand we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address\nundesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may\ncause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose\nconfidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts\nto protect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform,\nmay also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor\nerror or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or\nofferings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or\nother threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to\ndisclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in\nsophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to\ndisable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot\nassure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or\nthat our remediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of certain\npersonnel working remotely could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against\nattacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\n42\nT able of Contents\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of\nthese efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce,\nadditional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all\nsuch incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of\nvisibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other\nprojects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy\nassessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents\nand activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner\ninconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election\ninterference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances\nof spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any\nof the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and\nbrands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business\nand financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries,\nwhich could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to\nenhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely, or\nhuman error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a\nnegative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in\na manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For\nexample, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within\nand across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us\nfrom fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our\nsystems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical\nlimitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our\ncommitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our\nreputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for\nfines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n43\nT able of Contents\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative\nnon-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective\ntechnology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have\nexperienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the\ndisputes and litigation referred to above.\n44\nT able of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2022. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely\naffect our business.\n45\nT able of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of\nour Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting\npower of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to\nour stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your\nability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n46\nT able of Contents\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n47\nT able of Contents",

          "content": "Legal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case,\nand the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple\nputative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer\nprotection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of\nconsumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement\nto resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead\n48\nT able of Contents\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the\nlawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of\nEuropean Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and\npreliminarily proposed that transfers of such user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a revised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC\nmaintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision was then\nfurther refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other European data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the\nGDPR's consistency mechanism. Separately, on October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on\nEnhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities, and on December 13, 2022, the European\nCommission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. On\nJanuary 19, 2023, the IDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board, pursuant to the\ndispute resolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus\ncould not be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may\nissue as early as the first quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and\ndata protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceeding) could subject us\nto substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal,\nby competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and\nby maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became\nthe subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December\n9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and\nWhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we\nviolated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and\nother equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the\ncourt granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's\ncomplaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the\nattorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended\ncomplaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been\nfiled in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss\nthe consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class\naction brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nfirst amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged\nviolation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in\n49\nT able of Contents\ntheir administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton\nAct, and seeking other relief as well. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending\nthem. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook\nMarketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. The result of\nsuch litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt\nor require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business,\nor subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in teenage users,\nresulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed\nin California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school districts recently filed public\nnuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial\njudge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously\ndefending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning\nthe use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed\ncertain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29,\n2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order,\nand the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending it.\nIn July 2017, an individual filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and other companies for allegedly violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by aiding, abetting, and providing\nmaterial support to an organization that committed an international terrorist act, and seeking unspecified damages.\nIn October 2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss. In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit reversed the judgment. On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the judgment in\nthis action, along with a companion case against another company in which the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review\nthe scope of protection available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section\n230). We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. However, changes to the\nprotections available under Section 230 may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products,\nbusiness practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag\nsuggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric\nIdentifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and\ninjunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending it.\n50\nT able of Contents\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes.",

          "content": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with\nour consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2022 using 2021 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. In 2022, we\ncontinued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with\nconsumers and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest in both our family of\napps and our metaverse efforts based on our company priorities.\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2022 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2022 was\n$116.61 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2021, which reflects a $5.96 billion negative impact from the\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. Revenue on a constant currency basis was\n$122.57 billion for 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 2021. Our advertising revenue was impacted by a reduction\nin advertising demand during 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer\nspending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting\nand measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. Our average price per ad\ndecreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022, partially offset by a n 18% year-over-year increase in ad impressions\ndelivered across our Family of Apps.\nIncome from operations for 2022 was $28.94 billion, a decrease of $17.81 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021, mainly\ndue to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with a 20% increase in employee headcount\nparticularly in engineering and other technical functions and higher operational expenses related to our data\ncenters and technical infrastructure. Starting in the third quarter of 2022, we began a series of cost management\ninitiatives including facilities consolidation, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, and a pivot in our data\ncenter strategy, which resulted in total restructuring charges of $4.61 billion in 2022. We expect we may incur\nsignificant additional restructuring charges as we continue to focus on cost efficiency measures through 2023.\n54\nT able of Contents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

Our reported headcount includes\na substantial majority of the approximately 11,000 employees impacted by the layoff we announced in November 2022,\nwho will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nRestructuring\nIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic\npriorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several\noffice buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL\nsegments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center\nprojects.\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows\n(in millions) :\nFacilities       Severance and Other\nConsolidation           Personnel Costs       Data Center Assets       Total\nCost of revenue         $                    154    $                    —    $               1,341    $  1,495\nResearch and                               1,311                       408                        —       1,719\ndevelopment\nMarketing and sales                          404                       234                        —         638\nGeneral and                                  426                       333                        —         759\nadministrative\nTotal                   $                  2,295    $                  975    $               1,341    $  4,611\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million.\nThese charges lowered our operating margin by four percentage points and diluted earnings per share (EPS) by $1.34.\nThe impact of severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 was not material after\noffsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses.\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding restructuring charges.\n55\nT able of Contents\nFamily of Apps Metrics\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.96 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.00 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.96 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 18% year-over-year in 2022 , and the average\nprice per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022 .\nDevelopments in Advertising\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on\ntargeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we\ndo not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and\nwe expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad\ntargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy\nDirective, and California Privacy Rights Act have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and\nwe expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a\nresult, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our products and user data practices,\nwhich reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser\nproviders, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the\nability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising.\nFor example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes\nto its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising,\nwhich has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our\nad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities\nwhile reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated\nthird-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems,\nas well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to\ninnovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing\ngrowing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are\nmaking significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting,\nand measurement capabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of\nnew open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We expect that some of\nthese efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described above will\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will\ncontinue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe\nadvertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market\nuncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have\nreduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we have\nintroduced new features such as Reels and are investing in our artificial intelligence-powered discovery engine to\nrecommend relevant unconnected content across our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it is not currently\nmonetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size\nof our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in\nUkraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the\nRussian government, which adversely affected user growth and engagement in 2022 . These trends adversely affected\nadvertising revenue in 2022 , and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n56\nT able of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business and results of operations, with a varied impact on user growth\nand engagement, as well as the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a\nreduction in advertising demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the\npandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, and we experienced\nincreasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has declined,\nand we saw continued softening of advertising demand in 2022 as many activities that shifted online during COVID-19\nrelated lockdowns resumed in person. We may experience similar volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\nadvertising services as a result of the pandemic in the future.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have\nperfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex\njudgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the\nglobe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to\nidentify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to\nquantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.\nInvestment Philosophy\nIn 2022 , we continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the\nmajor social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new\nexperiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the\nfuture; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow\nand create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in\nthe world.\nWe anticipate that investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount will\ncontinue to drive expense growth in 2023, which will adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. The\nmajority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022 , 82% of our total costs and\nexpenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to\nheadcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising\nservices. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and\naugmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies\nfor the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across\nthese efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for\nproducts for the metaverse that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade.\nAlthough it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL\nsegment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse\nefforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a\ncomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of\nthe internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\n57\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile\ndevices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    79%    79%    79%    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family\nmetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such\nupdate contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.\nWorldwide DAP increased 5% to 2.96 billion on average during December 2022 from 2.82 billion during December 2021.\n58\nT able of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP.

For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of\nour models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately\n70 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family\nmetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such\nupdate contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3.74 billion MAP, an increase of 4% from 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n59\nT able of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $8.62    $7.75    $8.36    $8.18    $9.39    $7.72    $7.91    $7.53    $8.63\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $31.79, a\ndecrease of 6% from 2021.\n60\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of\nour daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\nDAU/MAU:    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    67%    67%    67%    67%\n…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    D…    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…\n…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    D…    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n61\nT able of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 4% to 2.00 billion on aver age during December 2022 from 1.93 billion during December 2021\n. Users in India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during\nDecember 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 2.96 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2021. Users in India,\nNigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.\n62\nT able of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2022 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $10.14    $9.27    $10.12    $10.00    $11.57    $9.54    $9.82    $9.41    $10.86\n$  …    $  …    $  …    $  …    $  …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\n63\nT able of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $39.63, a\ndecrease of 3% from 2021. For 2022, ARPU decreased by 9% in Europe and 4% in United States & Canada, and increased\nby 4% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was mostly in geographies with relatively\nlower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily\nconcentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may decrease at a higher\nrate, or increase at a slower rate, relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or\npotentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.\n64\nT able of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets\nincluding goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives,\nwhen applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we\nconsider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our\nsignificant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes\nto consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating\nwhether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis.\nIn this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred\nto the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory\nrisk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent\nin a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Non-marketable Equity Securities\nFor our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the\nmeasurement alternative, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar\nto the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and\nobligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and\nconversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to,\nrights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the\nidentification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our\ninvestee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair\nvalue adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction\nactually occurred. For non-marketable equity securities, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date\nto determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such\nas, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;\nregulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events\nand factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in\nthe consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair\nvalue requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and\nmarket data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate\n65\nT able of Contents\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development\ntax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our\nactivities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for\nour uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with\nthe income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the\nrefinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is\nmade, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 13 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 16 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated\nUseful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to\nmake significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in\nvaluing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected\ncash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade\n66\nT able of Contents\nnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and\nliabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the\nuseful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the\nmeasurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We\nhave two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill\nhas been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of our servers and network assets category effective the second and the fourth\nquarters of 2022. The financial impact of the changes in estimates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860\nmillion and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing\nas of the effective date of the change and applying the revised useful lives prospectively.\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K, for additional information regarding the changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network\nassets.\n67\nT able of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad\nproducts either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number\nof impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels\nproducts are not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we\nincrease or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We\ncalculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing\nthe average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For\nadvertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and\nrevenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest , wearables, and\nrelated software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of\nour products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally,\ncost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-\ncancelable contractual commitments.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who\nare responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development\ncosts, and professional services.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also\ninclude professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human\nresources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which\ninclude estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.\n68\nT able of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2021.

The decrease was mostly driven by advertising\nrevenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2022 decreased $1.29 billion, or 1%, compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the average price\nper ad, partially offset by an increase in the number of ads delivered. In 2022, the average price per ad decreased\nby 16%, as compared with an increase of 24% in 2021. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase\nin the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products such as video and Reels that monetize at\nlower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, the decrease in average price per ad was\nimpacted by a reduction in advertising demand, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending\nas a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement\ntools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors\ndiscussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results.\" In 2022, the number of ads\ndelivered increased by 18%, as compared with a 10% increase in 2021. Ads impressions grew in all regions during\n2022, mostly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads\ndelivered during 2022 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and\nan increase in users. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and\nthe number of ads delivered.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2022 decreased $115 million, or 5%, compared to 2021. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a\ndecrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 16%, and\n31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 declined 17%, 7%, and 16% compared to the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019,\nrespectively.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2022 compared\nto the same period in 2021 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year\n2022 using the prior\n70\nT able of Contents\nyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total\nrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $122.57 billion and $119.54 billion, respectively.

The increase was mainly due to an\nincrease in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, adjusted for a decrease\nin the depreciation growth rate due to extensions in the useful lives of servers and network assets. In addition,\nwe recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges related to data center assets. These increases were partially\noffset by a decrease in RL inventory cost including lower losses on purchase commitments.\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and\nnetwork assets as well as the abandonment charges related to data center assets, respectively.\nResearch and development\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                       2022 vs 2021 %       2021 vs 2020 %\n2022            2021            2020               change               change\n-in millions,\nexcept\npercentages\nResearch and     $          35,338       $  24,655       $  18,447                   43  %                34  %\ndevelopment\nPercentage of                   30  %           21  %           21  %\nrevenue\nResearch and development expenses in 2022 increased $10.68 billion, or 43%, compared to 2021.

Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual\nproperty from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the\neffects of changes in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 27,\n2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2023 to be\nin the low twenties. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and\ndevelopment expenses incurred in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory\ncapitalization requirement increased our 2022 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax\nrate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement\nis deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax\nliabilities could be several billion dollars lower.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nOn August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The key tax provisions applicable to us\nare a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023.\nWe do\n73\nT able of Contents\nnot expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position; however, we will\ncontinue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits . As of December 31, 2022, we had net uncertain tax positions of $5.49 billion which were\naccrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related\nto transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing\nservices and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax\ncredits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or\nevents that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described\nbelow and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such\namounts within the next 12 months.\nSee Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n74\nT able of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated\nfrom operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks,\ninvestments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $40.74 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.26 billion from December 31, 2021. The majority of the decrease was due to\n$32.04 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $27.96 billion repurchases\nof our Class A common stock, $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted\nstock unit (RSU) awards, and $1.31 billion for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These decreases\nwere partially offset by $50.48 billion of cash generated from operations and $9.92 billion of net proceeds from\nthe issuance of fixed-rate senior notes (the \"Notes\") in August 2022.\nCash paid for income taxes was $6.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our\nfederal net operating loss carryforward was $196 million and our federal tax credit carryforward was $276 million.\nWe anticipate the utilization of most of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87\nbillion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of\nrepurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   50,475    $   57,683    $   38,747\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                  -28,970    $   -7,570    $  -30,059\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -22,136    $  -50,728    $  -10,292\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2022 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash\nitems, such as $11.99 billion of share-based compensation expense, $8.69 billion of depreciation and amortization,\nand $3.56 billion of impairment for leases, leasehold improvements, and abandonment charges for data center assets\nrelated to our restructuring efforts. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2022 compared to\n2021 was mainly du e to a decrease in net income as adjusted for the aforementioned non-cash items, partially\noffset by changes in working capital.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $31.19 billion of net purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.53\nbillion proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in\ninvesting activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to an increase in net purchases of property and\nequipment, and a decrease in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $27.96 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $9.92\nbillion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2022\ncompared to 2021 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock and proceeds from the\nissuance of the Notes.\n75\nT able of Contents\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022          2021          2020\nNet cash provided by operating              $                   50,475    $   57,683    $   38,747\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment, net                       -31,186       -18,567       -15,115\nPrincipal payments on finance leases                              -850          -677          -604\nFree Cash Flow                              $                   18,439    $   38,439    $   23,028\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be\nsufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months\nand thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including\nour access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our\nfinance lease obligations mostly include certain network infrastructure. Our restructuring efforts to sublease,\nearly terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases did not materially change our operating\nlease obligations.\nOur contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and\nconsumer hardware products in Reality Labs.\n76\nT able of Contents\nLong-term Debt\nIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued in\nfour series, which mature from 2027 through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as\nof December 31, 2022 are $411 million and $7.69 billion, respectively. We intend to use the net proceeds from the\noffering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures,\nrepurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable\nincurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $361 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we\nwill pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include\n$5.49 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Due to uncertainties in the timing of\nthe completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 9 — Leases, Note 11 — Long-term Debt, Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Income Taxes\nin the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Legal Proceedings\"\ncontained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding leases and\ncontractual commitments, long-term debt, taxes, and contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n77\nT able of Contents",

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $81 million, $140 million, and $129 million were recognized in\n2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash\nequivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents,\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\nmarket interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $558 million and $714 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any\nrealized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized losses would\nonly occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also had $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes (the\n\"Notes\") outstanding. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations\nin interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the\nNotes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and\ndeclining in periods of increasing interest rates.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments are substantially all in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price\nrisks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for most of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative,\nwhich is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for\nidentical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to\ndetermine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as,\nbut not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;\neconomic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of\nour non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable\ntransactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the\nvaluation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in\nour investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $6.20 billion and $6.78 billion\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n78\nT able of Contents\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity\nSecurities, Note 7 — Fair Value Measurements, and Note 11 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item\n7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n79\nT able of Contents",

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n81\nT able of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n82\nT able of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2023\n83\nT able of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the\nCompany) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2023 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2023\n84\nT able of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring\nthe world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the\nmetaverse to life.\nW e report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) . The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, including the ultimate resolution\nof litigation, regulatory matters, and asserted and unasserted claims, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses\nof available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, and fair\nvalue of leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of\nregulations, and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially\nfrom those estimates.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of a majority of the servers and network assets from four yearsto 4.5years,\neffective the second quarter of 2022, and further extended the useful lives to five yearseffective the fourth\nquarter of 2022. The changes in estimated useful lives were due to expected longer refresh cycles in our data\ncenters. The financial impact of the changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $ 860million and an\nincrease in net income of $ 693million, or $ 0.26per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact\nfrom the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the\neffective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n91\nT able of Contents\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\nmobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related\nsoftware and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which\nis generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in\nexchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from\nWhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue\nincludes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable\ncontractual commitments.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available\n92\nT able of Contents\nfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for\ncapitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n93\nT able of Contents\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.65billion, $ 2.99billion, and $ 2.26billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting mostly of U.S. government securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as\navailable-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for\ncurrent operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses,\nnet of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt\nsecurities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of\nthat difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities\nare recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income,\nand any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in\nstockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nwere not material. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific\nidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, and\nretention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and\nother assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The\nchange in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated\nstatements of income. We periodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators\nexist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write down the investment to\nfair value.During the year ended December 31, 2022, losses resulted from such remeasurements were $ 447million.\nGains and losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. For additional\ninformation, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n94\nT able of Contents\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models\nutilizing observable market inputs. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair\nvalue and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets\nin active markets to estimate their fair value. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors\nused to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions\noccur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowances for accounts receivable\nwere immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at\ncost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets\nare described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           FourtoFive years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , we recorded\n$ 1.34billion of abandonment charges for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) Topic 360 related to our restructuring efforts . For additional information regarding\nour restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n95\nT able of Contents\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining\ncarrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated\nuseful life. See section \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional information regarding changes in the estimated\nuseful lives of our servers and network assets.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in\nprogress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\nservice for their intended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, colocations, land, network infrastructure, and\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is\na lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease\ncomponents and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such\nas contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such\nvariable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and\nequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment losses of $ 2.22billion in aggregate for operating\nlease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation\nrestructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models\n(income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating\nfair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income\nover the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving\nfuture cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\n96\nT able of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration\nto identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not\namortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related\nexpenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill\nimpairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\n97\nT able of Contents\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax of $ 1.86billion and $ 677million,\nrespectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 81million, $\n140million, and $ 129million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly\nof money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities\nconsist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\ncorporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified\namong individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 was not\nmaterial.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 40%, 41%, and 42% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of\nrevenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Canada,\nAustralia and Japan.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2022, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic\n805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which\nclarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a\nbusiness combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn July 1, 2022, we early adopted ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03), which clarifies and amends the guidance\nof measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the\nequity securities. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn October 1, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities\nabout Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received\n98\nT able of Contents\nby most business entities by requiring annual disclosures of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2)\nthe accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial\nstatements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions).

As a result, we recorded impairment charges for the\nrelated operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leasehold improvements.\nIn November 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000of our employees across the FoA and RL segments. As\na result, we recorded severance and other personnel related expenses for the impacted employees.\nIn December 2022, we reevaluated our data center investment strategy to improve efficiency and further advance our\nefforts around artificial intelligence. As a result, we decided to pivot several of our data center building\nprojects to a next generation design while also canceling multiple existing data center projects. This strategy led\nto abandonment charges of the related data center assets.\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows\n(in millions) :\nFacilities       Severance and Other\nConsolidation(1)           Personnel Costs       Data Center Assets       Total\nCost of revenue              $               154    $                    —    $               1,341    $  1,495\nResearch and development                   1,311                       408                        —       1,719\nMarketing and sales                          404                       234                        —         638\nGeneral and                                  426                       333                        —         759\nadministrative\nTotal                        $             2,295    $                  975    $               1,341    $  4,611\n________________________\n(1) Facilities consolidation includes impairment charges and accelerated expenses related to certain operating\nlease ROU assets and leasehold improvements.\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $ 4.10billion and RL segment were $ 515million.\nThe following table is a summary of the changes in the severance and other personnel liabilities, included within\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, related to the workforce\nreduction (in millions):\nBalance as of January 1, 2022                —\nSeverance and other personnel costs        975\nCash payments during the period           -203\nBalance as of December 31, 2022(1)     $   772\n__________________________\n(1) We expect the remaining severance and termination related liabilities to be substantially paid out in cash\nduring the first half of 2023.\n100\nT able of Contents\nNote 4.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of\ndilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 95million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as including them would have an anti-\ndilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2022                     2021                     2020\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,285         402        2,383         432        2,407         444\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                    8.63    $   8.63    $   13.99    $  13.99    $   10.22    $  10.22\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  19,729    $  3,471    $  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            3,471           —        6,042           —        4,539           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -19            —         -93            —         -58\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  23,200    $  3,452    $  39,370    $  5,949    $  29,146    $  4,481\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,285         402        2,383         432        2,407         444\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           402           —          432           —          444           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             15           —           44           —           37           —\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,702         402        2,859         432        2,888         444\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                    8.59    $   8.59    $   13.77    $  13.77    $   10.09    $  10.09\n101\nT able of Contents\nNote 5.

The effective interest rates include the interest rates stated on the Notes and amortization of\nthe discounts and issuance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense recognized on the debt was\n$ 160million.\nThe total estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $ 8.63billion as of December 31, 2022.

As a result, the parental guarantee by Meta Platforms, Inc. was\nno longer required.\nContractual Commitments\nWe have $ 19.91billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022, which are primarily\nrelated to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs. The\nfollowing is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n2023          $  13,203\n2024              2,295\n2025              1,434\n2026                265\n2027                209\nThereafter        2,504\nTotal         $  19,910\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components\nthat do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. We enter into these agreements in order to secure either\nvolume or price. Using the projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend as of\nDecember 31, 2022\n110\nT able of Contents\nis approximately $ 10.34billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years. The ultimate spend under these\nagreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nIn January 2023, we entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy in the amount of approximately\n$ 1.6billion.\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case,\nand the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple\nputative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer\nprotection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of\nconsumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement\nto resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725million by us and is subject to court approval. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of\nour directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, we are currently subject to an IDPC inquiry regarding Meta Platforms Ireland's\nability to transfer European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data to the United States, which is\ndescribed further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to\nreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts\nfor loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material in the\naggregate.\n111\nT able of Contents\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal\nand California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in teenage users,\nresulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed\nin California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and threeschool districts recently filed public\nnuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial\njudge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously\ndefending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning\nthe use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received\nadditional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class\nactions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary\nduties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified\ndamages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our\nestimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher\nprices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek\nunspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed\ncertain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29,\n2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order,\nand the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending it.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and\ngovernment inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our\nbusiness practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile\nor online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it\nhad opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair\nmethods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp\n112\nT able of Contents\nin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of\n2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys\ngeneral. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of\nColumbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram\nin 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged\nthat we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and\nattorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28,\n2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing\nthe FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28,\n2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an\namended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11,\n2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also\nbeen filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging\nviolations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of\ncertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss\nthe consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class\naction brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nfirst amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\nIn addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged\nviolation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in their administrative court seeking to\npermanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relief as\nwell. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the\nEuropean Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use\ndata in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag\nsuggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric\nIdentifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and\ninjunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending it.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 16 — Income Taxes.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties.\n113\nT able of Contents\nThese agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees,\nand our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2022, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2022.\nNote 14.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2022, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are collectively referred\nto as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 2,247million shares of Class A common stock and 367million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $ 38.79billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161million shares\nof our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 27.93billion. As of December 31, 2022, $ 10.87billion\nremained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $ 40billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plan\nWe have oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which\nwas amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance\nof incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in\nconnection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 66million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under\nour Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of\nshares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of\nthe Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal\nto the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding\n114\nT able of Contents\nDecember 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase\nprovision, our board of directors approved an increase of 56million shares of Class A common stock reserved for\nissuance, effective January 1, 2023.\nIn December 2022, our board of directors approved an amendment to our Amended 2012 Plan to increase the number of\nshares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan by 425million shares, effective March 1, 2023 (Plan\nAmendment).

We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 276million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 3.72billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization.

During all years presented, we recognized interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated\nstatements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $\n1.07billion and $ 960million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 10.76billion as of December 31, 2022 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 6.49billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in\nAugust 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional\ntax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n118\nT able of Contents\nNote 17.

Our operating segments are\nthe same as our reportable segments.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM) , who allocates resources to and assesses\nthe performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss)\nfrom operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer\nhardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a\nreasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating\nsegments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure.

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\nand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nour management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs.",
