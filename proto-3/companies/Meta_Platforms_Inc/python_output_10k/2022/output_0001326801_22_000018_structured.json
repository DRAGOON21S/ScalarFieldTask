          "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our\nproducts, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nWe build technology that helps people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers,\nvirtual reality (VR) headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and learn about what is\ngoing on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other\nactivities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay\nconnected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like\naugmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social\ntechnology.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). For FoA, we generate\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Ads on our platforms enable\nmarketers to reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors.\nMarketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-\nparty applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and\ncontent. Our products include:\nFamily of Apps\nFacebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through News Feed, Stories, Groups,\nWatch, Marketplace, Reels, Dating, and more.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can express themselves and push culture\nforward through photos, video, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite businesses.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, audio and video calls, and Rooms.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nReality Labs\nReality Labs. Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nMeta Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge VR hardware, software, and content. Facebook Portal video\ncalling devices help friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in meaningful ways.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover\ncontent and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for\nexample, Alphabet (Google and YouTube),\n7\nTable of Contents\nAmazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to\nattract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid\nbusiness and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\nhardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our\nexisting products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts\nto develop the metaverse, we may become subject to additional competition.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases,\nand as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to\nexpand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to\ndevelop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security,\nprivacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against\nabuse.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate in more than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also\ninvest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising,\nmarketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data\ndisclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or\nother trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance,\nand online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy\nand protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and\nother laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more\nrestrictive than those in the United States.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely\naffect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove\nor restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications\nDecency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business\npractices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the\nIrish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs\nin respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and\npreliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022.\nIf a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely\nupon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer\na number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business. For example, the GDPR includes operational\nrequirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are\ndifferent from those previously in place in the European Union, requires submission of personal data breach\nnotifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-\ncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a\nrelatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead\nto significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement\nof the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection\nregulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, and its\nsuccessor, the California Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect in January 2023, also establish certain\ntransparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European\nUnion's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of\nthese or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of\nlegislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as\nother jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example,\nthe proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially\nimpose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data\nacross services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are\nconsidering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and\nprocessing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nNew legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may\nalso result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in\ncertain jurisdictions.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil\nrights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also\ncurrently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified\nconsent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and,\namong other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or\nenforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs,\nexpose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies),\ninterrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in\nnegative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our\nbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Meta, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe\nthat people are at the heart of every connection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas,\ninnovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design, marketing,\nand other areas to further our mission.\nWe had a global workforce of 71,970 employees as of December 31, 2021, which represents a 23% year-over-year\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as\nwe continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a\nnumber of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review\ninitiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth.\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe.\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the\nlong term, we expect some personnel to continue to transition to working remotely on a regular basis. We offer most\nof our full-time employees the option to work remotely on a regular basis.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are core to our work at Meta. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace\nwhere we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for\nthe global community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\nAs part of our diversity and inclusion report, we publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity\nworkforce data annually. As of June 30, 2021, our global employee base was comprised of 36.7% females and 63.3%\nmales, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 45.7% Asian, 39.1% White, 6.5%\nHispanic, 4.4% Black, 3.9% two or more ethnicities, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska\nNative and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In recent years, we also announced our goals to have 50% of\nour workforce made up of underrepresented groups by 2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in\nleadership positions in the United States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also\ncontinue our ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women in leadership.\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and\nhiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We\nhave seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this\napproach in 2015. We also continue to develop inclusive internship programs, and Meta University, our training\nprogram for college freshmen and sophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and\ninclusive approach to promote participation by people from underrepresented groups. To help build community among\nour people and support their professional development, we invest in our internal Meta Resource Groups and our\nannual Community events such as Women's\n10\nTable of Contents\nCommunity Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer\nManaging Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, Be the Ally, and other trainings to promote an inclusive workplace\nby helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of\nbias in the workplace.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2021, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United\nStates for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones with resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement\nsavings plans, access to tax and legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, family leave, and\npaid time off.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nour ability to compete effectively;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nvolatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding,\nretaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and\nInstagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size\nof our active user base increases. In addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,\nfluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time,\nparticularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have\nreduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business and\nmacroeconomic conditions. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases\nin the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside. We are unable to predict the impact of the\npandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and these trends may continue to be subject to\nvolatility. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the\ntotal number of DAUs on Facebook, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs\non Facebook in the United States & Canada region. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may\nadversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or\nretain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other\nsocial networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of\nengagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar\nerosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user\nengagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services. Any\nnumber of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency,\n13\nTable of Contents\nprominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with our products;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram,\nin Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or\nlegislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we\nrely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\nwe take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the\ngeneral public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board\nregarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\nexperience in the long term);\nwe make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a\nresult of actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;\n14\nTable of Contents\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries;\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making\nit easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. As our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability\nto maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\nAs is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our\nmarketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not\ncontinue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not\ndeliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will\ngenerate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We\nhave implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes\nreduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to\nadversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on\ninvestment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial\nresults may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n15\nTable of Contents\nadverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising,\nincluding developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nsuch as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or\nmessaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook\nand Instagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our\nreliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\nmobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or\npotential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a\nnumber of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on\nour products);\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads,\nincluding as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations,\nregulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\nthe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have\naffected, and may in the future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we experienced in\n2020 with the regional and worldwide economic\n16\nTable of Contents\ndisruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The\neffects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads, a related decline in pricing of our ads,\nand additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services, and any\nsimilar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads\nshown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user\nactivity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party\nmobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact,\nthe availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools\nthat incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our\nbusiness. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe\nfollowing adoption of the GDPR, which will increase further with expanded control over certain third-party data as\npart of our ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for\ncertain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation in\nthese or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further\nreduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple\nand Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and\napplication developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021,\nApple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating\nsystem that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit\nto us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product\nchanges that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on\nour products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product\nchanges we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability to target and\nmeasure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our\nadvertising revenue in the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and\nmeasurement challenges associated with iOS changes. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take\nfurther effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected,\nwhich would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our\nproducts rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular\nmobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the\nAndroid and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or\nchanges in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or\nmobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or\neliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products,\nlimit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the\ndistribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products and\nmonetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits\nthe use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts\nmonetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We\nexpect that any similar changes to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our\nability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver\nhigh quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies,\nproducts, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with\nthese technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is\n17\nTable of Contents\nmore difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to\naccess or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products,\nour user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the\ndistribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best\ninterests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating\nsystems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and\nthere is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our\nusers are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user\ngrowth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have in the\npast experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and\nstandards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth,\nengagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new\nproducts, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also\ninvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to\nsupport increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and\nwe may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long\nterm. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage\nusers, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users\nor to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business\nmay be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking\nalgorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial\nresults. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our\nproduct and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to\nour products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and\ncould reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or\nother changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties,\nformats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as\nwe focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have\nreduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products\nor services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue\nto promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. These\ndecisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits\nthat we expect.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product\nstrategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-\nterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in\nprivacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other\nparticipants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of\nfeatures, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. In addition, we have limited experience\nwith consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other companies to\ncompete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including\nif we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate\neffectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also\ndivert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make\nsignificant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our\nability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In\naddition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations\nin the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy and e-commerce, which may\ndelay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant\nmanagement time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse\nstrategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect\nour business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may\nnegatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if\nusers do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products\nor interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media,\nlegislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption,\ncontent, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in\nconnection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future\nadversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of\nmedia, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal\ncompany documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content\nenforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-\nbeing. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer\nthat shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond\nexpeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices\nby advertisers or developers, or to otherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in\nthe past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions\nof users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false\nor inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be\nmisleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to\nuser information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our\nproducts or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the\npandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content\non our platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or\nactual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend\nparticipation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.\nCertain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our\nhandling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues,\nhave eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we\n19\nTable of Contents\nfail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business\nand financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web\napplications that integrate with Facebook and our other products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and\nweb applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may\nnot be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user\nengagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled\nby third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are\ncontinuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal\nuser experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such\ndevelopers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these\ndevelopers to users on Facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and\nsuch actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile\nand web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety,\nand security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these\nactions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or\nwill adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or\ngrow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or\nif we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our\nadvertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to\ncontain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business\nactivity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause,\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions, which have previously significantly\nimpacted our business and results of operations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising\nrevenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public\noffering. While our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent quarters, there can be no assurance that\nit will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic\npreviously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, which in turn increased demand for our\nadvertising services. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, and we may experience\nreduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues,\nwhich could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our advertising services\nmay be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict\nthe duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business,\nthe pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\n20\nTable of Contents\nadverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of\nlimitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as\nthe necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to\nperform;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nnegative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us. The persistence of COVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread\nof the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate our business and may materially\nand adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop\ntools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share,\ncommunicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective\naudiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google and YouTube), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft,\nSnap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to\nattract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products\nand services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies\nintroduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become subject\nto additional competition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of\nour competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more\neffectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users,\nparticularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a\nsubstitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement\nwith our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly\nengage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics\nor more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit\nour ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and\n21\nTable of Contents\nmeasure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or\ngenerate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business\nand financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but\nwe cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate\nwith Facebook and our other products;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other\nproducts;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad\nimpressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\n22\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity,\ngovernment surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are\nintegrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance\nor enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or\nservices on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to\nthese topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of\nallegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may\nin the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit\nor objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections\nin the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size,\nengagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in\ndecreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse\neffects to varying degrees from time to time.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\nimpressions;\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result\nof the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\n23\nTable of Contents\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of\ntime;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, and\ncontent, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\n24\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity\ninvestments, and in interest rates;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nOur rates of growth may be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect they will\ndecline over time in the future.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, volatility in our user and revenue growth rates\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility\nwith any certainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the\nsize of our active user base increases, and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or\nmore markets, particularly as we achieve greater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will\ncontinue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience volatility\nor decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock could decline.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding\noperations, including our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time\nto time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and\nregulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in\nnew platforms and technologies, including as we continue our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of\nthese investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only\nlimited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of\nsuch investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our\n2021 overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and we expect our investments to increase in future\nperiods. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2021, the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority issued an order directing us to divest our Giphy acquisition, which we have appealed. In some\ncases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance\nthat we will realize expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities for our\nacquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result\nin increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other\nrestrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our\nexpenses, adversely affect our financial results, and\n25\nTable of Contents\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce\ncould be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business\nor the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies\nthat have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not\nmanage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our\nacquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing\noperating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a\npotential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\nperformance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a\ncombination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the\namount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism,\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate\nchange could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.\nAny such events may result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to\nrecover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may\nadversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy or\nother costs to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.\nIn 2020, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our\ntechnical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate any such demands in the future, including as a result\nof our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices\n26\nTable of Contents\nwe receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue\nto experience, supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical\ninfrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, and in the future we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs,\nor we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,\nincluding due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of\ncomponents, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges\nor actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to increased\nproject costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or\nreliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related\nto this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the\nuser experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United\nStates, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to such government action, could\nresult in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade\nthe quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP))\nand Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data\nbased on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition,\nwe are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to\nimprovements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can\nresult in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted\nby data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We\ngenerally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that\nare within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger,\n27\nTable of Contents\nand WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products\nin our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual\npeople. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that\nseek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an\nindividual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are\nsubject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and\nuncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which\nitself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to\nperiod, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is\nvery difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is\npossible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may\nindicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report\nthese metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including\nthrough the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user\nsurveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our\nproducts or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to\nidentify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts\n28\nTable of Contents\nare based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and\nsimilar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that\nappears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a\nresult of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative\nrequirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also\nmay impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may\nchange as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or\nproduct changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our\nability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure\nat our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from\nour estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain\nuser accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our\nestimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology\nor methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and\nestimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer,\nregulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers,\nor investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in\nour metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and\ndevelopers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions,\nwhich could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number\nof employees increasing to 71,970 as of December 31, 2021 from 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, and we expect\nheadcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives\nas well as other functions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products\ncreate significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple\nrelationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of our\nthird-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and\nprocedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of our management do not have\nsignificant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not\n29\nTable of Contents\nbe able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working\nremotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may\nnegatively impact productivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and\ncollaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience\ndifficulties integrating recently hired personnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we\nmust continue to adapt to a remote work environment; improve our operational, financial, and management processes\nand systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we\nare required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult\nto maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and\ninnovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international\nmarkets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available\nin China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy,\nmanage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject\nto a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and\nsafety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n30\nTable of Contents\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and\nsanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and\nauthorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for\nviolations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and\nother laws, rules, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our\noperations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks\ndescribed above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in\nlogistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product\ndevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse\nchanges in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and\nsale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nchallenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs,\nor supply chain disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment,\nand business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws,\nfails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as\nunethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines,\ncanceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand\nand consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and\nother factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components\nare ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in\naccurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or\nmanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they\nmay not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely\n31\nTable of Contents\naffect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the\npast, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising,\nantitrust, privacy, biometrics, content, algorithms, employment, activities on our platform, consumer protection,\nor product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual\nreality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple\nputative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data\nby a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of\nour earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other\nalleged anticompetitive conduct; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents\nbeginning in September 2021. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and\nany negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or\nundesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement\nmay differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in\nthe period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\n32\nTable of Contents\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase\nour tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such\nactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended\nchanges to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many\ncountries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework\nunder which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than\n140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.\nAs this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and\nultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and\nseveral countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under\nwhich we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For\nexample, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include\nbusiness activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2021, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision\nfor income taxes by $1.13 billion and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based\ncompensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of\nshare-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do\nnot control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely\naffect our financial results.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment\nat the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill\n33\nTable of Contents\nor intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies\nand systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our\noperations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to\nmaintain our competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical\npersonnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such\npersonnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other\nfactors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to\nattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based\ncompensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition,\nrestrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect\nour efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel . If we do not succeed in\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change\nof control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders\nsupport, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our\nother stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from\nacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might\nharm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the\nmanagement and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to\ncontrol the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated.\nAs a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith\nin a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a\ncontrolling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control\nas governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or\nmoderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other\nrestrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or\nindefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently\nrestricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other\ncountries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or\na threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in\nother countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that\nprovides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user\nservices, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In\naddition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong\nKong as a result of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising,\nincluding in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we\ngenerate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is\npossible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising\nrevenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or\ninformation requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as\nimposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found\nto be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish\ngovernment could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely\nimpact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to\ncensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors\nare able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets\nthat we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user\nengagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or\ngrow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of\nthese laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\nto our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user\ngrowth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights\nof publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention\nand deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and\nother communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications,\nproduct liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and\npolitical law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products,\nexpansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to\nadditional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content,\ncompetition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more\nrestrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in\nwhich we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data,\nsuch as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs will be the subject of future regulatory\nconsideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not\nachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European\nUnion to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of\nthis IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. In May 2021, the court\nrejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a\nfinal decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer\nframework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data\ntransfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant\nproducts and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have been managing investigations and\nlawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service\nand privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and services, including a lawsuit\ncurrently pending before the Supreme Court of India, and also became subject to government inquiries and lawsuits\nregarding the 2021 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy. If we are unable to transfer data\nbetween and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our\nproducts and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented\na number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant\npenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The\nGDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by\nthe IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism,\nwhich may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation\nand enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to\nsignificant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data\nprotection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in\ntheir respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, and\nits successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will take effect in January 2023, also establish\ncertain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control how their data is shared with third\nparties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will\ncontinue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, regulators continue to issue guidance\nconcerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. In\naddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly,\nthere are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our\nbusiness. For example, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs\nand could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as\nthe combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries,\nsuch as India, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring\nlocal storage and processing of data or similar\n36\nTable of Contents\nrequirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory\ndecisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on\nour advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be\nthe subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the\nUnited States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and\nexpand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or\nconsent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European\nUnion and other jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict\nthe ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In\naddition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data\npractices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to\nresolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other\nmatters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our\npractices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain\ngovernment inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to\nIDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in\nFacebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook.\nWe also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data\nbreaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European\nregulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our\nbusiness, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition,\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits\nby the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things.\nThe complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram\nand WhatsApp. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business\nactivities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government\ninvestigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former\nemployee.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties\n(including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner\nmaterially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of\n37\nTable of Contents\nthese adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business\npractices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the\nworld, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy\nprogram in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors\noversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making\nmisrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to\nthe FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and\nwill continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are\nincreasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including\ninvestments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources\ninternally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our\nother business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices\nand make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a\nresult, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has\nbeen and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts\nwill require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC\nconsent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and\nfrom time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these\nrequirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in\nthe future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject\nto significant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the\nmandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements,\nor if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to\nregulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments,\nor other penalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these\nevents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such\ninformation or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation,\ndissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of\npublicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety,\nconsumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside\nthe United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be\nless protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union\npassed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright\ninfringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive\nto apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United\nStates, there have been, and continue to be, various legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the\nscope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well\nas to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods\nand copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United\nStates could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nwe are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in\nparticular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For\nexample, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition\nof fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and\ndisclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are\nconsidering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines,\n38\nTable of Contents\nservice throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain\nprocesses. For example, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in\nconnection with social media legislation in Russia and Turkey. Content-related legislation also has required us in\nthe past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or\notherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or\nto implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial\ninvestments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may also\nrequire online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our compliance costs may significantly increase as a\nresult of the Digital Services Act proposed in the European Union, which is expected to take effect in 2023, and\nother content-related legislative developments such as online safety bills in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In\nthe United States, changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act or new state or federal content-related\nlegislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or\noperations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely\naffect our business and financial results.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital\ngoods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and\nmake donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and\nregulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and\ncounter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments,\nelectronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and\nimport and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws\nand regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or\ninterpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may\nevolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain payments licenses in the United States, the\nEuropean Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with\nmany domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be\ncostly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event\nthat we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary\nfines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans\nto develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and\nadditional licensing requirements.\nOur digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe are pursuing digital payments initiatives, such as Novi, a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a\nstandalone application and subsequently integrated in other Meta products. These initiatives may use blockchain-\nbased assets, such as the USDP stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is being used in a Novi pilot\nprogram in the United States and Guatemala beginning in October 2021. Our future initiatives to support commerce in\nthe metaverse also may use blockchain-based assets in digital payments. Use of blockchain-based assets in payments\nare a relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and\nevolving. These digital payments efforts have drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in\nmultiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. We are participating in responses to inquiries from\ngovernments and regulators related to our digital payments initiatives, and adverse government or regulatory\nactions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our\nbusiness.\nAs our digital payments initiatives evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates and international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, virtual currency,\nanti-money\n39\nTable of Contents\nlaundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, data protection, tax, consumer protection, and\ncompetition. In many jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear,\nparticularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. In\naddition, Novi has also received state money transmitter licenses in the United States, with more pending approval,\nand has other financial services license applications pending in certain other countries that would allow us to\nconduct digital wallet activities in those countries. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any\nassociated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the development of digital payments products and\nservices we offer, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nIn addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As\nsuch, there can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer will be made available in a\ntimely manner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may\nadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services. We\nwill also incur increased costs in connection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general\nhacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our\nsystems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase\nads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other\nobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving\nnew and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and\nattacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors.\nOur efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such\nbreaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users\nor marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm\nto us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities\non our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee,\ncontractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information\ntechnology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or\ntechnical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently\ninduce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-\nattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to\nprevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect\nsecurity breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to\nreact in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to\nprotect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nour products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\n40\nTable of Contents\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur\nsignificant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business\npractices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of\nthese efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce,\nadditional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all\nsuch incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of\nvisibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel\nworking remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and\nwe may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and\nmay in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts\nor policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising\npractices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data\nharvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce\nour policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include\nnegative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices\nin a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such\ndevelopments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to\nmonetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely, or\nhuman error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a\nnegative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in\na manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For\nexample, we make\n41\nTable of Contents\ncommitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products, and our systems are\nsubject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably.\nIn addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we\nrely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations\nor interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may\nin the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of\nrevenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or\n42\nTable of Contents\npractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could\nrequire significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise\nnegatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such\ndisputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2021. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may\nin the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable\nsegments;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation\n43\nTable of Contents\nin connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared\nsuch data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the\nsecond quarter of 2018; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in\nSeptember 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities\nlitigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our\nbusiness, and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders\nwho hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and\ntheir affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B\ncommon stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are\nable to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common\nstock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated\ncontrol will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including\nthe following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our\n44\nTable of Contents\ncompany requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established,\nand shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n45\nTable of Contents",

Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion\nand to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys\ngeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as\nour settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a\nrelated Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of\nour current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices.\nOn November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\npreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of\nEuropean user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user\ndata from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged\nprocedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020.\nOn May 14, 2021, the court rejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges, and the inquiry subsequently\nrecommenced. We believe a final decision in this\n46\nTable of Contents\ninquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy,\ndata use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\"\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and\ncosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our\nbusiness, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal,\nby competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries,\nand lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media\nservices, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in\nJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9,\n2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and\nby maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became\nthe subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December\n9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a\ncomplaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and\nWhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we\nviolated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and\nother equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the\ncourt granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's\ncomplaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the\nattorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an\namended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11,\n2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also\nbeen filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and\nother causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking\ndamages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users\nwere consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the\ncourt granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or\ninquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other\nstructural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being . Beginning on October 27, 2021,\nmultiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes.",

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and\nfree cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the\nsection entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency\nbasis, we translated revenue for the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the\nsection entitled \" — Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different\nfrom non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nMoreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes,\nand investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect\non our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental\ninformation about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods\nwhere certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect\nto key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2021 Results\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows:\nFamily of Apps metrics:\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.82 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.93 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 5% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.91 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nAd impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year in 2021, and the average price\nper ad increased by 24% year-over-year in 2021.\n50\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated and segment results:\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family\nof Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

All of our\nproducts, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to\nconnect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to\ninvest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing\nthe internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully\nimprove people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our\nbusiness by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv)\ncommunicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.\nOur advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a\nresult of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system.\nWe expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these and other\nlimitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-\nparty mobile operating systems and browsers.\nOur business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative\nmeasures implemented by authorities from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness, which have caused,\nand are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. Beginning\nin the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user\nbase across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-\nrelated trends subside, particularly in certain developed markets. We are unable to predict the impact of the\npandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to\nvolatility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period.\nWhile we experienced a reduction in demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we\nbelieve the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, particularly\nduring the second half of 2020, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend.\nMore recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our\nadvertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021. We may experience reduced advertising demand and related\ndeclines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. However, the impact of the\n51\nTable of Contents\npandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our\noverall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nUser growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021. For example,\ncompetitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, and in\nresponse to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels, which is growing in usage but is\nnot currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also saw a deceleration in our\ncommunity growth rates as the size of our community continued to increase. In addition, we experienced year-over-\nyear declines in ad impressions delivered in the United States & Canada region. These trends adversely affected\nadvertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue\ngrowth in the foreseeable future. Other global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had,\nand we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth.\nWe anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office\nfacilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, including in our Reality Labs initiatives, will\ncontinue to drive expense growth in 2022. We expect 2022 capit al expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion\nand total expenses to be in the range of $90-95 billion. In 2022, we also expect that our year-over-year total\nexpense growth rates may significantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect\nour operating margin and profitability.\n52\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our\nexpenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below)\naccess our Family products on mobile devices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%    79%    78%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020. In the first\nquarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent\nuser survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our\nreported worldwide DAP in March 2021.\nWorldwide DAP increased 8% to 2.82 billion on average during December 2021 from 2.60 billion during December 2020.\n53\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020. In the first\nquarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent\nuser survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million MAP to our\nreported worldwide MAP in March 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 3.59 billion MAP, an increase of 9% from 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $7.38    $6.03    $6.10    $6.76    $8.62    $7.75    $8.36    $8.18    $9.39\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $33.68, an\nincrease of 22% from 2020.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and\ncapital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on\nmobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\nDAU/MAU:    66%    67%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%\n…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    7…    D…    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…    …    7…\n…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    6…    D…    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…    …    6…\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 5% to 1.93 billion on aver age during December 2021 from 1.84 billion during December\n2020. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2021, relative to the same period in 2020.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 2.91 billion MAUs, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2020. Users in India,\nVietnam, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.\n57\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are\ndelivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nWhile the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate\nthat revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total\nrevenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our\nFamily products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize\nusers in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &\nCanada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile\nadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2021 in the United States & Canada region was more than 12 times higher\nthan in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $8.52    $6.95    $7.05    $7.89    $10.14    $9.27    $10.12    $10.00    $11.57\n$      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      …        …        …        …        $      $\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA\nOther revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue\nfrom various other sources.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the\ngeographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our\nrevenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based\non the addresses of our customers.\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $40.96, an\nincrease of 28% from 2020. For 2021, ARPU increased by 40% in Rest of World, 35% in Europe, 31% in the United\nStates & Canada, and 26% in Asia‑Pacific, as compared with 2020. In addition, user growth was more rapid in\ngeographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the\nfuture will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may\ncontinue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if\nARPU increases in each geographic region.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when\napplicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider\nthese to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating\nwhether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis.\nIn this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred\nto the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory\nrisk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent\nin a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Equity Investments\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative,\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may\nrequire judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as\nvoting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable\nprice for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal\nor most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely\nreporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the\ntransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a\nperiod subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative\nassessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook;\nindustry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash\nflows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we\nestimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and\nrecognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the\ncarrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash\nflows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate\n60\nTable of Contents\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development\ntax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our\nactivities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for\nour uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with\nthe income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the\nrefinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is\nmade, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated\nUseful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to\nmake significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in\nvaluing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected\ncash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant\nperspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based\n61\nTable of Contents\nupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,\nactual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and\nliabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the\nuseful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the\nmeasurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We\nhave two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill\nhas been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not\nrecorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per\ndiluted share. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of\nthe effective dates of the changes and applying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional\ninformation regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment.\n62\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile\napplications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. We calculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered,\nrepresenting the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as\nimpression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on\na net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and\nrevenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest , Facebook Portal, and\nwearables, and related software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution\nof our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related\nexpenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition\ncosts and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and\ncontent costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which\ninclude share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who\nare responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, and professional services.\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses and\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales\nsupport, marketing, business development, and customer service functions.

The increase was mostly driven by an\nincrease in advertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2021 increased $30.76 billion, or 37%, compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the\naverage price per ad and the number of ads delivered. In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as\ncompared with a decrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly\ncaused by a recovery from declines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, overall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products\nand in all regions in part due to the continued growth of online commerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered\nincreased by 10%, as compared with an approximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in 2021\nwas driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. We anticipate\nthat future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.\n65\nTable of Contents\nReality Labs\nRL revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 100%, from 2020 to 2021, and $638 million, or 127%, from 2019 to 2020. The\nincreases in both periods were mostly driven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold.\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and\na decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 31%, and\n19% between the third and fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while total revenue for the first\nquarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019 declined 7%, 16%, and 11% compared to the fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively. We note the decline in total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the non-seasonal\nimpact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to\nthe same period in 2020 had a favorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2021\nusing the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar,\nour total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $116.29 billion and $113.31 billion, respectively. Using\nthese constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.64 billion and $1.62 billion lower\nthan actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2021. Using the same constant\nrates, full year 2021 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $30.32 billion and $29.15 billion,\nrespectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                             2021 vs 2020       2020 vs 2019\n2021              2020              2019             % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nCost of        $        22,649         $  16,692         $  12,770                   36  %                  31%\nrevenue\nPercentage                      19%               19%               18%\nof revenue\nCost of revenue in 2021 increased $5.96 billion, or 36%, compared to 2020. The majority of the increase was due to\nan increase in Reality Labs cost of products sold and an increase in operational expenses related to our data\ncenters and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciation growth rate mostly due to\nincreases in the useful lives of servers and network assets. To a lesser extent, costs associated with partner\narrangements, including traffic acquisition and payment processing costs, also increased.\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the\nestimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\nIn 2022, we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and\ntechnical infrastructure to support user growth and engagement and the delivery of new products and services, and,\nto a lesser extent, due to higher content costs.\n66\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                              2021 vs 2020       2020 vs 2019\n2021              2020              2019              % Change           % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nResearch and    $        24,655         $  18,447         $  13,600                    34  %              36  %\ndevelopment\nPercentage                       21%               21%               19%\nof revenue\nResearch and development expenses in 2021 increased $6.21 billion, or 34%, compared to 2020.

The majority of the increases in loss from operations in both periods were\ndriven by increases in payroll and related expenses primarily due to the growth in RL research and development\nheadcount and higher gross losses from increases in volume of consumer hardware sales.\nInterest and other income, net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                             2021 vs 2020 %          2020 vs 2019 %\n2021       2020       2019               Change                  Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nInterest income,    $                461    $   672    $   904                  -31  %                  -26  %\nnet\nForeign currency\nexchange losses,                    -140       -129       -105                   -9  %                  -23  %\nnet\nOther income                         210        -34         27                       NM                      NM\n(expense), net\nInterest and\nother income,       $                531    $   509    $   826                    4  %                  -38  %\nnet\nInterest and other income, net in 2021 increased $22 million, or 4%, compared to 2020.

As a result, we recorded a total\nof $1.07 billion income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from\nacquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of\nchanges in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 28,\n2022 price, and absent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for\nthe full year 2022 to be similar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the\nmandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022, as required by the\n2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities\nbut also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the\nmandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points\nhigher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nSee Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding income tax contingencies.\n69\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated\nfrom operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks,\ninvestments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities,\nand investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $48.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $13.96 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily\ndue to $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $19.24 billion for capital expenditures,\nincluding principal payments on finance leases, and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nemployee restricted stock units (RSU) awards, offset by $57.68 billion of cash generated from operations for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our\nfederal net operating loss carryforward was $10.61 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $527\nmillion. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within\nthe next two years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million\nshares of our Class A common stock for $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available\nand authorized for repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $10.61 billion of the $48.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\nwas held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign\nearnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign\njurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our\noperational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the\nforeseeable future.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nNet cash provided by operating           $                   57,683    $   38,747    $   36,314\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                   -7,570    $  -30,059    $  -19,864\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                  -50,728    $  -10,292    $   -7,299\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $39.37 billion net income adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, including $9.16 billion of share-based compensation expense and $7.97 billion of\ndepreciation and amortization. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily du e to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation\nexpense and deferred income taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of $18.57 billion of purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure offset\nby $12.18 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing\nactivities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and\nequity investments, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $29 billion to $34 billion in 2022.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in\nfinancing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase in repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate\nresources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and\nequipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021          2020          2019\nNet cash provided by operating         $                   57,683    $   38,747    $   36,314\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property and                           -18,567       -15,115       -15,102\nequipment\nLess: Principal payments on finance                          -677          -604          -552\nleases\nFree cash flow                         $                   38,439    $   23,028    $   20,660\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures, or capital resources.\n71\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments.\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and\nland. Our other contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure\nand Reality Labs. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (in millions):\nPayment Due by Period\nTotal                        2022       2023-2024       2025-2026       Thereafter\nOperating lease\nobligations,             $  25,410    $                  1,559    $      3,966    $      3,837    $      16,048\nincluding\nimputed interest(1)\nFinance lease\nobligations,                 2,303                         678             603             322              700\nincluding\nimputed interest(1)\nTransition tax               1,537                           —             848             689                —\npayable\nOther contractual           23,080                      14,502           5,426             609            2,543\ncommitments\nTotal contractual        $  52,330    $                 16,739    $     10,843    $      5,457    $      19,291\nobligations\n_________________________\n(1) Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase\nrenewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components\nthat do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to\nsecure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated\nspend is approximately $8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on\nprevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nOur other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021.\nDue to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions\nis uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years\nbeyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal\nProceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n72\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\ninvestment risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, and $105 million were recognized in 2021, 2020,\nand 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and\ncash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $714 million and $794 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains\nor losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on\nthe carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and\nongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result\nin a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of\n$6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n73\nTable of Contents",

(the Company) as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n75\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company\naccrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When\napplicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss\nDescription of the Matter                   or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for\ncertain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of\nsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nloss contingencies was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments\nof the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential\namount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 11 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n76\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 2, 2022\n77\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 2, 2022\n78\nTable of Contents\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, Inc.\nto Meta Platforms, Inc. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer\ntogether. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nW e report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) . The\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where\nwe have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses\nof available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable, fair value of financial\ninstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations\nabout actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the\nestimated average useful lives of selected cohorts of servers and network assets from three yearsto four yearsin\nprior years as well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prior year changes\nindividually or in aggregate did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of\nthe 2021 changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $ 620million and an increase in net income of $\n516million, or $ 0.18per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact from the changes in our\nestimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying\nthe revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n85\nTable of Contents\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their\nrelationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue\nbased on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to\nour estimates of variable consideration.\nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and\nwearables, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is\ntransferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nRL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from\nvarious other sources.\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\nDeferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of\nrevenue recognition, revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL\nproducts. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make\npurchases in games on our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount\nwould then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred\nrevenue and deposits balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by cash payments from customers in\nadvance of satisfying our performance obligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized\nthat was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is\nnot significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or\nservices are delivered to the customer.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\n86\nTable of Contents\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as\ndepreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses\nwhich include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost\nof revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit\ncard and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria\nfor capitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four\nyears. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.99billion, $ 2.26billion, and $ 1.57billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized\nlosses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The\namounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not material. There was no\nimpairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable\nsecurities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income, net\non the consolidated statements of income.\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\nEquity Investments\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observable transactions\nfor identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in\ncarrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If\n88\nTable of Contents\nindicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the\ninvestment to fair value.\nIn addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy\nbecause their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing\nobservable market inputs.\nOur equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur,\nthe respective equity investment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the\nvaluation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other\nunobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable\nwere immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at\ncost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\n89\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets\nare described below:\nProperty and Equipment               Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets           Four years\nBuildings                            25to30years\nEquipment and other                  Oneto25years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets    Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements               Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges\nduring the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations,\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated\nor amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See section \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional\ninformation regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in\nprogress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\nservice for their intended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, land, colocations, network infrastructure, and\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is\na lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease\ncomponents and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such\nas contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such\nvariable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and\nequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU)\nassets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease\npayments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\n90\nTable of Contents\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent\nmaterial.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including\nwhen and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in\nparticular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on\nupdated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be\nthe result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it\ndifficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In\naddition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy\nregulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably\nexpect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future\nquarters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to\nreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration\nto identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not\namortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related\nexpenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nreporting unit level\n91\nTable of Contents\nannually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have tworeporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As\nof December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these\nintangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of\nthe cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and\neventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not\nrecoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We\nhave not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as\na finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the\nremaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2021, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of tax of $ 677million and as of December 31, 2020, we had a\ncumulative translation gain, net of tax of $ 439million.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income, net on our consolidated\nstatements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $ 140million, $ 129million, and\n$ 105million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents\nconsists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable\nsecurities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and\ndiversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\nnot material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 41%, 42%, and 43% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of\nrevenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada, Australia,\nBrazil, and Thailand.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n92\nTable of Contents\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic\n321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU\n2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting\nfor equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options\nin Topic 815. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible\nInstruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for convertible\ninstruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance\nalso eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and\nrequires the use of the if-converted method. The new standard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2022, with\nearly adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable\nLease Payments (ASU 2016-02), which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not\ndepend on an index or rate as an operating lease if specified criteria are met. The new standard was effective for\nus beginning January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets\nand Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a\nbusiness should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\n606) . This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business\nEntities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance\nreceived by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received;\n(2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial\nstatements. This guidance will be effective for us in the year ended December 31, 2022, with early adoption\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions).

As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we expect $ 517million of our deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year.\nNote 3.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings\nare allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities,\nincluding awards under our equity compensation plans.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the\nweighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\n94\nTable of Contents\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2021                     2020                     2019\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,383         432        2,407         444        2,404         450\nearnings per share\nBasic EPS               $                   13.99    $  13.99    $   10.22    $  10.22    $    6.48    $   6.48\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  33,328    $  6,042    $  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            6,042           —        4,539           —        2,916           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -93            —         -58            —         -18\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  39,370    $  5,949    $  29,146    $  4,481    $  18,485    $  2,898\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nShares used in\ncomputation of basic                        2,383         432        2,407         444        2,404         450\nearnings per share\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           432           —          444           —          450           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive                             44           —           37           —           22           1\nRSUs\nShares used in\ncomputation of                              2,859         432        2,888         444        2,876         451\ndiluted\nearnings per share\nDiluted EPS             $                   13.77    $  13.77    $   10.09    $  10.09    $    6.43    $   6.43\n95\nTable of Contents\nNote 4.

Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating\nentities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of\neach day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool,\nany overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Meta Platforms, Inc.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nWe have $ 23.08billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021, which are primarily\nrelated to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and Reality Labs. These commitments are primarily\ndue within five years.\n101\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, twoputative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,\nwith prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent\norder to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified\nconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of\nour directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders\nfiled an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary\nduty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and\nconsolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our\nregulatory compliance. The GDPR is still a relatively new law and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are\nsubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead\nto significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement\nof the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts\nfor loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a\nreasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material in the\naggregate.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and\ndisclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and\nrequests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as\nmisinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021,\nmultiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the\nprecise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to\ndisclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment\nof fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail\nagainst associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n102\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and\ngovernment inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our\nbusiness practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile\nor online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it\nhad opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair\nmethods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our\nplatform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by\nthe U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46\nstates, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the\nSherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access\nto our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram\nand WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our\ncompany's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or\nreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints\nfiled by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the\nattorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the\norder dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we\nfiled a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the\nFTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these\nacquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief.\nSeveral of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in\npart, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are\nvigorously defending them.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 — Income Taxes.\n103\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2021, there was not a reasonable possibility\nwe had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability\nfor costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2021.\nNote 12.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2021, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common\nstock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 2,328million shares of Class A common stock and 413million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, $ 8.60billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2021 and October 2021, additional $ 25.0billion and $\n50.0billion of repurchases were authorized under this program, respectively. In 2021, we repurchased and\nsubsequently retired 136million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 44.81billion. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, $ 38.79billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nSince 2020, we have maintained oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan,\nwhich was amended in each of June 2016, February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the\nissuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs,\nperformance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld\nin connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the\nAmended 2012 Plan.\n104\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 116million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number\nof shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term\nof the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to\nthis automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 20million shares of Class A\ncommon stock reserved for issuance effective January 1, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)                                    Per Share\nUnvested at December 31, 2020              96,733    $                                  181.88\nGranted                                    59,127    $                                  305.40\nVested                                    -44,574    $                                  198.95\nForfeited                                 -12,438    $                                  211.58\nUnvested at December 31, 2021              98,848    $                                  244.32\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n188.73and $ 173.66, respectively.

2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, primarily relating to U.S. state tax credit carryforwards and U.S. foreign tax credits for which we\ndo not believe a tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were $ 10.61billion and $\n2.11billion, which will begin to expire in 2028 and 2027, respectively, if not utilized. We have federal tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 527million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit\ncarryforwards of $ 3.18billion, most of which do not expire.\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations\ndue to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such\nannual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before\ntheir utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock\nownership change of greater than 50% over a three‑yearperiod.\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021        2020        2019\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑           $                    8,692    $  7,863    $  4,678\nbeginning of period\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                328         356       2,309\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                -86        -253        -525\npositions\nIncreases related to current year tax                              963       1,045       1,402\npositions\nDecreases related to settlements of                                -90        -319          -1\nprior year tax positions\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of    $                    9,807    $  8,692    $  7,863\nperiod\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our\nforeign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions,\nas well as for\n107\nTable of Contents\nthe uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of\nincome. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 960million and $\n774million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 9.81billion as of December 31, 2021 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 5.70billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years and by the Irish tax\nauthorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by\nthe IRS. Our 2019 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has\ndone so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer\nwas filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the\nNotice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and a second session commenced in October 2021.\nBased on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result\nin an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0billion in\nexcess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the\nIRS in the twoNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to\ntransfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2021, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the\nTax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of\nadditional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNote 15.\nSegment and Geographical Information\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on tworeportable segments: Family of\nApps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL\nincludes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. As of December 31, 2021 ,\nour operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using\ninformation about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. The CODM does not evaluate\noperating segments using asset or liability information.\n108\nTable of Contents\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with the partnership arrangements,\nconsumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments\nbased on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the\noperating segments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to\nthe operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities,\ninformation technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security\nexpenses, are mostly allocated based on headcount.\nThe following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions).\nFor comparative purposes, amounts in prior periods have been recast:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021         2020         2019\nRevenue:\nFamily of Apps                    $                  115,655    $  84,826    $  70,196\nReality Labs                                           2,274        1,139          501\nTotal revenue                     $                  117,929    $  85,965    $  70,697\nIncome (loss) from operations:\nFamily of Apps                    $                   56,946    $  39,294    $  28,489\nReality Labs                                         -10,193       -6,623       -4,503\nTotal income from operations      $                   46,753    $  32,671    $  23,986\nFor information regarding revenue disaggregated by geography, see Note 2 — Revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment,\nnet and operating lease right-of-use assets (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2021         2020\nUnited States              $        55,497    $  43,128\nRest of the world(1)                14,467       11,853\nTotal long-lived assets    $        69,964    $  54,981\n_________________________\n(1) No individual country, other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period\npresented.\n109\nTable of Contents",

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules\nand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs.",
