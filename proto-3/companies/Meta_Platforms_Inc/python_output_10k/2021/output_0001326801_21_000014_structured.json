          "content": "Business\nOverview\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nWe build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through\nmobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and\nlearn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and\nvideos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at\nlarge, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products, including:\nFacebook. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices\nand personal computers. There are a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook and build community,\nincluding Facebook News Feed, Stories, Groups, Shops, Marketplace, News, and Watch.\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. It is a place where people can\nexpress themselves through photos, videos, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite\nbusinesses and creators. They can do this through Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, IGTV, Live, Shops, and messaging.\nMessenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, video, and Rooms.\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses\naround the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\nFacebook Reality Labs. Facebook Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected,\nanytime, anywhere. Oculus Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) hardware,\nsoftware, and content, while Portal helps friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in\nmeaningful ways.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads enable\nmarketers to reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors.\nMarketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-\nparty applications and websites.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies\nproviding connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell\nadvertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing\nadvertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited\nto, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information\nonline or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Google, Apple,\nYouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people\nwho use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services,\nand to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our\nproducts. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products\nand services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies\nintroduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.\n7\nTable of Contents\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the\ncore of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases,\nand as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to\nexpand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to\ndevelop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security,\nprivacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against\nabuse.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to\nthem throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to\npost-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and\nresellers. We operate in more than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also\ninvest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will\ncontinue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the\nworld.\nIntellectual Property\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to\nfurther protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from\nthird parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or\ngroups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that\ncould harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection\nand personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing,\ndistribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure,\nartificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer\nprotection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or\nsanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In\nparticular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data.\nForeign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different\nobligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example,\nregulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent\nto various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely\naffect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove\nor restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications\nDecency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business\npractices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to\ntransfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we\nprovide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example,\nthe Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Facebook relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been\nsubjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the\nIrish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in\nrespect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such\ntransfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland\nchallenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in\nSeptember 2020. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data\ntransfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other\nalternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate material portions\nof our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of\nIDPC, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services\nused by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal\ndata of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union,\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took\neffect and imposes data privacy-related requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in\nBrazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain\ntransparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the\nEuropean Union's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of\nthese developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative\nproposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other\njurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability\nfor copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing\ndata protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around\nthe world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and\ncompetition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be,\nsubject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to implement\na comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated\nby, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated\ncivil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to\nchange our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to\nother structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAt Facebook, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we\nbelieve that people are at the heart of every connection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where\nideas, innovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design,\nmarketing, and other areas to further our mission.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe had a global workforce of 58,604 employees as of December 31, 2020, which represents a 30% year-over-year\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as\nwe continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a\nnumber of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review\ninitiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth.\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe.\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the\nlong term, we expect some personnel to transition to working remotely on a regular basis.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nDiversity and inclusion are core to our work at Facebook. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where\nwe can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the\nglobal community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\nWe publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually. In 2020, we announced\nthat as of June 30, 2020, our global employee base was comprised of 37% females and 63% males, and our U.S.\nemployee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 44.4% Asian, 41% White, 6.3% Hispanic, 4% two or more\nethnicities, 3.9% Black, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian\nor Other Pacific Islander). We also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made up of underrepresented\npopulations by 2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in leadership positions in the United\nStates, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also continue our ongoing efforts to increase\nthe representation of women in leadership.\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and\nhiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We\nhave seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this\napproach in 2015. We also continue to provide diversity and inclusion training for our recruiting team and develop\ninclusive internship programs. Facebook University, our training program for college freshmen and sophomores with\nan interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to promote participation by\npeople from underrepresented groups. To help build community among our people and support their professional\ndevelopment, we invest in our internal Facebook Resource Groups and our annual Community events such as Women's\nCommunity Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer\nManaging Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, and Be the Ally trainings to promote an inclusive workplace by\nhelping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias\nin the workplace.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they\ncan focus on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or\nsales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual\nequity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have\nconducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2020, we announced\nthat our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity across gender globally and race in the United States\nfor people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\nThrough Life@ Facebook, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones resources\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and\ntime away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, family care resources, a\n401(k) plan, access to tax and legal services, Facebook Resource Groups to build community at Facebook, family\nleave, and paid time off.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Additional risks and uncertainties that\nwe are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business\nobjectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and\nprospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners;\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\nour ability to compete effectively;\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\nvolatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in\nour service;\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to\nsell advertising, in their countries;\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\nFederal Trade Commission;\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our\nproducts, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance\nhas been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active\nusers of our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will\ngenerally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and we expect that the size of our\nactive user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where\nwe have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced\nsignificant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic trends, and\nin each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we experienced slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in\nthe number of daily active users on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the\nimpact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to\nbe subject to volatility. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may\nnot be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their\nengagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will\nnot experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have\nchanged over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different\nproducts and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\nincluding if:\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products\nor services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the\nfrequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared\non our products and services;\n13\nTable of Contents\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a\nvariety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our\nuser data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to\nprivacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is\nappropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with Facebook and our other products;\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may\nnot be featured or otherwise available;\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely\naffect our products or users;\nwe are unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe, or are otherwise limited in such\noperations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on\nStandard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union\nto the United States is invalid;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-\nfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or\ntake actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including\nas a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth\nand engagement;\nwe make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a\nresult of actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans,\nare discontinued;\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\naccessibility of our products in their countries;\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\n14\nTable of Contents\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry\nare the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user\ndata practices; or\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making\nit easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to\nvarying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our\nsignificant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be\nadversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products\nless attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our\nrevenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our active user growth rate continues to\nslow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and\nmonetization in order to drive revenue growth.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\nAs is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our\nmarketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not\ncontinue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not\ndeliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will\ngenerate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented, and we will continue to\nimplement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads,\nwhich has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we\nare unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or\nmay decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\nproducts;\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nadverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising,\nincluding developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize,\nincluding as a result of increased usage of the Stories format or our messaging products;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that\nprotect the security and integrity of our platform;\n15\nTable of Contents\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third\nparties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if\ncompetitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\nlimitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of European\nregulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon\nto transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of\nrisks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative\npublicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our\nefforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or\nrecommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web applications that are\nintegrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third\nparties, questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or\nuncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers announced that\nthey paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a\nresult of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with\nthe GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory\nactions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types\nof marketers or within particular geographies.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which\nmay reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of\nwhich would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have\naffected, and may in the future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we have seen with\nthe regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in\nadvertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our\nads, a related decline in pricing of our ads, and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of\nincreased usage of our services, and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or\nincrease the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user\nactivity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party\nmobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact,\nthe availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools\nthat incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our\nbusiness. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA,\nhave impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In\nparticular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in Europe following\nadoption of the GDPR, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in\nCalifornia following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to\nmake additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals. In\naddition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced product changes\nas well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target\nand measure advertising. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its\nproducts and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system that will reduce our\nand other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which we expect will in turn reduce the\nbudgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented,\nand may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to\nimprove ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our\nworldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have\nlimited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform, and negatively impacted our\nadvertising revenue, and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future,\nour targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn\nsignificantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile\noperating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature Facebook or our other products, or that mobile device users will\ncontinue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of Facebook\nand our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that\nwe do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or\ntechnical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset\nmanufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our\nproducts' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential\ntreatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or\ncharge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of\nFacebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update\nto its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most\nrelevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and more recently announced changes to iOS 14 that will limit\nour ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar changes to its, Google's, or other\nbrowser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and\nimpact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our\nproducts work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem\nor in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or\nstandards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on\ntheir mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use Facebook or our other products on their mobile\ndevices or use mobile products that do not offer access to Facebook or our other products, our user growth and user\nengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products\nor the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may\nadversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no\nassurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are\nadversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth,\nengagement, and monetization could be adversely affected\n17\nTable of Contents\nand our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the\nfuture may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and\nprofits.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our\nability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and\nin conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing\nproducts or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little\nor no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer\nhardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may\nnot be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new\nproducts, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also\ninvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to\nsupport increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and\nwe may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long\nterm. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage\nusers, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users\nor to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business\nmay be adversely affected.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce\nthe long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we\nbelieve that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will\nthereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will\ncontinue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively\ntarget ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of\ninformation about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking\nalgorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of\nreducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial\nresults. From time to time, we may also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to\nimprove ad quality and overall user experience. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other\nchanges to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and\ndevelopers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook or our other products. We also\nmay introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that\nattract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization. For\nexample, we previously introduced the Stories format, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as News\nFeed. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time\nthese efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in\nfavor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. These\ndecisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits\nthat we expect.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and\ndevelopers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of\nour new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our\nability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully. We may introduce new\n18\nTable of Contents\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive\nexperience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties\nthat advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny\nof our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and\nother issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID‑19 pandemic, which has in\nthe past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, in\nMarch 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or\nappropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or\ndevelopers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence\nin our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or\ninappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of\nour products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate\nopinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related\npurposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or\nobjectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States\nand around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent\nOversight Board, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who\nviolate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make\nsubstantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions, such as the\nforegoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and\nadvertising, hate speech, and other content, have eroded confidence in our brands, and if we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial\nresults may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web\napplications that integrate with Facebook and our other products.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and\nweb applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may\nnot be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user\nengagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled\nby third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are\ncontinuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal\nuser experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such\ndevelopers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these\ndevelopers to users on Facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and\nsuch actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile\nand web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety,\nand security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these\nactions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or\nwill adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or\ngrow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or\nif we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user\nengagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue\nand also exposes our business to other risks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or\nmitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity,\nquarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business\nslowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our\nbusiness and results of operations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10%\nyear-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering. While\nour advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent\n19\nTable of Contents\nquarters, there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In\naddition, we believe that the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to\nonline, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, which in turn have\nincreased demand for our advertising services; however, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue\nin future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely\nimpacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such\nimpact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our\nbusiness, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as\na result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\ndecreased user engagement as a result of users' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our\nproducts and services;\ninterruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from\nincreased usage, or product changes we implement to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the\nquality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;\ndelays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages, or diversion of our efforts and\nresources to projects related to COVID-19;\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising\npractices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or\nobjectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\nadverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of\nlimitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as\nthe necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to\nperform;\nour inability to recognize revenue, collect payment, or generate future revenue from marketers, including from\nthose that have been or may be forced to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;\nincreased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic;\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\nnegative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies,\ndelays, and disruptions in our business; and\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our\nfinancial statements.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory\nactions against us. The persistence of COVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread\nof the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate our business and may materially\nand adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as\ncompanies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for\nmanaging\n20\nTable of Contents\nand optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including,\nbut not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and\ninformation online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example,\nGoogle, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage,\nand retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and\nadvertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that\nintegrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual\nreality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as\nother companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in\ncertain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors\nmay be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to\ncompete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger\nusers, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our\nproducts and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products\nand services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other\nproducts and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly,\nin which case our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater\nacceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or\nmay adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas\nwhere we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\neffectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our\nproducts more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating\ncompeting platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\nsearch engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated\ncompetitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has announced changes to iOS 14 that\nwill limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads\neffectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we\ncannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control,\nincluding:\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our\ncompetitors' products;\nthe size and composition of our user base;\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\nproducts;\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their\ndata;\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\nour ability to monetize our products;\n21\nTable of Contents\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\ncustomer service and support efforts;\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide\nmarketers with a compelling return on their investments;\nour ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate\nwith Facebook and our other products;\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other\nproducts;\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\neffect on us;\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and\nproduct managers;\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become\nless attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and\nadversely affected.\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our\nprivacy practices, terms of service, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or\nregulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose\nproducts are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends,\nthe substance or enforcement of our community standards, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of\ncontent shared on our platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the\npast, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of\nsignificant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech,\nand other content, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics. In addition, we have\nbeen, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and\nother illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic\nand elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect\non the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which\ncould result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced\nsuch adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have\na limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future\nresults. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future\nperformance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in\nrapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of\nwhich we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;\n22\nTable of Contents\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result\nof the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\nchanges to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of\nadvertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\nmay introduce in the future;\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\nour competitors;\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations\nand to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or\ndecisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\ncosts and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop\nthe acquired technologies;\ncharges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in\na timely and cost-effective manner;\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of\ntime;\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\nactions;\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\n23\nTable of Contents\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or\nactions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in\njurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of\ndiscrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in\nthe period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate\nof that period;\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity\ninvestments, and in interest rates;\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\nchanges in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\nWe expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to decline\nover time in the future.\nWe expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nalthough we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty. In the long term,\nwe expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases,\nand the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly as we achieve\ngreater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our\nrevenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience volatility or decline, investors' perceptions of\nour business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and\naugmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not\nsuccessful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for\nexample with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and\npromote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and\nunproven technologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding\noperations, including our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time\nto time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\n24\nTable of Contents\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our\nbusiness. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies. Some of these\ninvestments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited\nrevenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such\ninvestments to continue for the foreseeable future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business\nand financial performance will be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could harm our financial\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other\nstrategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition\ncandidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, if\nat all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on\ninvestment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which\nhas occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result\nin increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other\nrestrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our\nexpenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,\ndevelopers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire\nthat were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our\ndue diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy\nand completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their\nrepresentatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail\nto accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and\naccounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our\nbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and\nsupport the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes\nsuccessfully. Our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to\ncompanies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience. We\ncontinue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which will result in significant\nongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We\ncannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we\nacquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant\ndisruption in our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a\npotential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of\nour products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not\nbe adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays\nor outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access\nthem, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at\nall, and our ability to serve ads may be\n25\nTable of Contents\ndisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As the amount and types of\ninformation shared on Facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our\nglobal community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an\nincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to\nsatisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical\ninfrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and\nadvertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism,\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. If such an\nevent were to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our\ntechnical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely\naffect our financial results.\nFor example, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our\ntechnical infrastructure. Additional product development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on\nour technical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate these demands, including as a result of our reduced\ndata center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the\nservices we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could\nsignificantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with\nthe services they provide. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor\nshortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we\nmay not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be\nrequired to procure such services or equipment on unfavorable terms.\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily\nthrough data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure\nexpansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in\nemerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges,\namong others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,\nincluding due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of\ncomponents, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges\nor actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to increased\nproject costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or\nreliability of our products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related\nto this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the\nuser experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United\nStates, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to such government action, could\nresult in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade\nthe quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of\nthese events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user\n(ARPU)) and Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)), are calculated using internal company\ndata based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable\nestimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring\nusage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to\nmeasure these metrics require\n26\nTable of Contents\nsignificant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or\nchanges in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time\nwe discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data\nlimitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do\nnot intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within\nthe error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third\nparties due to differences in methodology.\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our\nMAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide\n\"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles\nfor a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a\nPage rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user\nprofiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and\nspam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate\naccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts\nwe look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of\naccess to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work\nremotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates\nof duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the\napplication of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously\nundetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users.\nDuplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number\nof duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such\nas the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated\nthat false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts\ncan vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more\nfrequently in specific countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user\naccounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our\nusers, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates\nof the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total\nnumber of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our\ncommunity. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their\naccounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within\nand across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms\nand machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching\nmultiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are\nattributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models\nrequire significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject\nto statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based\non user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of our\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to\nindividual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible\nthat our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n27\nTable of Contents\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We\napply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user\naccounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device\ninformation, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of\nvarying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of\nsuch user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of\nour business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a\nvariety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products\ncompared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data\nsignals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our\nFamily metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of\ncalculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics,\nwhether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies,\nproduct changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our\nability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users.\nIn addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\"\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an\ninternal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination.\nFor example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that\nappear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include\nsuch person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not\nconstitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take\nother actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP\nestimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting\nsolely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and\nit is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while\nuser-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a\ndisproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of\nusage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors,\nsuch as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the\nuser's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our\nmetrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location\nand revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those\nrelating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human\nerror. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where\nwe discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may\nbe harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to Facebook or\nour other products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number\nof employees increasing to 58,604 as of December 31, 2020 from 44,942 as of December 31, 2019, and we expect\nheadcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives\nas well as other functions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products\ncreate significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple\nrelationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of our\nthird-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and\nprocedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of our management do not have\nsignificant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such\ngrowth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact\nproductivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some\npersonnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating\nrecently hired personnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a\nremote work environment; improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively\nexpand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement\nmore complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits\nof our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This\ncould negatively affect our business performance.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have\nmore limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that\ncould affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different\nlanguages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international\nmarkets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are\ngenerally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain\nmarkets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and certain of our other products are not\ngenerally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If\nwe fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In\naddition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\ncompliance, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, and infrastructure matters;\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\nlanguages and countries;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n29\nTable of Contents\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, data\nlocalization, payments, and regulatory oversight;\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure,\nand legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from\npersonnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations\napplicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage\nour obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls, sanctions, and embargoes, including\nregulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a\nbroad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-\ncorruption laws or regulations, export controls, and other laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in\nthe future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software\nused in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures\nto meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. We may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain that\ncould result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be\nnegatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on\nreasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties,\nmanufacturing constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may\nbe negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by\ngovernments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment,\nand business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws,\nfails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as\nunethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines,\ncanceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\n30\nTable of Contents\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending\npatterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand\nfor our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of\nsale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer\nhardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and\nmeeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer\nhardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,\ndetermine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable.\nAny one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time\nconsuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits,\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate\nthat we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user,\nadvertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous\nmonetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the\npast, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising,\nantitrust, privacy, content, employment, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer\nhardware and software, as well as virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example,\nwe are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data\npractices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; and our acquisitions\nof Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct. We also agreed to settle certain\nlawsuits in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature on Facebook and a third-party cyber-\nattack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile\ninformation from user accounts on Facebook. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages\nor fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any\nlawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a\nparty may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of\nsubstantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which\nhas occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure\nand intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage,\nprotect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to\ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal,\nstate, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including\nour methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a\nreview or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on\nour business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and\n2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are\nlitigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may\nadversely affect our financial results.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant\njudgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our\nprovision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such\noperations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our\nprovision for income taxes and estimates of\n31\nTable of Contents\nour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our\nfinancial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such\ndetermination is made.\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit\nsplit, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws,\ncould materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective\ntax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to\nthe Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States, could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect. In addition,\nmany countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or\nrecommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\nProject, and issued a report in 2015, an interim report in 2018, and blueprints in 2020 that, if implemented, would\nchange various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we do business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals\nthat would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include\nchanges to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of\nnon-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several countries have proposed or\nenacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on social media platforms and\nonline marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and\nconcluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These\ninvestigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to\nthe taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount\nof non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the\namounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax\nrate. For example, in 2020, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision\nfor income taxes by $656 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate\nwithout such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based\ncompensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based\ncompensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of\nshare-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do\nnot control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely\naffect our financial results.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIf our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant\ncharge to earnings.\nWe review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill\nfor impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an\nimpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in\nwhich any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect\nour results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel\nin the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies\nand systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our\noperations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to\nmaintain our competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical\npersonnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such\npersonnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, whether as a result of\ncompetition with other companies, challenges due to the high cost of living, facilities and infrastructure\nconstraints, or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue\nsignificant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial\nadditional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price\nvolatility. As a result of these factors, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our\nemployees. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and\nmotivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock.\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change\nof control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders\nsupport, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our\nother stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from\nacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might\nharm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the\nmanagement and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to\ncontrol the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated.\nAs a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith\nin a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a\ncontrolling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control\nas governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our\nstockholders generally.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will\ndiminish our cash reserves.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date,\nthe program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\nshares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will\nenhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase\nvolatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of\nour stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, or that otherwise\nimpair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial\nresults.\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country,\nrestrict access to our products from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the\naccessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user\naccess to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user\naccess to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for\nother reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to\ntime. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the\nability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found\nto be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to\nor elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National\nSecurity Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. It is also possible that\ngovernment authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where\naccess to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue\nfrom a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese\ngovernment could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of\nthe trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or\nelsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which\ncould adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal\nrequirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate\nour Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that\ncontent shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in\nwhole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic\nmarkets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other\nrestrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by\nmarketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use\nand data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and\nregulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business\npractices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to\nour business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content,\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data\nlocalization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications,\ncompetition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce,\ntaxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our\nactivities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws,\nregulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and\nother laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private\nparties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a\nresult, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,\nparticularly in the new and\n34\nTable of Contents\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to\ncountry and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions\naffecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could\nadversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services\nor adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between\ncountries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the\nEuropean Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the\nUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to transfer such\ndata, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the\nUnited States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU\nupheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs is contingent on SCCs being held to\nsatisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory\nguidance (and the European Commission has recently proposed new SCCs, which are currently subject to consultation).\nIn addition, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded\nthat Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR\nand preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should\ntherefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review\ncommenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in\nrespect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary\nor lift this order), which we expect to occur in the coming months. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases\nfor data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to\nrely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we\nmay be unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the\nPrivacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and\nother jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its\nsharing of certain data with other Facebook products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the\nSupreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we\noperate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to\nprovide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could\nadversely affect our financial results.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services\nused by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal\ndata of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As\na result, we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in\nEurope that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the GDPR. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to\nexisting and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. In addition, the GDPR\nrequires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator, the IDPC,\nand includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\nrequirements of the regulation. Similarly, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and\nimposes data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and\ncreates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability to control how their data is shared with third\nparties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will\ncontinue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, regulators have recently issued new guidance\nconcerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. In\naddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across\nmessaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\npractices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a\nnumber of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as\nwell as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In\naddition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity\nof delivering our services.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased\ncompliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational\nharm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business,\nincluding fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and\nwe expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness.\nFrom time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding\nour compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and\nexpect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information,\nactions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data\nprotection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our\noperations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent\ndecrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and\nother jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways\nin which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition,\nbeginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the\nUnited States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and\npolicies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which\nwas approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC\nrequired us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy\ncompliance and oversight. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to IDPC and other government\ninquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal\nuser access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also\nnotify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches\nand privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory\ncompliance.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and\ninvestigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to\nmany aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such\ninquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation\nof our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries\nand investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys\ngeneral. In December 2020, the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the\nDistrict of Columbia filed complaints against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging\nthat we violated antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions\non access to our platform, among other things. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent\ninjunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including\ndivestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp.\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could\ncause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties\n(including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner\nmaterially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time\nto time.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business\npractices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and\nfinancial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the\nworld, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are implementing a comprehensive expansion of\nour privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order, including substantial management and board of\ndirectors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making\nmisrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to\nthe FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and\nwill continue to be challenging and costly to implement. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing\ndemand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in\ncompliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist\nwith these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business\ninitiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some\npractices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe\nour ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will\ncontinue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require\nsignificant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent\norder and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time\nto time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or\notherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In\naddition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant\nchange and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the\nFTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are\nfound to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or\ngovernmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other\npenalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published\nusing our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our\nplatform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such\ninformation or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation,\ndissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of\npublicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, and breach of\ncontract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws\nthan we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive expanding\nonline platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which\nmember states are required to implement by June 2021. In addition, the European Union revised the European\nAudiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to\nimplement by 2021. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various Congressional and executive\nefforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce\nlistings, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for\nthird-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating\nand defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders\nrestricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of\ncontent hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany has in the past, and may in the future, result\nin the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and\ndisclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have\nimplemented similar legislation imposing penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for\nfailure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fines\nand may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey. In\naddition, Australia recently announced proposed legislation that would, among other matters, require us to pay\npublishers for certain\n37\nTable of Contents\nnews content that is shared on Facebook and Instagram. Content-related legislation also has required us in the\npast, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our compliance\ncosts, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example,\nthe European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content\nor to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial\ninvestments in compliance processes. In addition, changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act may\nincrease our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\nadversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\nOur users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments\ninfrastructure on the Facebook website. In addition, certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure,\nincluding on Messenger and WhatsApp, for other activities, such as sending money to other users and making\ndonations to certain charitable organizations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing,\nmoney transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, charitable\nfundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves, we may also be\nsubject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase\nflexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain\nmoney transmitter licenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-money) license that allows us to conduct\ncertain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the European Economic Area, which\nwill generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts\nto comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and\nmay still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or\nregulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order,\nor we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including:\nincreased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or\ncustomer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third\nparties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and\nreporting requirements. We have also launched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans\nto develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and\nadditional licensing requirements.\nOur participation in the Diem Association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIn June 2019, we announced our participation in the Diem Association, which will oversee a proposed digital\npayments system powered by blockchain technology, and our plans for Novi, a digital wallet for Diem which we expect\nto launch as a standalone application and subsequently in Messenger and WhatsApp.\nDiem is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based\npayments are uncertain and evolving. Diem has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in\nmultiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. As a sponsor of the initiative and a proposed\ndigital wallet service provider, we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators,\nand adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely\naffect our reputation and harm our business.\nAs this initiative evolves, both Diem and Novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United\nStates and international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, anti-money\nlaundering, counter-terrorism financing, economic sanctions, data protection, tax, and competition. In many\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with\nrespect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. To mitigate\nregulatory uncertainty, Diem has applied for a payment system operator license with the Swiss Financial Market\nSupervisory Authority (FINMA), and Novi has applied for money\n38\nTable of Contents\ntransmitter licenses in the United States and certain other countries, and other financial services licenses in\ncertain other countries, that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in these countries using the Diem\nnetwork. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or\nimpede the launch of the Diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services,\nincrease our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty. As such,\nthere can be no assurance that Diem or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely\nmanner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based payments technology, which may\nadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services. We will also incur\nincreased costs in connection with our participation in the Diem Association and the development and marketing of\nassociated products and services, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely\naffect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on\nour systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or\nto disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing,\nand transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper\naccess to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information\nfrom users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or\nother misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In\naddition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), scraping, and\ngeneral hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will\noccur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user\naccounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading\nmisinformation, or other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types\nand volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services\n(including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive\ntarget for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or\notherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of\nretaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user\nexperience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or\nresult in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to\ndisable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical\nmalfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our\nvendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our\nfacilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to\nfraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users'\ndata. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for\nlong periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and\nuser data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or\ndetect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be\nable to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads,\nmay receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with\nFacebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us.\nHowever, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in\nthe event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed.\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur\nsignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as\nobligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities\ncould initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches\nor improper access to or disclosure of data,\n39\nTable of Contents\nwhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in\norders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate\nsuch incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile\ninformation from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could\nsubject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the security of\nour systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly. The rapid\nadoption of some third-party services designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce\nsecurity risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased\ncyber-attacks, such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for\ntargeting our personnel.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify\nadditional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy,\nsafety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties,\nincluding investigations and audits of platform applications. As a result of these efforts we have discovered and\nannounced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user\ndata or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as\na result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the\nscale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19\npandemic, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents\nor activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media,\nor other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of\nuser data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or\nundesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's\nsafety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading\nmisinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect\nour business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and\nattention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and\ninternal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage\nimmense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain,\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise\nour ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and\nmay only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September\n2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in\nthe past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers\nwho use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms,\ncontracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors,\ncompromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions\nin our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how\ntheir data will\n40\nTable of Contents\nbe used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that\nmay prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or\ndefects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the\ntechnical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill\nour commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to\nour reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability\nfor fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright,\npatent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and\ninternationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property,\nand we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions\nand have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly\ninfringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future\ntrademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may\nnot be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these\ncases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our\nrights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In\naddition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we\ndeveloped available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of\nour open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and\ncompetitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these\nevents could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights\nclaims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\nand trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or\nother violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own\npatents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to\nextract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products,\nincluding in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other\nintellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products\nand services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number\nof intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we\nexpect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other\nintellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and\nthere can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may\nseek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation,\nincluding potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to\nsettle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are\na party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal.\nThe terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\nviolation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop\nalternative non-infringing technology or\n41\nTable of Contents\npractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could\nrequire significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise\nnegatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such\ndisputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of\nour Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our\nstock price has ranged from $17.55 to $304.67 through December 31, 2020. In addition to the factors discussed in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet\nthese projections;\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any\nsecurities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\ninvestors;\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base,\nthe level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\nour developers and competitors;\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a\nwhole;\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\nadverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition,\ncontent, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other\ndisruptive external events, or responses to these events.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to\nsecurities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, as well as the\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018. We may experience more such litigation following\nfuture periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and\nthe attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do\nnot expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a\nreturn on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders\nwho hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and\ntheir affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B\ncommon stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are\nable to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common\nstock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated\ncontrol will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable\npurposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\nincreasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an\nextended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of\nour outstanding capital stock.\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or\notherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a\ncompensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating\nfunction. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders,\nthe other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nall of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender\noffer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a\nchange of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current restated certificate\nof incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult,\nincluding the following:\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\n43\nTable of Contents\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company\nrequires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the\napproval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\nby written consent;\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are\nauthorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be\nestablished, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n44\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Legal Proceedings\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27,\n2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were\ntransferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019,\nthe district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to\namend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class\naction. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with\nleave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities\nclass action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our\nplatform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer,\nbecame the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries\nin the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified\nconsent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020.\nAmong other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Any other government inquiries regarding\nthese matters could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business\npractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California by Facebook users alleging that the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the\nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 16, 2018,\nthe district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both\nparties' motions for summary judgment. On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our\npetition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On August 8, 2019, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme\nCourt seeking review of the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties\nagreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a payment of $550 million by us and\nwas subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and\nplaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the\ndistrict court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July 22, 2020, the parties executed an amended\nsettlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval.\n45\nTable of Contents\nBeginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States and elsewhere against us alleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action\nin connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user\naccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified\ndamages and injunctive relief. The actions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court certified a class for injunctive\nrelief purposes, but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the\nparties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted\npreliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. We believe the remaining\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-\nattack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries. Any such\ninquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert\nresources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data\nProtection Regulation, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and\ninvestigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a\npreliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on Standard\nContractual Clauses in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily\nproposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be\nsuspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in\nthe Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in respect of the\ninquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary or lift this\norder), which we expect to occur in early 2021. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data\nprotection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any\nsuch inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business\npractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations,\nformal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such\ninvestigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation\nof our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram\nin 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the\nthird quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and\nstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the\nDistrict of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging\nthat we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in\n2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that\nwe violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys\ngeneral both seek a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other\nequitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class\nactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of\nantitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive\nconduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we\nare vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to\nsubstantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources\nand the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and\nother regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of\nour legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user\ninformation in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and\npenalties against us. We believe we\n46\nTable of Contents\nhave multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we\nintend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional\nlegal proceedings and disputes.",

We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities\nreduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and\nprovides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and\nequipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with\nour senior management and board of directors.\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended\nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating\nactivities:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020          2019          2018         2017         2016\n-in millions\nNet cash provided by\noperating                      $                   38,747    $   36,314    $   29,274    $  24,216    $  16,108\nactivities\nLess: Purchases of property\nand                                               -15,115       -15,102       -13,915       -6,733       -4,491\nequipment\nLess: Principal payments on\nfinance                                              -604          -552             —            —            —\nleases\nFree cash flow                 $                   23,028    $   20,660    $   15,359    $  17,483    $  11,617\n51\nTable of Contents",

In addition to our historical consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and\nbeliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other\nData\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain revenue information in the section entitled \" — Revenue — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue\" is presented\non a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant\ncurrency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthly exchange rates for our settlement\nor billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered\nin isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its\nusefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for\nyear-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency\nexchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides\ninvestors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison\nof financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows\nfor greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2020 Results\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2020 are as follows:\nCommunity growth:\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.84 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-\nyear.\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-\nyear.\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.60 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 15% year-over-\nyear.\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nFinancial results:\nRevenue was $85.97 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $84.17 billion, up 21% year-over-\nyear.\nTotal costs and expenses were $53.29 billion.\nIncome from operations was $32.67 billion and operating margin was 38%.\nNet income was $29.15 billion with diluted earnings per share of $10.09.\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.72 billion.\nEffective tax rate was 12.2%.\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nHeadcount was 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 30% year-over-year.\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health\nresponse, and working on the economic recovery. We have also continued to invest based on the following company\npriorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including\nprivacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set\nthe stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions\nof businesses that rely on our\n52\nTable of Contents\nservices to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our\nservices play in the world.\nIn 2020, we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products\nto connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.\nOur business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous\npreventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions,\nlimitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are\ncontinuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have\nsignificantly impacted our business and results of operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we\nexperienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic\ntrends, particularly in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on\nuser growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related\ndecline in the pricing of our ads, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. More recently, we believe the\npandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing\nconsumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for\nadvertising as a result of these trends. However, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in\nfuture periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our\nadvertising revenue growth. The impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of\nour advertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely\naffected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory\nenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nWe intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional\ninvestments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling\nour headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021. We expect 2021 capital\nexpenditures to be in the range of $21-23 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $68-73 billion.\n53\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users\non Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively,\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able\nto show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and\ncapital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on\nmobile devices.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited\nFacebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered\nFacebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on\nFacebook.\nDAU/MAU:    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    66%    67%    66%    66%    66%\n…        …        …        …\n…        …        …        …\nNote: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and\nTurkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n54\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide DAUs increased 11% to 1.84 billion on average during December 2020 from 1.66 billion during December\n2019. Users in India, the Philippines, and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December\n2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who\nvisited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a\nregistered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our\nglobal active user community on Facebook.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 2.80 billion MAUs, an increase of 12% from December 31, 2019. Users in India,\nIndonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\nWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions\nare delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as\nour total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the\ngeography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above.\nThe share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our\nusers affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at\ndifferent average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively\nhigher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in\n2020 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.\nARPU:    $7.37    $6.42    $7.05    $7.26    $8.52    $6.95    $7.05    $7.89    $10.14\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\n…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    $…    A…    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…    …    $…\nNote: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our\nestimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This\nallocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements\nwhere revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $32.03, an\nincrease of 10% from 2019. Over this period, ARPU increased by 18% in the United States & Canada, 15% in Europe,\nand 9% in Asia‑Pacific, and ARPU was flat in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies\nwith relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will\nbe primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to\nincrease at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases\nin each geographic region.\n57\nTable of Contents\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users\non our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other\nactivities on our Family products.\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number\nof ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our\nexpenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below)\naccess our Family products on mobile devices.\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these\nFamily products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not\nrequire people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our\ncalculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the\nunderlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within\nan individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and\ncounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey\ndata, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as\nmeasures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDAP/MAP:    77%    78%    78%    78%    78%    79%    79%    79%    79%\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error\nmargin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 4% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts\nwithin and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using\nour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020.\nWorldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019.\n58\nTable of Contents\nMonthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more\nFamily products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a\nweb or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common\nidentifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute\nmultiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people\nusing one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as\none person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of\nlimited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of\nerror in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our\nproducts. For additional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNote: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of\nunique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from\na periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates\ncontributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 3.30 billion MAP, an increase of 14% from 2.89 billion as of December 31, 2019.\n59\nTable of Contents\nAverage Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the\naverage of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue,\nthe number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the\ndefinition of MAP above. The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\nARPP:    $6.52    $5.66    $6.20    $6.33    $7.38    $6.03    $6.10    $6.76    $8.62\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $27.51, an\nincrease of 8% from 2019.\n60\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the\nlevels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such\nmatters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is\nmaterial . We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on\nour consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and\nestimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn response to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the assumptions and estimates\nassociated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material\nimpact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the duration or degree of the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\nCollectibility Assessment of Revenue\nUnder Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model. In step one, for a revenue contract to exist, it\nmust be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected. In\nperforming such collectibility assessment, we consider various facts and circumstances including future\nexpectations about our customer's ability and intention to pay. Collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold\nwhich requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors, such as probability of default,\ncustomer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks. The\ncollectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.\nCredit Losses of Accounts Receivable\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires the measurement and recognition of\nexpected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity does not expect to collect over\nthe asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nof future economic conditions.\nFor accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and\nincorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses.\nThese macroeconomic variables may vary by geography, customer-type, or industry sub-vertical. The contractual life\nof our trade accounts receivable is generally short-term; however, we may experience increasing credit loss risks\nfrom accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current\nassessment.\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, there is significant judgment in\nevaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a\nnet basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are\ntransferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment,\ninventory risk, and discretion in\n61\nTable of Contents\nestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could\nimpact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.\nValuation of Equity Investments\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative,\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may\nrequire judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as\nvoting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable\nprice for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal\nor most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely\nreporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the\ntransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a\nperiod subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative\nassessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook;\nindustry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash\nflows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we\nestimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and\nrecognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the\ncarrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash\nflows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that\nit is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there\nis a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose\nthe possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our\nprovisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings,\nadvice of legal counsel,\n62\nTable of Contents\nand updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated\namount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if\none or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses,\nour results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such\noutcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12—Commitments and\nContingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible\nassets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and\ntrade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair\nvalue are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable\nand, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable\nassets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized\nover the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During\nthe measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December\n31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The\nevaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying\namounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual\ndisposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is\nnot recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant\nimpairment charges during the years presented.\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining\nestimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts\nand circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as\nchanges to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we\nchange the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted\nfor prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in\nuseful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.\n63\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile\napplications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken\nby users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number\nof ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of\nour ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered,\nrepresenting the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as\nimpression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on\na net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices, net fees we\nreceive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution\nof our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure,\nsuch as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees\non our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with\npartner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs, credit card and other transaction fees\nrelated to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, share-based\ncompensation, and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible\nfor building new products as well as improving existing products.\nMarketing and sales.

Revenue in 2020 increased $15.27 billion, or 22%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly\ndue to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially\noffset by a decrease in the average price per ad.\nIn 2020, the number of ads delivered increased by 34%, as compared with approximately 33% in 2019. The increase in\nthe ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and\nan increase in users. In 2020, the average price per ad decreased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of\napproximately 5% in 2019. The decrease in average price per ad during the year ended December 31, 2020 was\nprimarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as Stories\nads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates.\nIn the near-term, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several\nfactors: the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of\ncommerce from offline to online, as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to\nservices, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus; and the extent to which changes to the regulatory\nenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers result in limitations on our ad targeting and\nmeasurement tools.\nAdvertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this\nseasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in\nadvertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth\nand subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 28%, 19%, and 23% between the third\nand fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of\n2020 and 2019 declined 16% and 10% compared to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2020 compared\nto the same period in 2019, had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year\n2020 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar, our total revenue and\n66\nTable of Contents\nadvertising revenue would have been $86.08 billion and $84.30 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates,\ntotal revenue and advertising revenue would have been $120 million and $129 million, respectively, higher than\nactual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020. Using the same constant rates, full year 2020\ntotal revenue and advertising revenue would have been $15.39 billion and $14.64 billion, respectively, higher than\nactual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019.\nCost of revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                             2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020              2019             2018              % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nCost of        $        16,692         $  12,770         $  9,355                    31  %                  37%\nrevenue\nPercentage                      19%               18%              17%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue in 2020 increased $3.92 billion, or 31%, compared to 2019. The increase was\nmostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, higher\ncost associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs and, to a lesser extent,\nan increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\nIn 2021, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and\ntechnical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and\nservices and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with partner arrangements and consumer hardware\ndevices.\nResearch and development\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                              2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020              2019              2018              % Change           % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nResearch and    $        18,447         $  13,600         $  10,273                    36  %              32  %\ndevelopment\nPercentage                       21%               19%               18%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Research and development expenses in 2020 increased $4.85 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019.\nThe increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40% growth in\nemployee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in engineering and other technical functions\nsupporting our continued investment in our Family of products and consumer hardware products.\nIn 2021, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our\ninvestment to support our research and development initiatives.\nMarketing and sales\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                            2020 vs 2019       2019 vs 2018\n2020             2019             2018              % Change       % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nMarketing       $        11,591         $  9,876         $  7,846                    17  %                  26%\nand sales\nPercentage                       13%              14%              14%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019. Marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased $1.72 billion, or 17%, compared to 2019. The\nincrease was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses, which were\npartially offset by a decrease in travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our payroll and benefits\nexpenses increased as a result of a 16% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020\nin our marketing and sales functions.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn 2021, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and\npartnership efforts, and we anticipate marketing expenses will increase.\nGeneral and administrative\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,                                           2020 vs 2019        2019 vs 2018\n2020             2019             2018             % Change            % Change\n-dollars in\nmillions\nLegal\naccrual\nrelated to      $              —        $   5,000         $      —                       NM                  NM\nFTC\nsettlement\nOther\ngeneral and                6,564            5,465            3,451                   20  %               58  %\nadministrat…\nGeneral and     $          6,564        $  10,465         $  3,451                  -37  %              203  %\nadministrat…\nPercentage                        8%               15%              6%\nof revenue\n2020 Compared to 2019.

Our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased $2.29 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019,\nmostly due to the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion and the effects of\na tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes,\nboth discussed below.\nOur effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the\nFTC settlement that was not tax-deductible, the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion, and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development\nexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, as part of finalizing our U.S. income tax return, we elected to capitalize and\namortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a total\nof $1.07 billion\n68\nTable of Contents\nincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred\nincome tax asset that was greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for\nthe periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax\nliability was accrued. We do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the\nfuture.\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v.\nCommissioner , which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share\nexpenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion ( Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a\ncumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer\nrequested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer\nrequested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020.\nSince we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation cost-sharing expense in the second quarter of\n2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in\n2020.\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the\nfollowing items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible\nincome, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from\nacquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of\nchanges in tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends\nupon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 22,\n2021 price, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the high-teens.\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions\nthat have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and\nour effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of\nthis impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well\nas the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.48 billion which\nwere accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties\nrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property,\nproviding services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate\nsettlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise\nchange the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of\ntax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12\nmonths.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not\nagree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January\n15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions of the trial began in\nFebruary 2020, and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021. The IRS did not provide any information\nabout how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe\nthat, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed\nU.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $680 million\n69\nTable of Contents\nin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not\nagree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the\nsecond Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes , that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in\nthe two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings\ncontinue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments\nto the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing\nof the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that\nthe balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number\nof years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full\nrange of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail\nin the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\n70\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a\npercentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within\nthe next three years.\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares\nof our Class A common stock for $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this\nprogram.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $7.18 billion of the $61.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\nwas held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign\nearnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign\njurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our\nplatform and user data practices, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. We paid\nthe penalty of $5.0 billion in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. On April 21, 2020,\nwe entered into a definitive agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries\nLimited. The transaction closed on July 7, 2020, and we paid approximately $5.8 billion at the then-current\nexchange rate.\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our\noperational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items,\nincluding $6.86 billion of depreciation and amortization and $6.54 billion of share-based compensation expense, and\noffset by a cash payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement. The increase in cash flow from operating\nactivities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items,\nsuch as depreciation and\n73\nTable of Contents\namortization, share-based compensation expense and deferred income tax, partially offset by the payment of $5.0\nbillion for the FTC legal settlement.\nCash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash\nitems, including $5.74 billion of depreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation\nexpense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to\nhigher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes\npayable as well as increases in the non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and share-based\ncompensation expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from $15.11 billion of purchases of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure, $8.16\nbillion of net purchases of marketable securities, and $6.36 billion of purchases of equity investments. The\nincrease in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of\nequity investments and in net purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchase of property and\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net\npurchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018\nwas mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $21 billion to $23 billion in 2021.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A\ncommon stock and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in\nfinancing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of our Class A common stock\nand in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion used to settle repurchases of our\nClass A common stock, and $2.34 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552\nmillion of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019\ncompared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures, or capital resources.\n74\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments.\nOur obligations under operating leases include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land,\ncolocations, and equipment. Our other contractual commitments are mostly related to our investments in network\ninfrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs, and data center operations. The following table summarizes our\ncommitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020:\nPayment Due by\nTotal                   Period\n(in millions)                     2021       2022-2023       2024-2025       Thereafter\nOperating lease\nobligations,\nincluding            $         20,751    $               1,316    $      3,017    $      3,065    $      13,353\nimputed\ninterest(1)\nFinance lease\nobligations,\nincluding                       1,088                      249             214             100              525\nimputed\ninterest(1)\nTransition tax                  1,543                        —             300           1,243                —\npayable\nOther contractual               7,504                    4,213           1,071             244            1,976\ncommitments\nTotal contractual    $         30,886    $               5,778    $      4,602    $      4,652    $      15,854\nobligations\n_________________________\n(1) Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of the business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to\npurchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally\nentered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume\nconsumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.94 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements\nmay vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\nOur other liabilities also include $3.48 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020.\nDue to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions\nis uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years\nbeyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some\nof which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it\ncould have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nSee Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal\nProceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n75\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity\ninvestment risk, and inflation.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results\nas expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains\nor losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than\nthe functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in\nthe future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign\ncurrency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of\noperations. Foreign currency losses of $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million were recognized in 2020, 2019,\nand 2018, respectively, as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and\ncash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits,\nmoney market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\ndebt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our\nliquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $794 million and $525 million in the market value of our\navailable-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any realized gains\nor losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on\nthe carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable market values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment\nconsiders factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry\nand sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and\nongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result\nin a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Our equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23\nbillion as of December 31, 2020.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n76\nTable of Contents",

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020,\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for\nleases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the\nrelated amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that:\n(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n78\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. The\nCompany accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and\nthe amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in\nsome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. For\ncertain of these matters, the Company discloses an estimate of the\nDescription of the Matter                   amount of loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred.\nHowever, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the\namount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss\ncontingencies related to the various legal proceedings was\nespecially challenging due to the significant judgment required to\nevaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss, and\ntheir estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the\nCompany's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of\npossible losses.\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence\nof a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses,\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the\nmeetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested\nand received internal and external legal counsel confirmation\nletters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss\nthe nature of the various matters, and obtained representations\nfrom management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the\nrelated disclosures included in Note 12 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n79\nTable of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The\nIRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years\nsubsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position,\nit could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus\nDescription of the Matter                   interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to\n(1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of\ntax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these\nuncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on\ninterpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to\nassess the technical merits of tax positions related to these\ntransfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions.\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for\nthese positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with\nour assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax\npositions. This included assessing the Company's correspondence\nwith the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit    or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting\nand receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We\nalso used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax\npositions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to\ndetermine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and\ntested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and\ncalculations. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nRedwood City, California\nJanuary 27, 2021\n80\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Facebook, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Facebook, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nJanuary 27, 2021\n81\nTable of Contents\nFACEBOOK, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nFacebook was incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and\nbring the world closer together. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Facebook, Inc., its subsidiaries where we\nhave controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. None of these\nreclassifications had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These\nestimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,\nvaluation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including\ngoodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives, collectibility of accounts receivable,\ncredit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, fair value of financial instruments, and leases. These\nestimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake\nin the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nwhich may cause further business slowdowns or shutdowns, depress demand for our advertising business, and adversely\nimpact our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we faced uncertainties around our\nestimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses. We expect uncertainties around our key\naccounting estimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic . Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such\nchanges are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements .\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through\nagent.\n88\nTable of Contents\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their\nrelationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the\ndelivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In\ngeneral, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is\ntransferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory\nbefore it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party\npublishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements\nwhere we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable\nconsideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts based on the expected\namount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our\nestimates of variable consideration.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) consumer hardware devices, net\nfees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\nDeferred revenue mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of revenue\nrecognition as well as revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various FRL\nproducts. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make\npurchases in games on our platform. Once this balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then\nbe payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue\nbalance for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying\nour performance obligations in FRL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that was included in\nthe deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is\nnot significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or\nservices are delivered to the customer.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or\nless. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the\nright to invoice for services performed.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products.\nThese include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility\nand server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations\nteams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements,\nincluding traffic acquisition\n89\nTable of Contents\nand content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of\nconsumer hardware devices sold.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted\nand available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria\nfor capitalization were not material to date.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to\nbe marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological\nfeasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization\nonce the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended.\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities\nfor the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets\nand liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in\ntax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely\nthan not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical\nlevels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\nposition. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based\nupon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions\nconcerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that\nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in\naccordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a\ntax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different\nfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n90\nTable of Contents\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated\nstatements of income.We incurred advertising expenses of $ 2.26billion, $ 1.57billion, and $ 1.10billion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90\ndays or less from the date of purchase.\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-\nsale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current\noperations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of\ntaxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with\nan amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference,\nif any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a\ncharge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining\nunrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders'\nequity. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material. There was no\nimpairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019 and 2018. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of\nmarketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other\nincome (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\nEquity Investments\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily\ndeterminable market values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement\nalternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The change in carrying value, if any, is\nrecognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically\nreview our equity investments for impairment. If indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is\nbelow the carrying amount, we will write down the investment to fair value.In addition, we also held equity\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Equity\ninvestments had a carrying value of $ 6.23billion and $ 86million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThere was no material impairment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair\nvalue as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for\nassets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most\nadvantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the\nlowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n91\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were\nderived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit\nlosses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical\nexperience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect\nour ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses\non our consolidated statements of income.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our accounts receivable, net were $\n11.33billion and $ 9.52billion, respectively, and the allowances of accounts receivable were immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets\nor the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\nProperty and Equipment                     Useful Life\nNetwork equipment                          Threeto20years\nBuildings                                  Threeto30years\nComputer software, office equipment and    Twotofiveyears\nother\nFinance lease right-of-use assets          Threeto20years\nLeasehold improvements                     Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful\nlives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ\nfrom the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations,\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life\nassumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated\nor amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in\nmaterial changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.\nLand and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to\nthe construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their\nintended use.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the\ncost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such\nsale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n92\nTable of Contents\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data center, land, colocations, and equipment leases. We\nalso have finance leases for certain network equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.\nMost of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and\naccount for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent\nrent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs\nare expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease\nliabilities.\nFor leases that have greater than 12-month lease term, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the\nconsolidated balance sheet at commencement date based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments. We\nconsider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based,\nasset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar\neconomic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating\nlease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\nequipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nResults and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic\n842 , while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 840.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that\narise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory\nobligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and\nunasserted, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a\nreasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the\npossible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and\nthe estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\nunasserted matters.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nintangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible\nassets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users,\n93\nTable of Contents\nacquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and\ndiscount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but\nwhich are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAllocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense,\nas acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived\nintangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one\nyear from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the\ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to earnings.\nLong-lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and acquired finite-lived intangible assets for possible\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from\nthe use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not\nrecorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December\n31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived\nintangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized\nbalance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the\nfinancial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December\n31, 2020 we had a cumulative translation gain, net of tax of $ 439million and as of December 31, 2019, we had a\ncumulative translation loss, net of tax of $ 617million. Net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions\nwere $ 129million, $ 105million, and $ 213million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively. These losses were recorded as interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements\nof income.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash,\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents\nconsists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable\nsecurities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment\ngrade corporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and\ndiversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was\nnot material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different\nindustries and countries. We generated 42% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 43% of our\nrevenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 from marketers and developers based in the United States,\nwith the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China,\nCanada, Australia, Japan, Vietnam and Brazil.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an\nallowance for estimated credit losses and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\n94\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our\noperating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nSegments\nOur chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer who makes resource allocation decisions and\nassesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis. There are no segment\nmanagers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, for operations, operating\nresults, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined\nthat we have a single reportable segment and operating segment structure.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFair Value Measurements\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair\nValue Measurements (Topic 820) , which improved the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and\nnonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements. The\nadoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCredit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326) : Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective transition method.\nUpon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a current expected credit losses (CECL) model in place of\nthe incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including our accounts\nreceivable. In addition, we modified our impairment model for AFS debt securities and to discontinue using the\nconcept of \"other than temporary\" impairment on AFS debt securities. CECL estimates on accounts receivable are\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Allowance for credit\nlosses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nexpected credit losses.\nIncome Taxes\nOn October 1, 2020, we early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying\nthe Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance was\neffective beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have\na material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-01,\nInvestments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity\nsecurities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for\ncertain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1,\n2021 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other\nOptions (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt\ninstruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for\nconvertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. This guidance will be effective for us in\nthe first quarter of 2022 on a full\n95\nTable of Contents\nor modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2.\nRevenue\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source consists of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nAdvertising      $                   84,169    $  69,655    $  55,013\nOther revenue                         1,796        1,042          825\nTotal revenue    $                   85,965    $  70,697    $  55,838\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the billing address of our customers, consists of the following (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020         2019         2018\nRevenue:\nUnited States and Canada(1)    $                   38,433    $  32,206    $  25,727\nEurope(2)                                          20,349       16,826       13,631\nAsia-Pacific                                       19,848       15,406       11,733\nRest of World(2)                                    7,335        6,259        4,747\nTotal revenue                  $                   85,965    $  70,697    $  55,838\n_________________________\n(1) United States revenue was $ 36.25billion, $ 30.23billion, and $ 24.10billion for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n(2) Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\nDeferred revenue and deposits consists of the following (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2020       2019\nDeferred revenue                       $           335    $   234\nDeposits                                            47         35\nTotal deferred revenue and deposits    $           382    $   269\nNote 3.\nEarnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for\nparticipating securities. We consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of\nsuch shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares.\nUndistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net\nincome attributable to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, adjusted\nfor outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase.\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the\neffect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans. In 2018, the calculation of\ndiluted EPS also included the effect of inducement awards under separate non-plan restricted stock unit (RSU) award\nagreements.\n96\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion\nof those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing\nthe resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common\nshares outstanding.\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation\nand dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December\n31,\n2020                     2019                     2018\nClass       Class        Class       Class        Class       Class\nA           B            A           B            A           B\nBasic EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income              $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,411    $  3,701\nLess: Net income\nattributable to                                 —           —            —           —           -1           —\nparticipating\nsecurities\nNet income\nattributable to         $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,410    $  3,701\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average                            2,407         444        2,404         450        2,406         484\nshares outstanding\nBasic EPS               $                   10.22    $  10.22    $    6.48    $   6.48    $    7.65    $   7.65\nDiluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income\nattributable to         $                  24,607    $  4,539    $  15,569    $  2,916    $  18,410    $  3,701\ncommon\nstockholders\nReallocation of net\nincome attributable                             —           —            —           —            1           —\nto participating\nsecurities\nReallocation of net\nincome as a result\nof conversion of                            4,539           —        2,916           —        3,701           —\nClass B to Class A\ncommon stock\nReallocation of net\nincome to Class B                               —         -58            —         -18            —         -16\ncommon stock\nNet income for          $                  29,146    $  4,481    $  18,485    $  2,898    $  22,112    $  3,685\ndiluted EPS\nDenominator\nNumber of shares\nused for basic EPS                          2,407         444        2,404         450        2,406         484\ncomputation\nConversion of Class\nB to Class A common                           444           —          450           —          484           —\nstock\nWeighted-average\neffect of dilutive\nRSUs                                           37           —           22           1           31           3\nand employee stock\noptions\nNumber of shares\nused for diluted EPS                        2,888         444        2,876         451        2,921         487\ncomputation\nDiluted EPS             $                   10.09    $  10.09    $    6.43    $   6.43    $    7.57    $   7.57\n97\nTable of Contents\nNote 4.

Based on our assessment, we concluded no change in fair value from the\ninitial carrying value of $ 5.82billion was required as a result of these observable transactions. Had there been a\nchange in the fair value, our investment in Jio would be classified within Level 3.

Noamount had been drawn down under this credit\nfacility, and it was terminated on December 24, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had nooutstanding long-term debt.\nNote 12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nGuarantee\nIn 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank\nprovider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal\nentities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating\nentities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of\neach day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool,\nany overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nWe also have $ 7.50billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly\nrelated to our investments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations.\nThe majority of these commitments are due within five years.\nLegal and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations\nof securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user\ndata practices as well as\n103\nTable of Contents\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and\npolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, twoputative class\nactions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers\nalleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second\nquarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These twoactions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described\nabove relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our\nmotion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a\nsecond amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the\ndistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16,\n2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data\npractices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve\nthe FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our\nsettlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the\neffectiveness of the modified consent order.\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California by Facebook users alleging that the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the\nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 16, 2018,\nthe district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both\nparties' motions for summary judgment. On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our\npetition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On August 8, 2019, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme\nCourt seeking review of the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties\nagreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a payment of $ 550million by us and\nwas subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and\nplaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the\ndistrict court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July 22, 2020, the parties executed an amended\nsettlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $ 650million by us. On August 19, 2020,\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. The\nsettlement amount is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet\nas of December 31, 2020.\nBeginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the\nUnited States and elsewhere against us alleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action\nin connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user\naccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified\ndamages and injunctive relief. The actions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court certified a class for injunctive\nrelief purposes but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the\nparties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted\npreliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. We believe the remaining\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-\nattack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries.\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data\nProtection Regulation, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and\ninvestigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. Although we are vigorously defending our\nregulatory compliance, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate potential loss related to the\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC could be material in the aggregate.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and\nother regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of\nour legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user\ninformation in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and\npenalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against\nassociated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n104\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a\nregular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With\nrespect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible\nloss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, from time to time we are subject to\nvarious litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in\nthe United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among\nother things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital\nadvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were\ninformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC\nfiled a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in\nanticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining\nconditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of\nantitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the\nattorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in\nviolation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining\nconditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by\nacquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction\nagainst our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture\nor reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and\nfederal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in\nconnection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and\ninjunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted\nlegal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government\ninquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments\non a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these\nother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these\nother matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of\nloss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is\nestimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts\nin excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15—Income Taxes.\n105\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses\narising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims\nmade by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and\nthe amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors,\nand certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2020, there was not at least a reasonable\npossibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded\nany liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2020.\nNote 13.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, we are authorized to issue 5,000million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141million shares\nof Class B common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.000006per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the\nrights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31,\n2020, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to onevote,\nwhile the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to tenvotes. Shares of our Class B common stock\nare convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares\nof our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common\nstock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 2,406million shares of Class A common stock and 443million shares of Class B\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $ 4.90billion remained available and\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2020, an additional $ 10.00billion of repurchases was\nauthorized under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for $ 6.30billion. As of December 31, 2020, $ 8.60billion remained available and authorized for\nrepurchases. In January 2021, an additional $ 25billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be\nrepurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of\ntrading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nIn 2020, we maintained oneactive share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was\namended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance\nof incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection\nwith the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012\nPlan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\n106\nTable of Contents\nShare-based compensation expense mostly consists of the Company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs\ngranted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service\nperiod of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 129million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number\nof shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term\nof the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the\nimmediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to\nthis automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 16million shares reserved for\nissuance effective January 1, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nNumber of Shares       Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair\n(in thousands)                                  Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2019              78,851    $                            165.74\nGranted                                    62,032    $                            188.73\nVested                                    -38,857    $                            162.27\nForfeited                                  -5,293    $                            165.72\nUnvested at December 31, 2020              96,733    $                            181.88\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019, and 2018 was $ 9.38billion, $ 6.01billion, and $ 7.57billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $ 16.50billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSUs\nawards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\napproximately three yearsbased on vesting under the award service conditions.\nNote 14.\nInterest

The amount of interest and penalties accrued\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 774million and $ 747million, respectively.\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 8.69billion as of December 31, 2020 were realized in a\nfuture period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 4.85billion within our provision of income taxes at such\ntime.\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v.\nCommissioner , which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share\nexpenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion ( Altera Ninth\nCircuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a\ncumulative income tax expense of $ 1.11billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer\nrequested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer\nrequested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020.\nSince we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation cost-sharing expense in the second quarter of\n2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in\n2020.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2016 and 2018 tax years and by the Irish tax\nauthorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by\nthe IRS. Our 2019 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with\nour foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to\nthe 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not\nagree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January\n15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial began in\nFebruary 2020 and a second session is expected to continue in 2021. It is not clear how the IRS intends to apply\nthe revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in\nits updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of\nup to approximately $ 9.0billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and\nany penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new\nadjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we\nclaimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal\ntax liability of up to approximately $ 680million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns,\nplus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and\nhave filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income\nTaxes , that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in\nthe two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a\nreduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings\ncontinue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision\nfor income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of\nyears remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments\nto the balance of gross unrecognized\n110\nTable of Contents\ntax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax,\ninterest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows.\nNote 16.\nGeographical Information\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment,\nnet and operating lease right-of-use assets, net (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nLong-lived assets:                    2020         2019\nUnited States              $        43,128    $  35,858\nRest of the world(1)                11,853        8,925\nTotal long-lived assets    $        54,981    $  44,783\n_________________________\n(1) No individual country, other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period\npresented.\n111\nTable of Contents",

Based on\nthe assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting,\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2020 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs.",
