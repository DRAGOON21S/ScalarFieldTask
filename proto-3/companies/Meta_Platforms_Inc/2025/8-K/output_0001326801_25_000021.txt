Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

As previously disclosed, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the "Company") maintains a Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") that
provides variable cash incentives, payable annually, which are designed to motivate its executive officers to focus
on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements. Payouts under the Bonus Plan are
calculated by multiplying (a) each executive officer's base eligible earnings times his or her target bonus
percentage and (b) the company performance percentage approved by the Compensation, Nominating & Governance
Committee (the "CNGC") of the Company's Board of Directors for the relevant annual performance period.

On February 13, 2025, the CNGC approved an increase in the target bonus percentage under the Bonus Plan for each of
the Company's named executive officers (other than its Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO")) from 75% of each such
named executive officer's base salary to 200% of each named executive officer's base salary, effective beginning
with the 2025 annual performance period under the Bonus Plan. The CNGC analyzes market data for executive
compensation at least annually, including based on input from its independent compensation consultant. In approving
this increase, the CNGC considered that the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other
than the CEO) was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding
similar positions at the peer group of companies that the Company benchmarks against for executive compensation
purposes (the "Peer Group Target Cash Compensation"). Following this increase, the target total cash compensation
for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group
Target Cash Compensation.
