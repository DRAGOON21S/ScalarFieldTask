              "content": "As previously disclosed, the Compensation, Nominating & Governance Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”) has authorized an overall security program for Mark Zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as Meta’s founder, Chairman, and CEO. Meta requires security measures for the company’s benefit because of the importance of Mr. Zuckerberg to Meta. The Committee regularly reviews Mr. Zuckerberg’s security program and the related costs, which vary from year to year depending on requisite security measures, Mr. Zuckerberg’s travel schedule, and other factors.",

                "mark_zuckerberg_security_allowance": "In 2018, the Committee approved an annual pre-tax allowance of $10 million to Mr. Zuckerberg to cover additional costs related to his and his family’s personal security. This allowance is paid to Mr. Zuckerberg net of required tax withholdings, and Mr. Zuckerberg must apply the net proceeds to pay for additional personnel, equipment, services, residential improvements, or other security-related costs. On February 9, 2023, the Committee approved increasing this annual pre-tax allowance to $14 million, effective immediately. In approving this increase, the Committee considered Mr. Zuckerberg’s position and importance to Meta and the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg has requested to receive only $1 in annual salary and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation. The Committee also considered Mr. Zuckerberg’s actual spend on security-related costs, comparative data from the peer group of companies that Meta benchmarks against for executive compensation purposes, and other relevant information regarding executive compensation and perquisites. The Committee believes that this increased allowance, together with the costs of Mr. Zuckerberg’s existing overall security program, are appropriate and necessary under the circumstances.",
                "susan_li_compensation": "In addition, on February 9, 2023, in connection with Susan Li’s previous appointment as Meta’s Chief Financial Officer, the Committee approved increasing her annual base salary to $900,000, effective February 27, 2023."
