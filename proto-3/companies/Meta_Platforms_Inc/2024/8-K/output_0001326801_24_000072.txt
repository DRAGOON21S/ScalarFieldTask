Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On September 5, 2024, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and
restated the Company’s bylaws (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”), which became effective as of such date. The
Amended and Restated Bylaws, among other things, enhance and clarify certain procedural and disclosure requirements
related to shareholder nominations of directors and submissions of proposals regarding other business at annual or
special meetings of shareholders, including with respect to the information about any such shareholders and their
affiliates required to be disclosed to the Company, the number of nominees that shareholders may nominate for
election, and certain other updates in light of the “universal proxy” rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-19 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Amended and Restated
Bylaws also include updates to matters related to meetings of shareholders, including who may preside over such
meetings, and certain other technical, clarifying and conforming changes, including updates to conform to the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

The foregoing summary of the Amended and Restated Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated in this Item 5.03 by reference.
