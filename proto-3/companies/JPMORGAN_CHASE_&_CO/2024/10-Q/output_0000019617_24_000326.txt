Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2023, unless
otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $13.4
billion, up 6%, earnings per share of $4.44, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%. The Firm's results included a $725
million increase to the FDIC special assessment in Corporate. • Total net revenue was $41.9 billion, up 9%,
reflecting: – Net interest income ("NII") of $23.1 billion, up 11%, driven by the acquisition of First Republic,
the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially
offset by deposit margin compression, and lower average deposit balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $23.0
billion, up 10%. – Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $18.9 billion, up 7%, driven by higher asset management fees,
lower net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, the impact of First Republic and higher investment
banking fees, partially offset by lower Markets noninterest revenue. • Noninterest expense was $22.8 billion, up
13%, driven by higher compensation expense, including an increase in employees, the impact of First Republic and
the $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment in Corporate. • The provision for credit losses was $1.9
billion, reflecting $2.0 billion of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $819 million, predominantly driven
by CCB, primarily Card Services. The prior year included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a $1.1 billion net
addition to the allowance for credit losses. • The total allowance for credit losses was $24.7 billion at March 31,
2024. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.77%, compared with 1.85% in
the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.3 billion at March 31, 2024, up 11%, driven by
wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflects downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and the impact of
First Republic. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 58-66 and pages 54-57,
respectively, for additional information. • Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 16%, predominantly
driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, primarily as a result of First Republic.
                                                         5                                                         
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up
2%, driven by:

– growth in CIB due to net issuances of structured
notes as a result of client demand, and net inflows in
Payments and Securities Services,

– the impact of First Republic, and

– an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives,

largely offset by

– a decline in CCB and AWM as clients seek higher-
yielding investments; in CCB, the decline in deposits
was also driven by increased customer spending; and in
CB, the decline was due to continued deposit
attrition.

• On April 8, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced that two
of its directors, Timothy P. Flynn and Michael A.
Neal, had decided to retire from the Board of
Directors of the Firm when their terms expire.

• On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange
offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all
outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock
(“Visa B-1 shares”). Holders participating in the
exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa
Class B-2 common stock (“Visa B-2 shares”) and Visa
Class C common stock (“Visa C shares”) in exchange for
Visa B-1 shares that are validly tendered and accepted
for exchange by Visa. The Firm has tendered its 37.2
million Visa B-1 shares, and that tender is pending
Visa’s acceptance. Upon acceptance by Visa of the
Firm’s tender, the Visa C shares received by the Firm
would be recognized at fair value, which is expected
to result in a gain that may be recorded as early as
the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 2 for
additional information.

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 82 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk
Factors on pages 9-33 of the 2023 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of certain of those risks and
uncertainties and the other factors that could cause
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results in 2024 will be in line
with the outlook information set forth below, and the
Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2024
should be viewed against the backdrop of the global
and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the FDIC, as
receiver.

JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as
of and for the period ended March 31, 2024 reflect the
impact of First Republic. Where meaningful to the
disclosure, the impact of the First Republic
acquisition, as well as subsequent related business
and activities, are disclosed in various sections of
this Form 10-Q. The Firm continues to convert certain
operations, and to integrate clients, products and
services, associated with the First Republic
acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and
operations. The Firm expects that these actions will
be largely completed by the end of 2024.

Refer to Note 26 and page 20 for additional
information related to First Republic.

On March 5, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau issued a final rule that lowers the threshold
at or below which large credit card issuers, including
the Firm, can charge late fees to customers on a "safe
harbor" basis. The final rule also eliminates an
automatic annual inflation adjustment for large credit
card issuers. The effective date of this rule is May
14, 2024. The Firm does not expect a material impact
to Firmwide net interest income.

Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees in creased,
reflecting in CIB: • higher underwriting fees that benefited from improved market conditions, and consisted of – an
increase in debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuance in leveraged loans and
high-yield bonds, as well as higher issuance in high grade bonds reflecting wallet share gains, and – an increase
in equity underwriting fees driven by IPO and convertible securities offerings, reflecting wallet share gains ,
partially offset by • lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of large completed transactions. Refer to CIB
segment results on pages 24-28 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue decreased,
reflecting in CIB the net impact of: • lower Fixed Income Markets revenue in Rates and Commodities, partially
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products, • higher Equity Markets revenue in Equity Derivatives and Prime
Finance, and • lower losses of $15 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared with losses of $153 million in
the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest
income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB
results on pages 24-28 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees incr eased,
reflecting: • higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on
certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, predominantly in AWM and CB, and •
higher other len ding- and deposit-related fees in CIB and CB. Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages
24-28, pages 29-31 and pages 32-34, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees
increased driven by strong net inflows and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB, as well as the impact of
First Republic in CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 21-23 and pages 32-34, respectively, and Note
5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees increased predominantly due to higher commissions from
annuity sales in CCB and higher custody fees associated with a higher level of assets under custody in CIB. Refer
to CCB and CIB Segment results on pages 21-23 and pages 24-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information.
Investment securities losses reflected lower net losses on sales of U.S. GSE, government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. R efer to
Corporate segment results on pages 35-36 and Note 9 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income
increased in Home Lending, reflecting higher production revenue, which included the impact of First Republic .
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 21-23 and Notes 5 and 14 for additional information. Card income decreased
due to an increase in new account origination costs, largely offset by higher annual fees, reflecting continued
growth in the portfolio, in CCB. Refer to CCB and CB segment results on pages 21-23 and page 29, respectively, and
Note 5 for additional information.

Other income incre ased predominantly driven by the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024, resulting in the amortization of certain of the Firm's alternative
energy tax-oriented investments previously recognized in other income now being recognized in income tax expense.
The prior year included net valuation gains in AWM, including $339 million on the original minority interest in
China International Fund Management (“CIFM”). Refer to AWM segment results on pages 32-34 for additional
information on CIFM; Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information on the adoption of updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance. Net interest income increased, driven by the acquisition of First
Republic, the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services,
partially offset by deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates paid across the LOBs, and lower average
deposit balances in CCB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $229 billion, and the
yield was 5.55%, up 87 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.71%, an increase
of 8 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.83%, up 3 bps. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 175 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on
pages 16-17 for a further discussion of net yield excluding Markets.

Quarterly results The provision for credit losses was
$1.9 billion, reflecting $2.0 billion of net charge-
offs, an increase of $819 million, predominantly
driven by Card Services, as the portfolio continued to
normalize. The allowance for credit losses was
relatively flat, reflecting: • a net reduction in the
allowance of $142 million in wholesale , which
included a net addition to the allowance for credit
losses associated with net downgrade activity, largely
in Real Estate, primarily in CB, which was more than
offset by the net impact of changes in the loan and
lending-related commitment portfolios, as well as
updates to certain macroeconomic variables, and • a
net addition of $44 million in consumer , consisting
of $153 million in Card Services, predominantly offset
by a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending. The
provision in the prior year was $2.3 billion,
reflecting a $1.1 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of
$1.1 billion. Refer to CCB segment results on pages

to income tax expense of approximately $450 million,
partially offset by • higher benefits related to the
vesting of employee share-based awards in the current

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased driven by CIB Markets activities and cash
deployment in Treasury and CIO.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher demand for securities to cover
short positions, as well as when compared with
seasonally lower levels at year-end. Refer to Note 10
for additional information on securities purchased
under resale agreements and securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased due to:

• higher levels of equity and debt instruments in
Markets, reflecting strong client-driven market-making
activities, and when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end, and to a lesser extent

• higher short-term cash deployment in Treasury and
CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities was relatively flat, reflecting:

• lower HTM securities as a result of maturities and
paydowns, and

• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities,
reflecting net purchases, partially offset by
maturities and paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 35-36,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 70, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans decreased, reflecting :

• a reduction in Card Services due to the impact of
seasonality,

• a decline in Home Lending as sales outpaced
originations, and

• lower wholesale loans in AWM due to paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses was relatively flat ,
reflecting:

• a net reduction of $92 million in wholesale , which
included a net addition to the allowance associated
with net downgrade activity, largely in Real Estate,
primarily in CB, which was more than offset by the
impact of changes in the loan portfolios as well as
updates to certain macroeconomic variables, and

• a net addition of $23 million in consumer ,
consisting of $153 million in Card Services,
predominantly offset by a $146 million net reduction
in Home Lending.

There was also a $58 million net reduction in the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit
and Investment Risk Management on pages 10-12 and

Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of:

• higher balances in CIB, driven by net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Payments and
Securities Services,

• an increase in CCB due to new accounts and seasonal
inflows, largely offset by a decline in deposits in
existing accounts due to migration into higher-
yielding investments,

• a decrease in AWM due to continued migration into
higher-yielding investments, partially offset by an
increase in deposits in existing accounts due to a
change in product offerings associated with First
Republic, and

• a decrease in CB primarily due to seasonal outflows
and continued deposit attrition, largely offset by the
realignment of additional clients associated with
First Republic from CCB to CB that began in the fourth
quarter of 2023.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased driven by
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher secured financing of trading
assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end.

additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under

funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements; Business Segment Results on

Trading liabilities increased due to higher levels of
short positions in debt instruments in Fixed Income
Markets, reflecting client-driven market-making
activities, and when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
predominantly due to higher client payables related to
client-driven activities in Markets.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by:

• higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller
conduit commercial paper held by third parties in CIB,
reflecting changes in the Firm’s short-term liquidity
management, and

• the issuance of credit card securitizations in
Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 44-51 and
Notes 13 and 22 for add itional information,
specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased driven by issuances in

Operating activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and higher accrued interest and
accounts receivable, partially offset by higher trading liabilities, accounts payable and other liabilities, and
lower other assets. • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable and other
liabilities, partially offset by lower other assets and accrued interest and accounts receivable. Investing
activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset
by proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. • In 2023, cash provided primarily
reflected net proceeds from investment securities.

Financing activities • In 2024, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, higher deposits, net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of
preferred stock. • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements
and deposits, partially offset by net payments on long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was
used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 83-87.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax expense. These
adjustments have no impact on net income as reported
by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs;

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis.

As a result of the organizational changes announced on
January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its
business segments to reflect the manner in which the
segments will be managed. The reorganization of the
business segments will be effective in the second
quarter of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page 52 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for
a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide
various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments or businesses within each
segment join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating
businesses may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other
segments/businesses involved in the transaction. The
segment and business results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.
Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized
in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic
conditions and other factors, which may impact the
allocation of net interest income to the segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 71-76 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to
Line of business equity on page 41, and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–85
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Primarily includes operating lease income and commissions and other fees. Operating lease income was $665
million and $741 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (b) Included
depreciation expense on leased assets of $427 million and $407 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $(1) million and $(12) million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (d) Includes First Republic. Refer to page 20 for additional
information. (e) Banking & Wealth Management and Home Lending included revenue associated with First Republic of
$639 million and $392 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Quarterly results Net income was $4.8 billion, down 8%. Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 7%. Net interest income
was $13.7 billion, up 7%, driven by: • higher Card Services NII, reflecting an increase in revolving balances, and
• the impact of First Republic in Home Lending, partially offset by • deposit margin compression, reflecting higher
rates paid and lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"). Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion,
up 9%, driven by: • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, strong net inflows and
the impact of First Republic, as well as other service fees associated with First Republic, and higher commissions
from annuity sales in BWM, and • higher production revenue in Home Lending, which included the impact of First
Republic, partially offset by • lower auto operating lease income, and • lower card income driven by an increase in
new account origination costs, largely offset by higher annual fees, reflecting continued growth in the portfolio.
Net interchange income was relatively flat as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was offset
by higher reward costs and partner payments. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income, asset
management fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 78-80 for credit card
rewards liability. Noninterest expense was $9.3 billion, up 15%, reflecting: • higher compensation expense,
predominantly driven by an increase in employees, including the impact of First Republic and in technology, as well
as higher revenue-related compensation, primarily for bankers and advisors, and • higher noncompensation expense,
largely driven by the impact of First Republic and investments in marketing and technology. Refer to Business
Segment Results on page 20 and Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The provision
for credit losses was $1.9 billion, reflecting: • net charge-offs of $1.9 billion, up $827 million, including $766
million in Card Services, reflecting continued portfolio normalization, and $50 million in Auto, driven by a
decline in used vehicle valuations, and
                                                        21                                                         
• a $34 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of: – $153 million in Card Services,
primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages, largely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, and – a $125 million
net reduction in Home Lending, primarily due to improvements in the outlook for home prices. The provision in the
prior year was $1.4 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a $350 million net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, predominantly in Card Services. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 52-70 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67-69 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and
the allowance for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2024 and 2023, nonaccrual loans
excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and
insured by U.S. government agencies of $107 million
and $164 million, respectively. These amounts have
been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual
status as permitted by regulatory guidance. (b) At
March 31, 2024 and 2023, excluded mortgage loans
insured by U.S. government agencies of $147 million
and $219 million, respectively, that are 30 or more
days past due. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee. (c) Includes First
Republic. (d) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted
changes to the TDR accounting guidance. The adoption
of this guidance resulted in a net decrease in the
allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by
residential real estate and credit card. Refer to Note

banking products sold to CB clients through the CIB
that is subject to a revenue sharing arrangement which
is reported as a reduction in All other income. (b)

alternative energy investments and affordable housing
projects; and income from tax-exempt securities of

adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives, other valuation
adjustments, and certain components of fair value
option elected liabilities, which are primarily
reported in principal transactions revenue. Results
are presented net of associated hedging activities and
net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 19
for additional information. Quarterly results Net
income was $4.8 billion, up 8%. Net revenue was $13.6
billion, relatively flat when compared to the prior
year. Banking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 6%. •
Investment Banking revenue was $2.0 billion, up 27%,
predominantly driven by higher Investment Banking
fees, up 21%, reflecting higher debt and equity
underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory
fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking
fees, according to Dealogic. – D ebt underwriting fees
were $1.0 billion, up 58%, predominantly driven by
higher industry-wide issuance in leveraged loans and
high-yield bonds, as well as higher issuance in high
grade bonds reflecting wallet share gains. – Equity
underwriting fees were $355 million, up 51%, driven by
IPO and convertible securities offerings, reflecting
wallet share gains. – Advisory fees were $598 million,
down 21%, driven by a lower number of large completed
transactions. • Payments revenue was $2.4 billion,
down 1%. Excluding the net impact of equity
investments, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit
margin compression reflecting higher rates paid and
higher deposit-related client credits, largely offset
by fee growth and higher average deposits. • Lending
revenue was $130 million, down 51%, and included $264
million of fair value losses on credit protection
purchased against certain retained loans and lending-
related commitments.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.2 billion, down 2%. Markets revenue was $8.0 billion, down 5%. • Fixed
Income Markets revenue was $5.3 billion, down 7%, driven by lower revenues in Rates and Commodities compared with a
strong prior year, partially offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products. • Equity Markets revenue was $2.7
billion, relatively flat compared to the prior year. • Securities Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 3%, driven
by higher market levels and average deposits. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $15 million, compared with
a loss of $153 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, down 4%, predominantly driven by
lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $32 million, reflecting a $30 million net addition to the
allowance for credit losses. The provision in the prior year was $58 million, predominantly driven by net charge-
offs. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 52-70 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67-69
for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $126 million and $153
million were held against these nonaccrual loans at
March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (b) At March
31, 2024 and 2023, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage
loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S.
government agencies of $50 million and $99 million,
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee. (c) Loans held-for-sale
and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating
the net charge-off/(recovery) rate. (d) Management
uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-
GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that

are reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 75 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

(a) Includes CB’s share of revenue from Investment
Banking and Markets' products sold to CB clients
through the CIB which is reported in All other income.
(b) Includes gross revenues earned by the Firm that
are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement between
CB and the CIB for Investment Banking and Markets'
products sold to CB clients. This includes revenues
related to fixed income and equity markets products.
Refer to Business Segment Results on page 18 for a
discussion of revenue sharing. (c) Includes First
Republic. Refer to page 20 for additional information.
(d) Middle Market Banking and Commercial Real Estate
Banking included $72 million and $278 million,
respectively, for the three months ended March 31,
2024, associated with First Republic. Quarterly
results Net income was $1.9 billion, up 39%. Net
revenue was $4.0 billion, up 13%. Net interest income
was $3.0 billion, up 11%, predominantly driven by
First Republic reflecting higher average loans and the
accretion of the purchase discount, partially offset
by deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates
paid . Noninterest revenue was $925 million, up 18%,
driven by: • higher lending-related revenue as a
result of the amortization of the purchase discount on
certain acquired lending-related commitments
associated with First Republic, • higher deposit-
related fees, partially offset by the higher level of
client credits that reduce such fees, and • higher
card income and investment banking revenue.
Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, up 15%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense,
reflecting an increase in employees including front
office and technology.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $31 million, reflecting: • a $98 million net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses which included an addition to the allowance for credit losses associated with net
downgrade activity, primarily in Commercial Real Estate, which was more than offset by updates to certain
macroeconomic variables and the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, and • net
charge-offs of $67 million. The provision in the prior year was $417 million, reflecting a net addition to the
allowance for credit losses. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 52-70 and Allowance for Credit
Losses on pages 67-69 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.3 billion, down 6%. Net revenue was $5.1 billion, up 7%. Net interest income
was $1.6 billion, up 10%. Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3
billion, down 4%. Excluding the gain of $339 million on CIFM in the prior year, revenue was up 11%, driven by: •
higher asset management fees reflecting strong net inflows and higher average market levels. Revenue from Global
Private Bank was $2.8 billion, up 18%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue, largely driven by higher management
fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, and the amortization of the purchase discount on
certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, and • higher net interest income,
driven by higher average deposits and loans associated with First Republic, and from wider spreads on loans,
largely offset by deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates paid. The prior year included an investment
valuation loss. Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, up 12%, largely driven by: • higher compensation including: –
revenue-related compensation, continued growth in private banking advisor teams, and – the impact of First
Republic, and the acquisition of J.P. Morgan Asset Management China (formerly CIFM), as well as • higher
distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $57 million, reflecting a net reduction in
the allowance for credit losses . The provision in the prior year was $28 million, reflecting a net addition to the
allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on lending related fees. Refer to Credit
and Investment Risk Management on pages 52-70 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67-69 for further
discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results Net income was $676 million, compared with $244 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $2.2
billion, up 124%. Net interest income was $2.5 billion, up 42%, due to the impact of balance sheet mix and higher
rates. Noninterest revenue was a loss of $275 million, driven by lower net investment securities losses on sales of
U.S. GSE, government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolio. Noninterest expense of $1.3 billion was up $1.1 billion driven by: • the $725 million increase to the
FDIC special assessment, and • the impact from First Republic, largely integration and restructuring costs. Refer
to Business Segment Results on page 20 for additional information on First Republic and Note 5 for additional
information on the FDIC special assessment. The provision for credit losses was $27 million. The provision in the
prior year was $370 million, reflecting an addition to the allowance for credit losses, including an addition
associated with certain Other assets. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the investment securities
portfolio, and Note 12 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses. Other Corporate also reflects
the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6
Bank.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 86–89 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an
insufficient level or composition of capital to
support the Firm’s business activities and associated
risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks
is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.
Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and
an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).

For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the
capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches
compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements.

In July 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and the FDIC
released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule:
Amendments applicable to large banking organizations
and to banking organizations with significant trading
activity", which is referred to in this Form 10-Q as
the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under the proposal,
changes to the framework would include replacement of
the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based
approach, which would not permit the use of internal
models for the calculation of RWA, other than for
market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer
requirement would be applicable to both the expanded
risk-based approach and the Standardized approach. The
proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital
requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion
or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global
systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed
effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-
based approach.

Under the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal,
the new expanded risk-based approach, when fully
phased-in, would be the Firm's binding constraint. The
Firm is managing its CET1 capital in anticipation of
the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal.

Refer to page 92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for additional information on the U.S. Basel III
proposal.

As of March 31, 2024, the Advanced Total Capital ratio
is the most binding constraint of the Firm's Basel III
risk-based ratios. However, as of March 31, 2024, with
respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the
Standardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate its SLR.

Refer to page 41 of this Form 10-Q and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on SLR.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part of
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax
was imposed on net share repurchases effective January
1, 2023. The Board of Directors’ authorization to
repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase
program approved by the Board does not establish
specific price targets or timetables. Management
determines the amount and timing of common share
repurchases based on various factors, including market
conditions; legal and regulatory considerations
affecting the amount and timing of repurchase
activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital
generation; current and proposed future capital
requirements; and other investment opportunities. The
amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases in
any period may be substantially more or less than the
amounts estimated or actually repurchased in prior
periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the
decision-making process. Refer to Capital actions on
page 99 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information. Refer to Part II, Item 2:

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to
support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages
102–109 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the
Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk. LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total
net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day
period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the
amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum
LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-
bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s
reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum
of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three
months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and
March 31, 2023 based on the Firm’s interpretation of
the LCR framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities
may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are
included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased compared with the three
months ended March 31, 2023, predominantly driven by the impact of First Republic, primarily due to the increase in
loans, largely offset by the addition of the Purchase Money Note and Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances.
Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and
estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve
actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR
Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm
conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities
have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s
resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are
performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at
the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to
comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress
when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.
                                                        44                                                         
                                                                                                                   
   Liquidity sources                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $673
billion and $649 billion as of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The increase compared to December 31,
2023, was driven by an increase in CIB trading assets,
largely offset by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm
had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of
available cash and securities, respectively, comprised
of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact
of regulatory haircuts of approximately $823 billion
and $798 billion, respectively, and unencumbered
marketable securities with a fair value of
approximately $673 billion and $649 billion,
respectively.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
FHLB and the discount window at the Federal Reserve
Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to
such banks of approximately $352 billion and $340
billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and other central banks. Available
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2023
primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing
capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window
and the other central banks as a primary source of
liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with
the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's
interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's
U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023
and September 30, 2023 on the Firm’s website for
additional information.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term

debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-
bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
which are primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

  Firm                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be
impacted.

Average deposits were higher for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2023, reflecting the net impact of:

• growth in CIB due to net issuances of structured
notes as a result of client demand, and net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Payments and
Securities Services, partially offset by deposit
attrition, including actions taken to reduce certain
deposits,

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives,

• growth in AWM from new and existing customers as a
result of new product offerings and the impact of
First Republic, predominantly offset by continued
migration into higher-yielding investments driven by
the higher interest rate environment,

• a decrease in CCB reflecting a decline in deposits
in existing accounts due to migration into higher-
yielding investments and increased customer spending,
largely offset by the impact of First Republic, and

• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition,
offset by the retention of inflows associated with
disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023
and the impact of First Republic.

Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2023,
reflecting the net impact of:

• higher balances in CIB, driven by net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Payments and
Securities Services,

• an increase in CCB due to new accounts and seasonal
inflows, largely offset by a decline in deposits in
existing accounts due to migration into higher-
yielding investments,

• a decrease in AWM due to continued migration into
higher-yielding investments, partially offset by an
increase in deposits in existing accounts due to a
change in product offerings associated with First
Republic, and
                                                        46                                                         
• a decrease in CB primarily due to seasonal outflows
and continued deposit attrition, largely offset by the
realignment of additional clients associated with
First Republic from CCB to CB that began in the fourth
quarter of 2023. Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated
Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment
Results on pages 13-14 and pages 18-36, respectively,
for further information on deposit and liability
balance trends, as well as Note 26 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition. Refer
to Note 3 for further information on structured notes.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection
that provides additional funding stability and results
in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection
may be available to depositors in the countries in
which the deposits are placed. R efer to pages 105–106
of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on the Firm's total uninsured deposits.
The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.
and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining
maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S.
time deposits are based on data that the Firm
calculates periodically under applicable FDIC
regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all
non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2024,
compared with December 31, 2023, driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher secured financing of trading
assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in period-end commercial paper for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 from December 31,
2023 was due to lower issuance levels primarily
reflecting short-term liquidity management.
                                                        49                                                         
Long-term funding Long-term funding provides an
additional source of stable funding and liquidity for
the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven
primarily by expected client activity, liquidity
considerations and regulatory requirements, including
TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining
diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan. Unsecured funding and
issuance The significant majority of the Firm’s total
outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the
Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of
the funding needs of both bank and non-bank
subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to
external counterparties. For the three months ended
March 31, 2024, the increase in average structured
notes compared to the prior year period was
attributable to net issuances of structured notes in
Markets due to client demand. The following table
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31,
2024 and 2023. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 102–109 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and
long-term debt.

The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note
4 and Note 13 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2024, were as follows:

(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

(f) Includes billed interest and fees.

insured by U.S. government agencies of $157 million and $182 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $15.1 billion and $11.0 billion for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-
off/(recovery) rates.

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,
2023 driven by retained residential real estate loans.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage
loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
decreased compared to December 31, 2023, predominantly
driven by paydowns and loans sales, net of
originations. Net recoveries were lower for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior
year. Loans held-for-sale increased from December 31,
2023, predominantly driven by a transfer of certain
retained loans in anticipation of securitization. At
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was
$90.3 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of
this portfolio is comparable with the performance of
the broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying
value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$15.3 billion at March 31, 2024, which included $2.4
billion associated with First Republic. The carrying
value of home equity lines of credit outstanding
included $4.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast from
interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $4.1 billion of interest-only
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The
Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the
extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting
a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

real estate loans. Modified residential real estate
loans For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and
2023, residential real estate financial difficulty
modifications ("FDMs") were $39 million and $38
million, respectively. Loans subject to trial
modification where the terms of the loans have not
been permanently modified, and loans subject to
discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings
("Chapter 7 loans"), were not material for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 1

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, generally consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
portfolio decreased when compared to December 31,
2023, predominantly due to a loan securitization. Net
charge-offs increased for the three months ended March
31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year
due to higher scored auto net charge-offs of $50
million reflecting a decline in used vehicle
valuations, largely offset by lower overdraft charge-
offs. Refer to Note 13 for further information on
securitization activity. Nonperforming assets The
following table presents information as of March 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, about consumer, excluding

Total credit card loans decreased from December 31,
2023 reflecting the impact of seasonality. The March
31, 2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.23%
and 1.16%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of
2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, due to credit
normalization and as newer vintages season. Net
charge-offs increased for the three months ended March
31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year
due to higher delinquencies.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,
credit card FDMs were $259 million and $163 million,
respectively. FDMs increased for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in
the prior year due to higher delinquencies, reflecting
growth in the portfolio. Loans subject to trial
modification where the terms of the loans have not
been permanently modified were not material for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 60-63 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain
operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting
classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to
Business Developments on page 9 for additional information. As of March 31, 2024, retained loans decreased by $4.7
billion and lending-related commitments decreased by $4.3 billion. As of March 31, 2024, nonperforming exposure
increased by $702 million predominantly driven by Real Estate loans concentrated in Office, and Individuals,
resulting from downgrades. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, wholesale net charge-offs were $86 million,
largely in Real Estate, concentrated in Office.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2024,
may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

  Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized
exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $45.8 billion and $41.4 billion as of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, representing approximately 3.6% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of
the $45.8 billion, $42.2 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate
concentrated in Office, reflecting downgrades, and held-for-sale commitments in Technology and Consumer & Retail.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Since March 31, 2023,
nonaccrual loan exposure increased by $966 million
driven by retained loans in Real Estate concentrated
in Office and in Healthcare, reflecting downgrades,
and in Individuals, predominantly driven by the impact
of First Republic, partially offset by a client-
specific upgrade in civic organizations.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on
deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable
debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors
the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and
the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s
obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair
value of the collateral declines. Because of these
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses
based on the value of the collateral and probability
of borrower default. These receivables are reported
within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K

  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the

derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, the
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP.
Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts
through the use of legally enforceable master netting
arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage
of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to
collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange
spot trades, which are not typically covered by
collateral agreements due to their short maturity and
centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 87% at both March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023. Refer to Note 4 for additional information
on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a
further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $56.6 billion and
$54.9 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The increase was primarily as a result
of market movements. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and
other cash collateral that may be used as security
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the
Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of
liquid securities is consistent with the definition of
high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
receivables balances and is not included in the tables
below, it is available as security against potential
exposure that could arise should the fair value of the
client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s
favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on
the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative
transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's
allowance for credit losses generally consists of : •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and
is presented separately on the Consolidated balance
sheets, • the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable
and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on
investment securities, which is reflected in
investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The
allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2024 was
relatively flat when compared to December 31, 2023,
reflecting: • a net reduction of $142 million in
wholesale , which included a net addition associated
with net downgrade activity, largely in Real Estate,
primarily in CB, which was more than offset by the net
impact of changes in the loan and lending-related
commitment portfolios, as well as updates to certain
macroeconomic variables, and • a net addition of $44
million in consumer , consisting of: – $153 million in
Card Services, primarily due to seasoning of newer
vintages, largely offset by reduced borrower
uncertainty, predominantly offset by: – a $125 million
net reduction in Home Lending, primarily driven by
improvements in the outlook for home prices. The Firm
has maintained the additional weight placed on the
adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023 to
reflect downside risks as a result of persistent
inflation and tightening financial conditions. The
Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using
a weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than
the central case assumptions provided in the table
below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.4% in the first quarter
of 2025, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level
that is 1.7% lower than the central case at the end of
the second quarter of 2025.

The following table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At March 31,
2024, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was
$568.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
35-36 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
44-51 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 71-76
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve based on market circumstances and in line with
its strategic initiatives, including the Firm’s
environmental and social goals. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as of March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
135–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
140–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR
for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(b) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans
and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include
the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model
governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio
VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were
also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Includes average AWM VaR of $9 million for the period ended March 31, 2024 associated with credit protection
purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal
transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.
Also includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 144 of the 258 days, and observed
eleven VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on
49 of the 64 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended March 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities which are included in VaR, but also from
the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which
include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the
investment securities portfolio, and associated
derivative instruments.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities,
long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges,
and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk
management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as
described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure
from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising
from the Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of
the hedges in these simulations would increase U.S.
dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar
sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign
exchange risk on page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for more information.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential
change to a net interest income baseline, over the
following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.
These scenarios include a parallel shift involving
changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an
equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding
short-term rates constant and increasing long-term
rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing
short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant
or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing
long-term rates. These scenarios consider many
different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and
require management judgment. Therefore, the actual
amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular
time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through
the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In
addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level
of loans across the industry and competition for
deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as
deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit
rates paid could change upon a given change in market
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to
customer behavior and competition for deposits.

The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts
of deposit balances, both of which are especially
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to
the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently
evaluating updates to deposit rates paid used in its
earnings-at-risk scenarios considering observed
pricing and client and customer behavior. In the
current environment, incorporating these updated
deposit rates paid would affect the U.S. dollar
scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios
expected to result in an increase in positive
sensitivity, and lower interest rate scenarios
expected to result in an increase in negative
sensitivity, with respect to the Firm’s earnings-at-
risk. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest
rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not
represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income
(Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional
information).

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates. The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities as of March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily reflected the impact of changes in the
Firm’s balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the Firm’s sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel shift in
rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities
repricing.

Economic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of
earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions
for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk
management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the
EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value disclosure. For example, certain assets and
liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in
the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed
on page 101 in Note 2 financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.

  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain
counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is
now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 144–145 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2024 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including
client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The Firm continues to
monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $350 million as of March 31, 2024, driven by cash placed
with the central bank. This amount excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of
Russia. See Note 24 on pages 167-168 for information concerning Russian litigation.

require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and
Allowance for credit losses on pages 67-69 and Note 12
of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.
HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the
Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the
loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed
as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk
rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio,
and the ongoing integration of products and systems,
the allowance for credit losses for the acquired
wholesale portfolio was measured based on other
facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk
characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As
such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity
analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for
predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was
measured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the
consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real
estate that has more commonly defined risk
characteristics including loan to value ratio and
credit score, and therefore is reflected in the
sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 26 for
additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 143 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher over the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 2.9% in the first quarter of 2025.
                                                        78                                                         
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of
March 31, 2024, reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario due to the weight
placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and
nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be
simply extrapolated for more severe changes in
macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future
changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31,
2024, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under
its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario.
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects
in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $800 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $3.2 billion for credit card loans ▪ An
increase of approximately $3.7 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the
Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable
and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2024.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including geopolitical tensions and hostilities;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyber attacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the FDIC. The Firm continues to
convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic
acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal
risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 26 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase
and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting
and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring
adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements,
and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an
agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first
evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and
derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it
has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method
and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that
the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional amortization method.
This method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to
the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns
with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including
that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was
adopted on January 1, 2024 under the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a
change to the classification and timing of the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative
energy tax-oriented investments. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was
previously recognized in other income is now being recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting
resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $ 161million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense and the
effective tax rate by approximately $ 450million and twopercentage points, respectively, for the three months ended
March 31, 2024, with no material impact to net income.
                                                        88                                                         
The guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other income
tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the proportional
amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant
modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's
relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Note 5 and Note 13 for additional information.

(a) At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 103.8billion and $
78.5billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        92                                                         
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real
estate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, were trading assets of $ 47million and $ 42million, respectively, and other assets of $
1.0billion and $ 984million, respectively.

(e) At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included $ 10.2billion of residential first-lien mortgages and $
6.0billion of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans
originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.4billion and $ 2.9billion,
respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-
parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 729million, nonagency securities of $ 8million and
non-trading loans of $ 862million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 12million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $
1.3billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 466million and non-trading loans of $ 729million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 783million including $ 580million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as
well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range
of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)
for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the
determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3
financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or
losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such
level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3
assets since December 31, 2023, for those items
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis on page 99 for further information
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Three months ended March 31, 2024
Level 3 assets were $ 24.7billion at March 31, 2024,
reflecting an increase of $ 1.1billion from December
31, 2023. The increase for the three months ended
March 31, 2024 was driven by: • $ 1.1billion increase
in gross derivative receivables due to gains and
purchases largely offset by settlements. Refer to the
sections below for additional information. Transfers
between levels for instruments carried at fair value
on a recurring basis For the three months ended March
31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 there were no significant
transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the three
months ended March 31, 2024, there were no significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the three
months ended March 31, 2023, significant transfers
from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $
953million of gross equity derivative receivables as a
result of an increase in observability and a decrease
in the significance of unobservable inputs. All
transfers are based on changes in the observability
and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are
assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly
reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of
total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for
instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value

measurements rollforward tables on pages 95-98 for
further information on these instruments. Three months
ended March 31, 2024 • $ 799million of net losses on
assets, predominantly driven by losses in net equity
derivative receivables due to market movements. • $

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives
The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality
on the inception value of liabilities as well as the
impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality
over time.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures certain equity securities without
readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an
identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in
other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust
the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include
adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are
consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest
in approximately 37.2million Visa B-1 shares which is
held in the Firm's principal investment portfolio.
These shares are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A
common stock (“Visa A shares”) at a specified
conversion rate upon final resolution of certain
litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate
of Visa B-1 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875at March
31, 2024 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters. The
outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect
that the resolution of those matters may have on the
conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of March
31, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding
when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-1 shares may
be terminated and what the final conversion rate for
the Visa B-1 shares will be. As a result of these
considerations, as well as differences in voting
rights, Visa B-1 shares are not considered to be
similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held
at their nominal carrying value. On January 24, 2024,
Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC
announcing that Visa’s stockholders had approved
amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that
redenominated the Visa Class B common stock to Visa
Class B-1 common stock (“Visa B-1 shares”) and
authorized Visa to conduct one or more exchange
offers. On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial
exchange offer expiring May 3, 2024 for any and all
outstanding shares of Visa B-1 shares. Holders
participating in the exchange offer would receive a
combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (“Visa B-2
shares”) and Visa Class C common stock (“Visa C
shares”) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that are
validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa.
The Firm has tendered its 37.2million Visa B-1 shares,
and that

tender is pending Visa’s acceptance. In exchange for
each Visa B-1 share that is validly tendered and
accepted for exchange by Visa, the Firm would receive
one half of a newly issued share of Visa Class B-2
common stock (“Visa B-2 shares”) and newly issued Visa
C shares in an amount equivalent to one half of a Visa
B-1 share. Upon acceptance by Visa of the Firm’s
tender, the Visa C shares received by the Firm would
be recognized at fair value, which is expected to
result in a gain that may be recorded as early as the
second quarter of 2024. The Visa B-2 shares would
continue to be held at their nominal carrying value
and would continue to be subject to transfer
restrictions. The Firm would be entitled to sell the
Visa C shares received after a brief lock-up period
expires. Visa is also authorized to extend offers for
potential future exchanges, each enabling the release
of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are
met. The timing of future exchange offers is dependent
upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may
be outside of the Firm’s control. In connection with
prior sales of Visa B shares prior to the
redenomination to Visa B-1 shares, the Firm has
entered into derivative instruments with the
purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains
the risk associated with changes in the conversion
rate. Refer to page 194 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for further information.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

other unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $ 935million and $ 1.1billion, respectively, recorded in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Notes 22 and 26 for additional
information.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 177 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and
loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair
value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in
the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material both for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.
(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.
(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 11.4billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $
93million and $ 97million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
115 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        107                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 47.6billion and $ 48.3billion at March 31, 2024

related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income
statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 2.6billion and $ 5.6billion at March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 15.9billion and $ 19.3billion,
respectively. For both periods, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt is zero.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 69.3billion and $ 83.9billion,
of which $ 59.0billion and $ 68.0billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is
the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and
forward starting layers. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(
1.5) billion and $( 165) million, which is comprised of $( 1.2) billion and $ 73million for active hedging
relationships, and $( 304) million and $( 238) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer
to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item
in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31,
2024 and 2023.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.8) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at March 31, 2024, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in
fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. There were
nosales or liquidations of legal entities that resulted in reclassifications for the three month period ended March
31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm reclassified a pre-tax loss of $( 41) million to
other revenue related to the acquisition of CIFM. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage
commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and
losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s
wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against
certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit
derivatives and credit-related notes.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.
The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed
portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities,
however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the table for the types of securities being hedged.
Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 479million and $ 3.6billion of HTM securities for the three months ended March 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively.
(c) Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which
permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and
municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net pre-tax
unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. Refer to Note 19 of this Form 10-Q and Note 1
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information.
(d) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 154million and
$ 128million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
(e) Excludes $ 3.4billion and $ 2.8billion of accrued interest receivable at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of
accounting policies for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 5.0billion and $ 4.6billion, at March 31, 2024 and

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, all HTM securities were rated investment grade
and were current and accruing, with approximately 99%
rated at least AA+.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities was $ 154million and $ 90million as of
March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included
a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for
the period ended March 31, 2023. Refer to Note 10 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion
of accounting policies for AFS and HTM securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $ 34million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.2) billion at March
31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $
120million at March 31, 2024.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS and six yearsfor both agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm held $ 443million and $ 505million of financial assets for which
the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred
assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-
term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB.
(b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to SPEs, financial institutions, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and
individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within
CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2024,
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at March
31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 43million and $ 45million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2024.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of residential real estate loans to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that
generally provide various modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not
limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions,
other-than-insignificant payment deferral and
principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been
required under the terms of the original agreement,
are considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information.
Financial effects of FDMs For the three months ended
March 31, 2024, residential real estate FDMs were $
39million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which
were predominantly in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans by 16years and
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest
rate from 7.39% to 4.28%. For the three months ended
March 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $
38million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which
were largely in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans up to 24years, and
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest
rate from 5.84% to 3.57%. As of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, there were noadditional commitments
to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty
whose loans have been modified as FDMs. For the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, loans subject to
a trial modification and Chapter 7 loans were not
material.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for
60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and
will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further

weighted-average contractual interest by 100bps and providing payment deferrals with delayed amounts primarily
recaptured at maturity. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Secured by real estate FDMs were notmaterial.

when compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting: • a net reduction of $ 142million in wholesale , which included a
net addition associated with net downgrade activity, largely in Real Estate, primarily in CB, which was more than
offset by the net impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, as well as updates to
certain macroeconomic variables, and • a net addition of $ 44million in consumer , consisting of: – $ 153million in
Card Services, primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages, largely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty,
predominantly offset by: – a $ 125million net reduction in Home Lending, primarily driven by improvements in the
outlook for home prices. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first
quarter of 2023 to reflect downside risks as a result of persistent inflation and tightening financial conditions.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central
case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at
5.4% in the first quarter of 2025, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.7% lower than the central
case at the end of the second quarter of 2025.

assumptions for the periods presented:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        144                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests. Refer to page 150 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies
and liquidation losses.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial
paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 4.6billion and $ 9.8billion of the
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs
and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued
by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 11.2billion and $ 10.8billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to
extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their
municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer
TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the
Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial
interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests
in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.4billion and $ 3.1billion at March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These
include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement
agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual
credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the
underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,
the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated
balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party
transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does
not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,
represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 33.1billion and $ 35.1billion at March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023, of which $ 14.3billion and $ 14.7billion was unfunded at March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of
its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information
on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance which
expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond
                                                        147                                                        
affordable housing tax credit investments, that the
Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be
accounted for using the proportional amortization
method. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The
proportional amortization method requires the cost of
eligible investments, within an elected program, be
amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received
with the resulting amortization reported directly in
income tax expense, which aligns with the associated
tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must
meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that
substantially all of the return is from income tax
credits and other income tax benefits. In addition,
under this method deferred taxes are generally not
recorded as the investment is now amortized in
proportion to the income tax credits and other income
tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions
that are unconditional and legally binding or
conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in
other liabilities with a corresponding increase in the
carrying value of the investment. The guidance also
requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when
significant modifications or events occur that result
in a change in the nature of the investment or a
change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying
project. During the period, there were no significant
modifications or events that resulted in a change in
the nature of an eligible investment or a change in
the Firm's relationship with the underlying project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected to
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $ 5.2billion
and $ 5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at both March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023 was $ 7.3billion.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions
pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,
the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for
the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement
of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these
loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of
loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the
purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to
material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to
repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real

Note 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and
other intangible assets

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the accounting policies related to
goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other
intangible assets. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon
completion of a business combination as the difference
between the purchase price and the fair value of the
net assets acquired, and can be adjusted up to one
year from the acquisition date as additional
information pertaining to facts and circumstances that
existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.
The following table presents goodwill attributed to
the reportable business segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be
an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill
impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in
capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s
reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a
future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2024, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of
business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31,

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and outlines the
sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined
below.

Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded
at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including
core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized
over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets
with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed
periodically for impairment. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other intangible assets consisted of
finite-lived intangible assets of $ 1.9billion and $ 2.0billion, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived
intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $ 1.2billion for both periods.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. The
Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as
a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal insured depository
institution ("IDI") subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital
requirements established by its primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were
subject as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January
1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit,
provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected
the remaining benefit of $ 720million and $
1.4billion, respectively, associated with the CECL
capital transition provisions. Similarly, as of
January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased out 75% of the
other CECL capital transition provisions which
impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. Refer
to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business
banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the
same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm
transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.
Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for further information on these derivatives.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase
demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding litigation.
                                                        164                                                        
Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment
networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the
Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,
retains a contingent liability for disputed processed
credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved
in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the
cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount
to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction
to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the
amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss
for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.
The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or
obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 163. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 163 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged
assets.

Total pledged assets do not include assets of
consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the
liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for
additional information on assets and liabilities of
consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on the Firm’s securities financing
activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s
long-term debt.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.
The following table presents the fair value of
collateral accepted.

Contingencies

As of March 31, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,
regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations
and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to
approximately $ 1.4billion at March 31, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was
based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate
of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can
be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves
significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that
many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the
Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of
the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the
uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions
concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties
or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular
proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the
likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably
possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are
descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)
SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the
validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by
1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a
new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and
the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In
addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions
arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons
for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010
and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects
developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential
units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,
and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the
offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the
inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions
                                                        166                                                        
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following
the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission
matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation
matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain
parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a
class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the
District Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on
similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In
July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for
class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative
class action, which remains subject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm
is responding to inquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to
transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to
requests for information. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of
class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of
credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018,
the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing
approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. Based on
the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from
the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the
District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In March
2024, Visa and Mastercard announced a settlement of the injunctive class action, agreeing to certain changes to
their respective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. This
settlement is subject to approval by the District Court. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class
settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-
branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorgan Chase
has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to
the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the
European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s
investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm
appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an
infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled
the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical
amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps
sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual
plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful
agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer l oans and
credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian
Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of
certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are
within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments
on transactions that the Firm cannot make under and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant
sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts
have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign
sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. As to claims against the Firm, a Russian court entered judgment
against the Firm in one claim in February 2024, which the Firm has
                                                        167                                                        
appealed in Russia. In separate claims, in April 2024, Russian courts ordered an interim freeze of assets in Russia
(including funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named
defendants) pending a determination on the underlying claims. Russian courts may rule similarly in other cases,
including ordering freezes of assets. The Firm challenged the April 2024 freeze orders in the Russian courts and in
a New York federal court action, and a Russian court has issued an order instructing the Firm to discontinue the
New York action. The value of the current claims and the orders to freeze assets against the Firm exceed the total
amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. If the claims are enforced despite the actions taken by
the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia
could be seized in full or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries . The
Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio
managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm’s
liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private
funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation .
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic
Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York
State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading
for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved,
and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as
well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm,
its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to
historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related
conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and
fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC
in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above.
In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the
plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting state claims of breaches of
fiduciary duty and federal claims of violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the
Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements
which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. In March
2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over
the remaining state claims. Trading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries
regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade
surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not
feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and
data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not
originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or
the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on
one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to
maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. In March
2024, the Firm entered into resolutions with the OCC and the Board of Governors of the FRB that require the Firm
to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil
penalties of approximately $ 350million. The Firm also expects to enter into a resolution with a third U.S.
regulator that will require the Firm to, among other things, pay a civil penalty of $ 100million after offsets for
amounts paid to the OCC and FRB. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these
resolutions. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings.
The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal
proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to
time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal
proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-
related liability when it is probable
                                                        168                                                        
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates
its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such
reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel.
The Firm’s legal expense was $( 72) million and $ 176million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants
seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number
of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual
outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,
penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and
after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking
into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other
legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated
financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings,
there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome
of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on,
among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that
period.

  Note 25 – Business segments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. As a result of the organizational changes
announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the manner in which
the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments will be effective in the second quarter
of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page 52 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. Refer to
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment
results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three months ended
March 31, 2024 and 2023, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At
least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information on capital allocation.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver.
The Firm believes that the First Republic acquisition
is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises.
The acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain
purchase gain, which represents the excess of the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above
the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this
acquisition constitutes a business combination under
U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally
measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1,
2023. The determination of those fair values required
management to make certain market-based assumptions
about expected future cash flows, discount rates and
other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition.
The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a
reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain
purchase gain. The First Republic acquisition resulted
in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $
2.7billion. Adjustments to the purchase price and the
estimated bargain purchase gain may take place up to
one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by
U.S. GAAP. The Firm is working to conclude the final
settlement process with the FDIC. Resolution of
certain matters relating to the final settlement will
occur after May 1, 2024. The current estimated bargain
purchase gain of $ 2.8billion reflects measurement
period adjustments made to the fair value of the net
assets acquired, from the acquisition date through
March 31, 2024, including a reduction of $ 16million
for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Refer to
Note 34 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further
information on the First Republic acquisition.

The computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as
part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below, and
reflects adjustments made through March 31, 2024 to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information

Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net
income contributed by First Republic of $ 315million, $ 1.3billion and $ 668million, respectively, for the three
months ended March 31, 2024.
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31,
2023 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated
bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2billion. Additional adjustments
include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair
value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the
results of operations in future periods.

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2024, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and
2023, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information
set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet information as of December 31, 2023, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

the appraised value of the collateral (i.e.,
residential real estate) securing the loan.
                                                                                                                   
  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest
                                                        178                                                        
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast,
which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance
and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and

interest has been in default for a period of 90 days
or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in
the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans
are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual
fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star
rating is the best rating and represents the top 10%
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star
rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average
of the performance associated with a fund’s three-,
five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star
ratings are provided at the individual share class
level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than
three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the
                                                        183                                                        
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable
fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund
rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S.
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except
for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the
fund level. The performance data may have been
different if all share classes had been included. Past
performance is not indicative of future results.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd
quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset
values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based
on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong
Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all
share classes had been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
