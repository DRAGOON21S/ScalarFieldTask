First Republic : JPMorgan Chase acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of First
Republic Bank from the FDIC on May 1, 2023. As a
result, the current-quarter and year-to-date results
include the three- and six-month impact of First
Republic, respectively, compared with two months in
the prior-year periods. Where meaningful to the
results, this is referred to in this Form 10-Q as the
"timing impact" of First Republic.

Visa shares : On April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. commenced an
initial exchange offer for Visa Class B-1 common
shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa
had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million
Visa Class B-1 common shares in exchange for a
combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa
Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in
a $7.9 billion net gain for the period ended June 30,
2024.

In addition, the Firm contributed $1.0 billion of Visa
shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation. Refer to
Principal Investment Risk and Market Risk Management
on page 78 and pages 79-84, respectively, and Notes 2
and 5 for additional information.

  Firmwide overview                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
For the second quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase
reported net income of $18.1 billion, up 25%, earnings
per share of $6.12, ROE of 23% and ROTCE of 28%. The
Firm's results included the following in Corporate: a
$7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares, a $1.0
billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan
Chase Foundation, and $546 million of net investment
securities losses.
                                                         5                                                         
• Total net revenue was $50.2 billion, up 22%,
reflecting:

– Net interest income ("NII") of $22.7 billion, up 4%,
driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher
rates; higher revolving balances in Card Services; the
timing impact of First Republic; and higher Markets
net interest income, largely offset by deposit margin
compression across the LOBs and lower average deposit
balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $22.9
billion, up 3%.

– Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $27.5 billion, up
41%, driven by the $7.9 billion net gain related to
Visa shares, higher investment banking fees, higher
asset management fees, lower net investment securities
losses in Treasury and CIO, and higher Markets
noninterest revenue. The prior year included the
preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7
billion associated with First Republic.

• Noninterest expense was $23.7 billion, up 14%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense,
including higher revenue-related compensation and
growth in employees, as well as the $1.0 billion
contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase
Foundation.

• The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion,
reflecting $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $821
million. Net charge-offs increased by $820 million,
predominantly driven by the seasoning of newer
vintages and continued credit normalization in Card
Services. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses included $609 million in consumer , primarily
in Card Services, and $189 million in wholesale .

The provision in the prior year was $2.9 billion,
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, including $1.2 billion to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments, and $1.4 billion of
net charge-offs.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $25.5
billion at June 30, 2024. The Firm had an allowance
for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of
1.81%, compared with 1.75% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.4 billion
at June 30, 2024, up 7%, driven by wholesale
nonaccrual loans, which reflect downgrades in Real
Estate, concentrated in Office, partially offset by
net sales of consumer nonaccrual loans. Refer to
Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 65-74 and pages 61-64,
respectively, for additional information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 6%,
predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CIB,
including the timing impact of First Republic.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down
1%, reflecting:

– a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due
to increased customer spending,

predominantly offset by

– net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result
of client demand in Markets, and net inflows in
Payments,

– the timing impact of First Republic, and

– an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

• CET1 capital was $267 billion, and the Standardized
and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.3% and 15.5%,
respectively.

• SLR was 6.1%.

• TBVPS grew 16%, ending the second quarter of 2024 at
$92.77.

• As of June 30, 2024, the Firm had eligible end-of-
period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of
approximately $841 billion and unencumbered marketable
securities with a fair value of approximately $623
billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management

Investment banking fees in creased in CIB reflecting:

• higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven
by higher industry-wide issuance in leveraged loans,
high-yield bonds and high-grade bonds,

• higher equity underwriting fees driven by follow-on
offerings, IPOs and private placements, reflecting
wallet share gains amid favorable market conditions,
and

• higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of
large completed transactions compared with a
challenging prior-year quarter.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-35 and Note 5
for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting
in CIB:

• lower Fixed Income Markets revenue in Rates,
Currencies and Emerging Markets, and Commodities,
partially offset by higher revenue in Securitized
Products,

• a loss of $87 million in Credit Adjustments & Other
in CIB, compared with a gain of $36 million in the
prior year, and

• higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and
Equity Derivatives.

The decrease in principal transactions revenue also
included lower revenue in Treasury and CIO.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has
offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of
its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages
28-35 and pages 41-43, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was flat as higher
other len ding- and deposit-related fees in CIB were
offset by lower amortization in the current quarter
associated with the purchase discount on certain
short-dated First Republic lending-related
commitments, predominantly in AWM. Refer to CCB, CIB
and AWM segment results on pages 23-27, pages 28-35
and pages 36-40, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Asset management fees increased driven by higher
average market levels and net inflows in AWM and CCB.
Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 23-27
and pages 36-40, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Commissions and other fees increased and included
higher brokerage commissions and fees in CIB and AWM,
and higher annuity sales commissions in CCB. Refer to
CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 23-27, pages
28-35 and pages 36-40, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Investment securities losses decreased related to
sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government
agency MBS, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. R
efer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-43 and
Note 9 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income increased in Home
Lending, predominantly reflecting higher production
revenue. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27
and Note 14 for additional information.

Card income increased in CCB, reflecting higher net
interchange on increased debit and credit card sales
volume, and higher annual fees, partially offset by an
increase in amortization of new account origination
costs, reflecting continued growth in Card Services .

The prior-year net interchange included an increase to
the rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms
of certain reward programs. Refer to CCB segment
results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional
information.

Other income incre ased, reflecting:

• in Corporate

– the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares;

– the prior year included the preliminary estimated
bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion associated with
the First Republic acquisition, and

• the impact of the adoption of updates to the
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
guidance on January 1, 2024, resulting in the
amortization of certain of the Firm's alternative
energy tax-oriented investments previously recognized
in other income now being recognized in income tax
expense.

Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information
on the adoption of updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance; Notes 2
and 5 for additional information on Visa shares and;
Note 26 for additional information on the First
Republic acquisition.

Net interest income increased, driven by the impact of
balance sheet mix and higher rates; higher revolving
balances in Card Services; the timing impact of First
Republic; and higher Markets net interest income,
largely offset by deposit margin compression across
the LOBs and lower average deposit balances in CCB.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5
trillion, up $166 billion, and the yield was 5.57%, up
56 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.62%, flat when compared
to the prior year. The net yield excluding Markets was
3.86%, up 3 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 192 for further
information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 18-19 for a further discussion of
net yield excluding Markets.

in CIB compared with losses of $117 million in the

The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the
original minority interest in China International Fund
Management ("CIFM") in AWM .

Refer to AWM segment results on pages 36-40 for
additional information on CIFM.

Net interest income increased driven by the impact of
balance sheet mix and higher rates; the timing impact
of First Republic; higher revolving balances in Card
Services; and higher Markets net interest income,
partially offset by deposit margin compression across
the LOBs and lower average deposit balances in CCB.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5
trillion, up $197 billion, and the yield was 5.56%, up
71 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE
basis, was 2.66%, an increase of 3 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 3.85%, up 3 bps.

Refer to Executive Overview on pages 5-8 for
additional information on the timing impact of First
Republic.

downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, largely
offset by the impact of changes in the loan and
lending-related commitment portfolios.

The provision in the prior year was $2.9 billion,

(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto operating lease assets. Refer to Note 16 for additional
information.

(b) Refer to Note 5 for additional information.

(c) Predominantly fraud losses in CCB associated with customer deposit accounts, credit and debit cards.

(d) Included a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information.

Compensation expense increased driven by:

• higher volume- and revenue-related compensation
across the LOBs,

• an increase in employees, primarily in front office
and technology, and

• the impact of First Republic, predominantly in CCB
and Corporate, as the prior-year expense related to
individuals associated with First Republic who were
not employees of the Firm until July 2023, was
recognized in other expense in Corporate,

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of :

• the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation in Corporate,

• higher investments in technology and marketing,
predominantly in CCB, and

• higher occupancy expense,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense, reflecting a decline in
Corporate, largely offset by an increase in CIB, and

• the alignment of expense to compensation expense, as
noted above, partially offset by the timing impact
associated with First Republic.

Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the
First Republic acquisition; Notes 2 and 5 for
additional information on Visa shares and other
expense.

JPMorgan Chase Foundation in Corporate,

• the $725 million increase to the FDIC special
assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024 in
Corporate,

• higher investments in technology and marketing,
predominantly in CCB,

partially offset by the alignment of expense to
compensation expense, as noted above, and

partially offset by

(a) Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of adopting updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit
Structures guidance, the amortization of certain of the Firm’s alternative energy tax-oriented investments is now
being recognized in income tax expense. Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information.

The effective tax rate increased driven by:

• the adoption of updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on
January 1, 2024, and

• changes in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, which
included the impact of the net gain on Visa shares and
the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase
Foundation.

The prior year included the impact of the income tax
expense associated with the First Republic acquisition
that was reflected in the preliminary estimated
bargain purchase gain, which resulted in a reduction
in the Firm's effective tax rate.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased driven by Markets activities in CIB and cash
deployment in Treasury and CIO.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher demand for securities to cover
short positions, as well as when compared with
seasonally lower levels at year-end.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed.

Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets,
reflecting lower client-driven activities,
predominantly offset by higher demand for securities
to cover short positions.

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of
equity and debt instruments in Markets related to
client-driven market-making activities, and compared
with seasonally lower levels at year-end; and to a
lesser extent, an increase in short-term cash
deployment in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to:

• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities,
reflecting net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries
and non-U.S. government debt securities, partially
offset by maturities and paydowns, and

• lower HTM securities primarily driven by maturities
and paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-43,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 78, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans were relatively flat, and included :

• a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan sales
outpaced originations, and

• higher loans in Card Services driven by growth in
new accounts and revolving balances.

The allowance for loan losses incre ased, reflecting a
net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $571
million, consisting of:

• $636 million in consumer , primarily in Card
Services, predominantly driven by the seasoning of
newer vintages, loan growth, and updates to certain
macroeconomic variables, and a $141 million net
reduction in Home Lending,

partially offset by

• a net reduction of $65 million in wholesale , driven
by

– a net reduction of $763 million, primarily due to
the impact of changes in the loan portfolio and
updates to certain macroeconomic variables,

predominantly offset by

– a net addition of $698 million, including net
downgrade activity and the impact of incorporating the
First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled
credit loss estimates.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased
predominantly driven by higher client activities in
Markets.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets : refer to
Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased predominantly as a result of
higher deferred tax assets and the fair value of the
Visa C shares. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information on Visa shares.

Deposits de creased, reflecting:

• a decline in CCB in existing accounts, primarily
driven by seasonal tax outflows and migration into
higher-yielding investments, largely offset by new
accounts,

predominantly offset by

• higher deposits in CIB due to net inflows in
Securities Services and Payments, partially offset by
net maturities of structured notes in Markets,

• higher deposits in Corporate predominantly driven by
new product offerings related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, and

• higher balances in AWM driven by new product
offerings, and an increase in deposits in existing
accounts due to a change in product offerings
associated with First Republic, predominantly offset
by continued migration into higher-yielding
investments.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased driven by
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher secured financing of trading
assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end.

Short-term borrowings increased driven by higher net
issuance of structured notes in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings;
Notes 2 and 15 for deposits and Note 10 for federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements; Note 26 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in
debt instruments, and compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due
to higher client activities in Payments and Markets.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by the issuance of credit card
securitizations in Treasury and CIO, and higher levels
of Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial
paper held by third parties in CIB, in line with the
Firm’s funding plans.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 and
Notes 13 and 22 for add itional information,
specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances of
structured notes in CIB due to client demand, and net
issuances of long-term debt in Treasury and CIO,
largely offset by lower FHLB advances. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58; and Note 26
for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income,
largely offset by the impact of capital actions,
including repurchases of common shares, common and
preferred stock dividend payments and net redemption
of preferred stock. Refer to Consolidated statements
of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 94, Capital
Actions on page 49, and Note 19 for a dditional

Operating activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and higher accrued interest and
accounts receivable, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and higher accounts payable and other
liabilities. • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable and other
liabilities, partially offset by lower other assets, securities borrowed, and accrued interest and accounts
receivable. Investing activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale
agreements and net purchases of investment securities. • In 2023, cash provided reflected net proceeds from
investment securities, largely offset by higher net originations of loans, higher securities purchased under resale
agreements, and net cash used in the First Republic acquisition.

Financing activities • In 2024, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements and net proceeds from long-and short-term borrowings, partially offset by lower deposits and net
redemption of preferred stock. • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, largely offset by net activity in deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits
provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First
Republic acquisition, as well as net payments on long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used
for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 91-95.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax expense. These
adjustments have no impact on net income as reported
by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs;

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

business segments to form one reportable segment, the
Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of
the reorganization, the Firm now has three reportable
business segments: Consumer & Community Banking,
Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth
Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed
basis.

The following table depicts the Firm’s reportable
business segments.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide
various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments or businesses within each
segment join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating
businesses may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other
segments/businesses involved in the transaction. The
segment and business results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.
Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized
in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic
conditions and other factors, which may impact the
allocation of net interest income to the segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 79-84 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to
Line of business equity on page 48, and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–85
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Primarily includes operating lease income and commissions and other fees. Operating lease income was $682
million and $704 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.3 billion and $1.4
billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(b) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $430 million and $445 million for the three months ended June
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $857 million and $852 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $39 million and $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, and $38 million and $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively.

(d) In the second quarter of 2023, substantially all of the expense associated with First Republic was reported in
Corporate. Commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the expense is aligned to the appropriate LOB.
                                                        23

Net income was $4.2 billion, down 21%.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 3%.

Net interest income was $13.7 billion, flat when
compared with the prior year, reflecting:

• higher Card Services NII on higher revolving
balances, and

• the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending,

offset by

• lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"),
reflecting lower average deposits and deposit margin
compression.

Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher card income reflecting higher net interchange
on increased debit and credit card sales volume, and
higher annual fees, partially offset by an increase in
amortization related to new account origination costs,
reflecting continued growth in the portfolio. P rior-
year net interchange included an increase to the
rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms of
certain reward programs; and

• higher asset management fees, predominantly driven
by higher average market levels.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card
income, asset management fees, and commissions and
other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages
86-88 for additional information on the credit card
rewards liability.

Noninterest expense was $9.4 billion, up 13%,
reflecting First Republic-related expense that was
aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third
quarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and
noncompensation expense.

The increase in expense also reflected:

• higher compensation expense, largely driven by
higher revenue-related compensation, primarily for
advisors and bankers, and an increase in employees,
including in technology, and

• higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by
continued investments in technology and marketing.

The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million,
predominantly driven by $706 million in Card Services,
primarily due to the seasoning of newer vintages and
continued credit normalization, and

• a $579 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, primarily in Card Services,
predominantly driven by loan growth and updates to
certain macroeconomic variables.

The provision in the prior year was $1.9 billion,
reflecting net charge-offs of $1.3 billion and a $611
million net addition to the allowance for credit
losses, including $408 million to establish the
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-
related commitments, and $203 million in Card
Services.

pages 59-78 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages

portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $9.0 billion, down 14% .

Net revenue was $35.4 billion, up 5% .

Net interest income was $27.4 billion, up 3% , driven
by:

• higher Card Services NII on higher revolving
balances, and

• the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending,

largely offset by

• lower NII in BWM, reflecting lower average deposits
and deposit margin compression.

Noninterest revenue was $7.9 billion, up 11% ,
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees reflecting higher
average market levels, including the timing impact of
First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net inflows,
as well as higher commissions from annuity sales in
BWM,

• higher card income driven by higher net interchange
on increased debit and credit card sales volume, as
well as higher annual fees, largely offset by an
increase in amortization related to new account
origination costs, reflecting continued growth in the
portfolio, and

• higher production revenue in Home Lending, including
the timing impact of First Republic.

Refer to Executive Overview on pages 5-8 and Note 26
for additional information on First Republic.

Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 14% ,

The provision for credit losses was $4.6 billion,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $3.9 billion, up $1.6 billion,
including $1.5 billion in Card Services, reflecting
the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit
normalization, and $85 million in Auto, driven by a
decline in used vehicle valuations, and

• a $613 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, consisting of:

– $753 million in Card Services, predominantly due to
the seasoning of newer vintages, loan growth, and
updates to certain macroeconomic variables,

partially offset by
                                                        24                                                         
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending,
primarily due to improvements in the outlook for home
prices in the first quarter of 2024.

The provision in the prior year was $3.3 billion,
reflecting net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, a $553
million net addition to the allowance for credit
losses, predominantly driven by Card Services, and a
$408 million net addition to the allowance for credit
losses to establish the allowance for the First
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the
second quarter of 2023.

Quarterly results

Net revenue was $17.9 billion, up 9%.

Banking & Payments revenue was $9.0 billion, up 9%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $2.5 billion, up 46%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 50%,
reflecting higher fees across products. The Firm
ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,
according to Dealogic.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.1 billion , up 51%,
predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuance
in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds and high-grade
bonds .

– Equity underwriting fees were $495 million, up 56% ,
driven by follow-on offerings, IPOs and private
placements, reflecting wallet share gains amid
favorable market conditions.

– Advisory fees were $785 million, up 45%, driven by a
higher number of large completed transactions compared
with a challenging prior-year quarter.

• Payments revenue was $4.5 billion , down 4%, driven
by deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates
paid and higher deposit-related client credits,
largely offset by fee growth due to higher volumes.

• Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11%,
predominantly driven by the impact of the First
Republic acquisition, lower fair value losses on
credit protection purchased against certain retained
loans and lending-related commitments, and the impact
of higher rates.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.0
billion, up 8%. Markets revenue was $7.8 billion, up
10%.

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.0 billion, up 21%,
driven by strong performance in Equity Derivatives and
Prime Finance.

million, compared with a gain of $36 million in the
prior year.

Noninterest expense was $9.2 billion, up 12%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation, primarily
revenue-related compensation, higher legal expense and
higher volume-related non-compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was $384 million,
reflecting:

• a $220 millio n net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, driven by the impact of incorporating
the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled
credit loss estimates, as well as net downgrade
activity, primarily in Real Estate, largely offset by
the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related
commitment portfolios, and

• net charge-offs of $164 million, of which
approximately half was in Office.

The provision in the prior year was $1.1 billion,
reflecting an addition of $608 million to establish
the allowance for the First Republic loans and
lending-related commitments. The net addition also
reflected $389 million driven by updates to certain
assumptions related to office real estate, as well as
net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that

are reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 75 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $1.3 billion, up 3%.

Net revenue was $5.3 billion, up 6%. Net interest
income was $1.6 billion, up 2%. Noninterest revenue
was $3.6 billion, up 8%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.4 billion, up
15%, predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees reflecting higher
average market levels and strong net inflows, and

• higher performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank of $2.8 billion was
flat when compared with the prior year, and reflected:

• higher net interest income, driven by higher average
deposits associated with First Republic which were
transferred to AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of
2023, and wider spreads on loans, offset by deposit
margin compression reflecting higher rates paid, and

• lower noninterest revenue, driven by the
amortization of the purchase discount on certain
acquired short-dated lending-related commitments
associated with First

Republic, predominantly offset by higher management
fees due to strong net inflows and higher average
market levels, and higher brokerage fees.

Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, up 12%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher compensation, including revenue-related
compensation and continued growth in private banking
advisor teams, and

• higher legal expense and distribution fees.

The provision for credit losses was $20 million.

The provision in the prior year was $145 million.

original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the
entity.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.6 billion, up
8%, driven by:

• higher noninterest revenue, reflecting:

– higher management fees on strong net inflows and
higher average market levels, as well as higher
brokerage fees,

partially offset by

– the amortization of the purchase discount on certain
acquired short-dated lending-related commitments
associated with First Republic, and

• higher net interest income, driven by:

– higher loans associated with First Republic and
wider spreads on loans,

largely offset by

– the net impact of deposit margin compression
reflecting higher rates paid, and higher average
deposits associated with First Republic which were
transferred to AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of
2023.

Noninterest expense was $7.0 billion, up 12%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher compensation, including revenue-related
compensation, and continued growth in private banking
advisor teams, and

• higher legal expense, and distribution fees.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$37 million.

The provision in the prior year was $173 million,
predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance
for the First Republic loans and lending-related
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer initiatives.

(c) Included the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

(d) Included a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information.

(e) Included the preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion associated with First Republic.

(f) In the second quarter of 2023, substantially all of the expense associated with First Republic was reported in
Corporate. Commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the expense is aligned to the appropriate LOBs.

(g) Income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition were reflected in the preliminary estimated bargain
purchase gain.

(h) Includes the increase to the FDIC special assessment. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.

Net income was $6.8 billion, compared with $2.6
billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was $10.1 billion, compared with $3.7
billion in the prior year.

Net interest income was $2.4 billion, up 36%, due to
the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates.

Noninterest revenue was $7.8 billion, compared with
$2.0 billion in the prior year. Excluding the $7.9
billion net gain related to Visa shares in the current
quarter and the preliminary estimated bargain purchase
gain of $2.7 billion associated with the First
Republic acquisition in the prior year, revenue was up
$683 million, largely driven by:

• lower investment securities losses related to sales
of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency
MBS, associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO, and

• measurement period adjustments resulting in an
increase to the estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition.

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, up 37%, driven
by:

• the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation,

largely offset by

• lower expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition as substantially all the expense was
reported in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023
and
                                                        41                                                         
subsequently aligned to the appropriate LOBs starting
in the third quarter of 2023 , and

• lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $5 million.

The provision in the prior year was a net benefit of
$243 million, reflecting a reduction in the allowance
for credit losses associated with the deposit placed
with First Republic Bank in the first quarter of 2023.

The current period income tax expense was driven by
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes,
including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares
and the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan
Chase Foundation.

The prior year tax expense benefited from the income
tax expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition reflected in the preliminary estimated
bargain purchase gain.

Net income was $7.5 billion, compared with $2.9
billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was $12.3 billion, compared with $4.7
billion in the prior year.

Net interest income was $4.8 billion, up 39%,
primarily due to the impact of balance sheet mix and
higher rates.

Noninterest revenue was $7.5 billion, compared with
$1.2 billion in the prior year. Excluding the $7.9
billion net gain related to Visa shares in the current
quarter and the preliminary estimated bargain purchase
gain of $2.7 billion associated with the First
Republic acquisition in the prior year, revenue was up
$1.2 billion, predominantly driven by:

• lower investment securities losses related to sales
of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO,
and

• higher revenue associated with the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 118%, driven
by:

• the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation,

• the $725 million increase to the FDIC special
assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024,
and

• higher costs associated with the Firm's
international consumer initiatives,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense, and

• l ower expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition as substantially all the expense was
reported in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023
and subsequently aligned to the appropriate LOBs
starting in the third quarter of 2023.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the FDIC
special assessment.

The provision for credit losses was $32 million .

The provision in the prior year was $127 million.

Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio, and Note 12 for
additional information on the allowance for credit
losses.

The current period income tax expense was driven by
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes,
including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares
and the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan
Chase Foundation.

The prior year tax expense benefited from the income
tax expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition reflected in the preliminary estimated
bargain purchase gain.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international
consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K.,
Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6 Bank.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 86–89 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an
insufficient level or composition of capital to
support the Firm’s business activities and associated
risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks
is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.
Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and
an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).

For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the
capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches
compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements.

In July 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and the FDIC
released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule:
Amendments applicable to large banking organizations
and to banking organizations with significant trading
activity", which is referred to in this Form 10-Q as
the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under the proposal,
changes to the framework would include replacement of
the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based
approach, which would not permit the use of internal
models for the calculation of RWA, other than for
market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer
requirement would be applicable to both the expanded
risk-based approach and the Standardized approach. The
proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital
requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion
or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global
systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed
effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-
based approach.

Under the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal,
the new expanded risk-based approach, when fully
phased-in, would be the Firm's binding constraint. The
Firm is managing its CET1 capital in anticipation of
the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal.

Refer to page 92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for additional information on the U.S. Basel III
proposal.

As of June 30, 2024, the Advanced Total Capital ratio
is the most binding constraint of the Firm's Basel III
risk-based ratios. However, as of June 30, 2024, with
respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the
Standardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate its SLR.

Refer to page 48 of this Form 10-Q and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on SLR.

Capital actions Common stock dividends The Firm’s
common stock dividends are planned as part of the
Capital Management governance framework in line with
the Firm’s capital management objectives. On June 28,
2024, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors
intends to increase the quarterly common stock
dividend to $1.25 per share (up from the current $1.15
per share) for the third quarter of 2024. On May 20,
2024, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors
had declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
$1.15 per share, payable on July 31, 2024. The Firm’s
dividends are subject to approval by the Board of
Directors on a quarterly basis. Common stock On June
28, 2024, the Firm announced that its Board of
Directors had authorized a new $30 billion common
share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2024.
Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized to
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its
previously-approved common share repurchase program
that was announced on April 13, 2022. The following
table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common
stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024
and 2023.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was
imposed on net share repurchases effective January 1, 2023. The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by
the Board of Directors does not establish specific price targets or timetables. Management determines the amount
and timing of common share repurchases based on various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory
considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; current and proposed future capital requirements;
and other investment opportunities. The amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be
substantially more or less than the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the
dynamic nature of the decision-making process. Refer to Capital actions on page 99 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for additional information. Refer to Part II, Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds and Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder

Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities on pages 202-203 of this Form 10-Q and page 35 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K, respectively, for additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity
securities. Preferred stock Preferred stock dividends were $317 million and $373 million, and $714 million and $729
million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the six months ended and
subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Firm issued and redeemed certain series of non-cumulative preferred stock. Refer
to Note 17 of this Form 10-Q and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s preferred stock, including the issuance and redemption of preferred stock. Subordinated Debt Refer to Long-
term funding on page 57 of this Form 10-Q and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information
on the Firm’s subordinated debt. Capital planning and stress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review On
April 5, 2024, the Firm submitted its 2024 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On June 28, 2024, the Firm
announced that its preliminary Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement provided by the Federal Reserve is 3.3%
(up from the current 2.9%), and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory
buffers, is 12.3% (up from the current 11.9%). In addition, consistent with the Firm's press release on June 26,
2024 regarding the potential for higher stress losses, should the Federal Reserve modify the Firm’s stress results,
the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement would likely be modestly higher than 12.3%. The Federal
Reserve will provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024, and that requirement will become
effective on October 1, 2024, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025. Refer to Capital planning and
stress testing on pages 91-92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on CCAR. Other capital
requirements Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") rule
requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC
and eligible long-term debt ("eligible LTD"). The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and eligible
LTD amounts, as well as a representation of these amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total RWA and total
leverage exposure applying the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions as of June 30, 2024 and December

Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm's regulatory
requirement for its eligible LTD to RWA ratio
increased by 50 bps to 10.5%, due to the increase in
the Firm’s GSIB Method 2 requirements. The Firm's
regulatory requirement for its TLAC to RWA ratio
remained at 23.0%. Refer to Risk-based Capital

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to
support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages
102–109 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the
Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk. LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total
net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day
period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the
amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum
LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-
bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s
reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum
of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three
months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June
30, 2023 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR
framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities
may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are
included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared with the three
months ended March 31, 2024, due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA, primarily from a reduction in
cash due to a decline in deposits and the impact of CIB markets activities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR
for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared with the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting
the timing impact associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Executive Overview on pages 5-8 and Note
26 for additional information on First Republic. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may
fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as
a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.
Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional
information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress
testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of adverse
scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress
tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events
or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of
its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company
(“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum
liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be
disrupted.
                                                        51                                                         
                                                                                                                   
   Liquidity sources                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $623
billion and $649 billion as of June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The decrease compared to December 31,
2023, was driven by decreases in excess eligible HQLA
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and in
unencumbered AFS securities, largely offset by an
increase in CIB trading assets.

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm
had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of
available cash and securities, respectively, comprised
of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact
of regulatory haircuts, of approximately $841 billion
and $798 billion, respectively, and unencumbered
marketable securities with a fair value of
approximately $623 billion and $649 billion,
respectively.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
FHLB and the discount window at the Federal Reserve
Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to
such banks of approximately $366 billion and $340
billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and other central banks. Available
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2023
predominantly due to a higher amount of commercial
loans and mortgages pledged at the Federal Reserve
Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and the other central banks as a
primary source of liquidity.
                                                                                                                   
  NSFR                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with
the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's
interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's
U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on the Firm’s website for
additional information.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term

debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-
bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
which are primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB transferred
deposits associated with First Republic to AWM and
CIB. Refer to page 67 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be
impacted.

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended
June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June
30, 2023, reflecting:

• a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due
to increased customer spending, partially offset by
new accounts,

predominantly offset by

• net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result
of client demand in Markets; and net inflows in
Payments, which included the retention of inflows
associated with disruptions in the market in the first
quarter of 2023, predominantly offset by deposit
attrition, which included actions taken to reduce
certain deposits,

• the timing impact of First Republic, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, including new
product offerings in the second quarter of 2024.

Excluding the impact of First Republic, AWM was
relatively flat, reflecting an increase from new
product offerings, offset by continued migration into
higher-yielding investments.

Average deposits were higher for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June
30, 2023, reflecting:

• net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result
of client demand in Markets; and net inflows in
Payments, which included the retention of inflows
associated with disruptions in the market in the first
quarter of 2023, largely offset by deposit attrition,
which included actions taken to reduce certain
deposits,

• the timing impact of First Republic, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, including new
product offerings in the second quarter of 2024,

predominantly offset by

• a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due
to increased customer spending, partially offset by
new accounts, and

• excluding the impact of First Republic, a decline in
AWM, driven by continued migration into higher-
yielding investments, predominantly offset by new
product offerings.

Period-end deposits decreased from December 31, 2023,
reflecting: • a decline in CCB in existing accounts,
primarily driven by seasonal tax outflows and
migration into higher-yielding investments, largely
offset by new accounts, predominantly offset by •
higher deposits in CIB due to net inflows in
Securities Services and Payments, partially offset by
net maturities of structured notes in Markets, •
higher deposits in Corporate predominantly driven by
new product offerings related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, and • higher
balances in AWM driven by new product offerings, and
an increase in deposits in existing accounts due to a
change in product offerings associated with First
Republic, predominantly offset by continued migration
into higher-yielding investments. Refer to the Firm’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business
Segment Results on pages 15-16 and pages 20-43,
respectively, for further information on deposit and
liability balance trends, as well as Note 26 for
additional information on the First Republic
acquisition. Refer to Note 3 for further information
on structured notes. Certain deposits are covered by
insurance protection that provides additional funding
stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit
insurance protection may be available to depositors in
the countries in which the deposits are placed. For
example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection for
deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. R
efer to pages 105–106 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form
10-K for additional information on the Firm's total
uninsured deposits.

The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.
and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining
maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S.
time deposits are based on data that the Firm
calculates periodically under applicable FDIC
regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all
non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2024,
compared with December 31, 2023, driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and higher secured financing of trading
assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower
levels at year-end.

The increase in secured other borrowed funds at June
30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was predominantly due
to higher financing requirements in Markets. For the
average three months ended June 30, 2024 , compared to
the prior year period, the increase was due to higher
financing requirements in Markets, partially offset by
maturities in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to

investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2024 from
December 31, 2023 was due to lower issuances primarily
as a result of short-term liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at June
30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was predominantly
driven by higher net issuances of structured notes in
CIB, due to client demand.
                                                        56                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal
long-term funding plan.

Unsecured funding and issuance

The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to
provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the increase in average structured notes compared
to the prior year periods was attributable to net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand.

The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 and Note 20 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan
securitizations.

The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
Notes 4 and 13 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2024, were as follows:

(d) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB, and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB.

(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

(i) At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and
insured by U.S. government agencies of $138 million and $182 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $17.3 billion and $13.3 billion for the three
months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $16.2 billion and $12.4 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,
2023 predominantly driven by retained residential real
estate loans. Residential real estate: The residential
real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale
and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans decreased compared to December 31,
2023, predominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales,
net of originations. Net recoveries were higher for
the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the
same period in the prior year due to loan sales. Loans
held-for-sale increased from December 31, 2023,
predominantly driven by a transfer of certain retained
loans in anticipation of securitization. Nonaccrual
loans at fair value decreased compared to December 31,
2023, predominantly driven by net sales in CIB. At
June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was
$89.6 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of
this portfolio is comparable with the performance of
the broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying
value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$15.0 billion at June 30, 2024. The carrying value of
home equity lines of credit outstanding included $4.0
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only
to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and
$3.9 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans Refer to

real estate loans. Modified residential real estate
loans For the three and six months ended June 30,
2024, residential real estate financial difficulty
modifications ("FDMs") were $68 million and $98
million, respectively, and $35 million and $75 million
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively. Loans subject to trial modification
where the terms of the loans have not been permanently
modified, and loans subject to discharge under Chapter
7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans"), were not
material for the three and six months ended June 30,
2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2023 Form 10-K and Note 11 of this Form 10-Q for

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, generally consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
portfolio decreased when compared to December 31,
2023, predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net
charge-offs increased for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in
the prior year predominantly due to higher scored auto
net charge-offs of $37 million and $87 million,
respectively, reflecting a decline in used vehicle
valuations. Refer to Note 13 for further information
on securitization activity. Nonperforming assets The

Total credit card loans increased from December 31,
2023 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving
balances. The June 30, 2024 30+ day delinquency rate
of 2.08% decreased from 2.14% at December 31, 2023,
and the June 30, 2024 90+ day delinquency rate of
1.07% was relatively flat compared to 1.05% at
December 31, 2023, reflecting seasonality, in line
with expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to
the same periods in the prior year as newer vintages
season and credit normalization continues .

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,
credit card FDMs were $259 million and $491 million,
respectively, and $181 million and $326 million for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively. FDMs increased for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same
periods in the prior year due to higher delinquencies,
reflecting growth in the portfolio.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 68-71 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain
operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting
classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to
Business Developments on page 8 for additional information. As of June 30, 2024, lending-related commitments
increased by $8.2 billion, driven by Technology, Media & Telecommunications, including held-for-sale commitments,
and SPEs, partially offset by a decrease in Asset Managers. As of June 30, 2024, nonperforming exposure increased
by $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and in Industrials, resulting from
downgrades. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, wholesale net charge-offs were $353 million, largely in Real
Estate, concentrated in Office, and Individuals.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2024,
may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized
exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.8 billion and $41.4 billion as of June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, representing approximately 3.7% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of
the $46.8 billion, $42.7 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by net downgrades
in Real Estate, concentrated in Office and Multifamily, and held-for-sale commitments in Technology and Media.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The industry
of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on
deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable
debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors
the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and
the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s
obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair
value of the collateral declines. Because of these
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses
based on the value of the collateral and probability
of borrower default. These receivables are reported
within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K
for further information on the Firm’s accounting
policies for the allowance for credit losses.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the

derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, the
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP.
Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts
through the use of legally enforceable master netting
arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage
of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to
collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange
spot trades, which are not typically covered by
collateral agreements due to their short maturity and
centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 87% at both June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. Refer to Note 4 for additional information
on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a
further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $54.7 billion and
$54.9 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result
of market movements. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and
other cash collateral that may be used as security
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the
Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of
liquid securities is consistent with the definition of
high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
receivables balances and is not included in the tables
below, it is available as security against potential
exposure that could arise should the fair value of the
client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s
favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on
the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative
transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's
allowance for credit losses generally consists of : •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and
is presented separately on the Consolidated balance
sheets, • the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable
and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on
investment securities, which is reflected in
investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The
allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2024 was
$25.5 billion , reflecting a net addition of $749
million from December 31, 2023. The net addition to
the allowance for credit losses included: • $653
million in consumer , reflecting a $753 million net
addition in Card Services, predominantly driven by the
seasoning of newer vintages, loan growth, and updates
to certain macroeconomic variables, and a $125 million
net reduction in Home Lending, and • $47 million in
wholesale , driven by – a net addition of $707
million, reflecting net downgrade activity, primarily
in Real Estate, and included approximately $200
million associated with incorporating the First
Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss
estimates, predominantly offset by – a net reduction
of $660 million, primarily due to the impact of
changes in the loan and lending-related commitment
portfolios and updates to certain macroeconomic
variables. The Firm has maintained the additional
weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first
quarter of 2023 to reflect ongoing uncertainties and
downside risks related to the geopolitical and
macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for
credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of
five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in
a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at
5.3% in the second quarter of 2025, and a weighted
average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.1% lower than
the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of
2025.

The following table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

an allowance for credit losses of $278 million and $18 million, respectively, associated with certain accounts
receivable in CIB.

(d) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2024,
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio,
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $587.4
billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
41-43 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
51-58 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 79-84
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve based on market circumstances and in line with
its strategic initiatives, including the Firm’s
environmental and social goals. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as of June 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
135–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify

JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
140–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

Corporate VaR, Daily Risk Management VaR and VaR backtesting exceptions reflect the impact of Visa C shares that
are held at fair value and therefore captured in VaR. Refer to Note 2 on page 111 for additional information.

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can
vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) The impact of the business segment reorganization was not material to Total CIB VaR. Prior periods have not
been revised. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 20 for additional information.

(b) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR
for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans
and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include
the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model
governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio
VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were
also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM
VaR due to the increase associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-
related commitments. The VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

(e) Includes Visa C shares and a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.

Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30,
2024 increased by $8 million, when compared with March
31, 2024, predominantly due to the impact of the Visa
C shares in Corporate VaR. Average CIB VaR for the
three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $3
million, when compared to March 31, 2024 due to
volatility rolling out of the one-year historical
look-back period impacting Fixed Income and Credit
Portfolio VaR.

Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30,
2024 increased by $9 million, compared with the same

CIB VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2024
decreased by $6 million, compared with the same period
in the prior year driven by volatility rolling out of

Fixed Income partially offset by an increase
associated with credit protection purchased against
certain retained loans and lending-related commitments
within Credit Portfolio VaR.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The increase in VaR and
subsequent decline observed in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by changes in Visa C share exposure
in the Firm's Corporate VaR.

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 152 of the 258 days, and observed 14
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 42 of
the 65 days, and the Firm observed five VaR backtesting exceptions primarily driven by price changes in Visa C
shares.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended June 30, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities which are included in VaR, but also from
the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which
include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the
investment securities portfolio, and associated
derivative instruments.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities,
long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges,
and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk
management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as
described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure
from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising
from the Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of
the hedges in these simulations would increase U.S.
dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar
sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign
exchange risk on page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for more information.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential
change to a net interest income baseline, over the
following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.
These scenarios include a parallel shift involving
changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an
equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding
short-term rates constant and increasing long-term
rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing
short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant
or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing
long-term rates. These scenarios consider many
different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and
require management judgment. Therefore, the actual
amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular
time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through
the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In
addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level
of loans across the industry and competition for
deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as
deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit
rates paid could change upon a given change in market
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to
customer behavior and competition for deposits.

The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts
of deposit balances, both of which are especially
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to
the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. In the second quarter of
2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid
assumptions which take into account observed pricing
and client and customer behavior during the most
recent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates
paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios,
resulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in
higher interest rate scenarios, and an increase in
negative sensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios.
While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate
exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not
represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income
(Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional
information).

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates. The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities as of June 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s
actual and forecasted balance sheet and the update in the second quarter of 2024 of the deposit rates paid
assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale deposit products based upon observed pricing and client and customer
behavior during the most recent economic cycle. In the absence of this update, the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities
as of June 30, 2024, would have been lower by approximately $900 million and $1.9 billion to the +100 basis points
and +200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by approximately
$1.0 billion and $1.8 billion to the -100 basis points and -200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term
and parallel rate scenarios.

Economic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of
earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions
for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk
management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the
EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value disclosure. For example, certain assets and
liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in
the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed
on page 112 in Note 2 financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.

  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain
counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is
now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 144–145 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2024 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including
client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure
to Germany when compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of
Germany primarily due to client-driven market-making activities and higher client deposits in CIB. The Firm
continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which
excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently
believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is not material. Refer to Note 24 on pages 183-184 for information
concerning Russian litigation.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and
Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-77 and Note 12
of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.
HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the
Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the
loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed
as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk
rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio,
and the ongoing integration of products and systems,
the allowance for credit losses for the acquired
wholesale portfolio was measured based on other
facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk
characteristics and not based on modeled estimates.
The acquired wholesale portfolio was incorporated into
the Firm's modeled credit loss estimates commencing in
the second quarter of 2024, and therefore is now
reflected in the wholesale sensitivity analysis below,
resulting in an increase of approximately $200
million. Refer to Note 26 for additional information
on the First Republic acquisition.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher over the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 3.0% in the second quarter of 2025.
                                                        86                                                         
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of
June 30, 2024, reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario due to the weight
placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and
nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be
simply extrapolated for more severe changes in
macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future
changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30,
2024, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under
its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario.
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects
in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $750 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $3.8 billion for credit card loans ▪ An
increase of approximately $4.3 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the
Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable
and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2024.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative
receivables total reflects the impact of netting
adjustments; however, the $10.2 billion of derivative
receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to
a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to
the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would
be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including geopolitical tensions and hostilities;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyber attacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further discussion of the Firm's business
segments. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic
Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the FDIC. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to
integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s
businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale
portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different
from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that
this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the
Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines
whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting
interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a
further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and
liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same
counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance
sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing
balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally
enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the
specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on
offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint Ventures:
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method The guidance
expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can
elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional amortization method. This method
requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the tax
benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the
associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including that
substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted
on January 1, 2024 under the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to
the classification and timing of the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-
oriented investments. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously
recognized in other income is now being recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted in a
decrease to retained earnings of $ 161million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense and the effective tax
rate by approximately $ 450million and twopercentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no
material impact to net income.
                                                        96                                                         
The guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other income
tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the proportional
amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant
modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's
relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Notes 5 and 13 for additional information.

(a) At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 131.3billion and $
78.5billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        100                                                        
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion. Included in these balances at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
were trading assets of $ 45million and $ 42million, respectively, and other assets of $ 964million and $
984million, respectively.

(e) At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included $ 10.5billion and $ 10.2billion, respectively, of residential
first-lien mortgages, and $ 5.4billion and $ 6.0billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages.
Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and
government agencies of $ 4.5billion and $ 2.9billion, respectively.

(f) At June 30, 2024, includes the Firm’s Visa C shares that are held at fair value. Refer to page 111 for
additional information.

(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-
parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 708million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 810million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 11million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $
1.5billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 626million and non-trading loans of $ 720million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 776million including $ 654million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as
well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range
of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)
for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level
3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3
financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or
losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such
level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2023, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 110 for further information on changes impacting
items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and six months ended June 30, 2024 Level 3 assets were
$ 25.6billion at June 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $ 860million from March 31, 2024, and an increase of $
1.9billion from December 31, 2023. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was largely driven by
higher: • MSRs of $ 242million, and • Other Assets of $ 391million predominantly due to purchases. The increase for
the six months ended June 30, 2024 was predominantly driven by higher: • Gross derivative receivables of $
1.3billion due to gains, purchases and net transfers largely offset by settlements, • MSRs of $ 325million, and •
Other Assets of $ 444million predominantly due to purchases. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Refer to the
sections below for additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a
recurring basis For the three months ended June 30, 2024, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into
level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 2
into level 3 included the following: • $ 759million and $ 798million of gross equity derivative receivables and
gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 3
into level 2 included the following: • $ 987million of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase
in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended June 30,
2023, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.2billion of gross interest rate
derivative payables as a result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. • $ 760million of
non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, there were no
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, significant transfers from
level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.6billion of gross interest rate derivative payables as a result
of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. • $ 901million of gross equity derivative receivables
as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $
917million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the six months ended June 30, 2023,
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1.3billion and $ 827million of gross
equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the
observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the
quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

Gains and losses The following describes significant
components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses)
for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
rollforward tables on pages 103-108 for further
information on these instruments. Three months ended
June 30, 2024 • $ 682million of net gains on assets,
predominantly driven by gains in net derivative
receivables due to market movements and gains in MSR
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. •
$ 1million of net losses on liabilities, driven by
losses in deposits and short-term borrowings
predominantly offset by gains in trading liabilities -
debt and equity instruments and long-term debt due to
market movements. Three months ended June 30, 2023 • $
752million of net losses on assets, driven by losses
in net derivative receivables due to market movements.
• $ 328million of net losses on liabilities, driven by
losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Six
months ended June 30, 2024 • $ 117million of net
losses on assets, driven by losses in net derivative
receivables due to market movements largely offset by
gains in loans due to market movements and gains in
MSR reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher
rates. • $ 517million of net losses on liabilities,
driven by losses in long-term debt due to market
movements. Six months ended June 30, 2023 • $
139million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in
MSR reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher
rates. • $ 1.8billion of net losses on liabilities,
predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due
to market movements. Refer to Note 14 for information
on MSRs.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2 common shares
("Visa B-2 shares") and 37.2million Visa Class B common shares reflected in the Firm's principal investment
portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.

The Visa Class B common shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January
24, 2024. On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1 shares.
On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2million Visa B-1 shares in
exchange for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”). The Visa C shares
are included in Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on page 99. Visa's acceptance
resulted in an initial gain of $ 8.0billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In addition, the current
quarter also reflected other Visa-related activity, including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and
derivative instruments, as well as dividends, resulting in the $ 7.9billion net gain on Visa shares. As of June 30,
2024, approximately $ 2billion of Visa C shares are subject to a lock-up restriction that expires on August 4,
2024.

The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common
shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters
involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875at June 30, 2024 and may be
adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation
matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown.
Accordingly, as of June 30, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa
B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of
these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to
Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.

In connection with prior sales of Visa Class B common shares prior to the redenomination to Visa B-1 shares, the
Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the
risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative
instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. Refer to page 194 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for further information.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is
recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.
(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.
(c) As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic for
other unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $ 854million and $ 1.1billion, respectively, recorded in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Notes 22 and 26 for additional
information.
The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 177 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material both for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining
contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for loans, long-term debt and
long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 11.5billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $
55million and $ 97million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
128 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        119                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 48.3billion at both June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $ 64.1billion and $ 70.0billion at June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative
instruments.

related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 3.2billion and $ 5.6billion at June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $ 25.8billion and $ 19.3billion,
respectively. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $
535million and zero, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 67.6billion and $ 83.9billion,
of which $ 63.1billion and $ 68.0billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is
the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and
forward starting layers. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(
1.8) billion and $( 165) million, which is comprised of $( 1.3) billion and $ 73million for active hedging
relationships, and $( 485) million and $( 238) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer
to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line
item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended June 30,
2024 and 2023.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 2.0) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at June 30, 2024, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

six months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax gain of $ 10million to other revenue. During
the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm reclassified a pre-tax loss of $( 41) million to other revenue related
to the acquisition of CIFM. The amounts reclassified for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were not material.

wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.

(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.

(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.

(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against
certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit
derivatives and credit-related notes.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The
maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed
portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities,
however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the table for the types of securities being hedged.
Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 555million and $ 1.0billion of HTM securities for the three and six months ended June 30,
2024, respectively, and $ 520million and $ 4.1billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively.
(c) Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which
permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and
municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net pre-tax
unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. Refer to Note 19 of this Form 10-Q and Note 1
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information.
(d) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 177million and
$ 128million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
(e) Excludes $ 3.4billion and $ 2.8billion of accrued interest receivable at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion
of accounting policies for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE
and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 4.9billion and $ 4.6billion, at June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates
rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
all HTM securities were rated investment grade and
were current and accruing, with approximately 99%
rated at least AA+.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities was $ 177million and $ 104million as of
June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for
the six months ended June 30, 2023. Refer to Note 10
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further
discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM
securities. Selected impacts of investment securities

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $ 52million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.3) billion at June
30, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $
125million at June 30, 2024.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS and six yearsfor both agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm held $ 417million and $ 505million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a
sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.
The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB.
(b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to SPEs, financial institutions, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and
individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within
CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2024,
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 42million and $ 44million and $ 85million
and $ 89million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at June 30, 2024.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of residential real estate loans to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that
generally provide various modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not
limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions,
other-than-insignificant payment deferral and
principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been
required under the terms of the original agreement,
are considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information.
Financial effects of FDMs For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2024, residential real estate FDMs were
$ 68million and $ 98million, respectively. The
financial effects of the FDMs, which were
predominantly in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans by 7years and
10years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual
interest rate from 7.59% to 6.04% and 7.58% to 5.50%
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,
respectively. For the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $
35million and $ 75million, respectively. The financial
effects of the FDMs, which were largely in the form of
term extensions and interest rate reductions, included
extending the weighted-average life of the loans by
15years and 18years, and reducing the weighted-average
contractual interest rate from 6.90% to 4.21% and
6.75% to 4.01% for the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, there were noadditional commitments
to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty
whose loans have been modified as FDMs. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, loans
subject to a trial modification, where the terms of
the loans have not been permanently modified, and
Chapter 7 loans were not material.

Defaults of FDMs FDMs that defaulted in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2024 and were reported as
FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were
not material. FDMs that defaulted in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023 and were reported as FDMs
on or after January 1, 2023, the date that the Firm
adopted the changes to the TDR accounting guidance
were not material. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's
2023 Form 10-K for further information. Active and
suspended foreclosure At June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Firm had residential real estate loans,
excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies,
with a carrying value of $ 619million and $
566million, respectively, that were not included in
REO, but were in the process of active or suspended
foreclosure.

(a) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for
60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and
will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Defaults of FDMs

FDMs that defaulted in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve months
prior to the default were not material. FDMs that defaulted in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and
were reported as FDMs on or after January 1, 2023, the date that the Firm adopted the changes to the TDR accounting
guidance were not material. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information.

For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses
twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans. The following tables
provide information on internal risk rating and gross charge-offs.

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit
Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for
further information.
(b) At June 30, 2024 and 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had
an allowance for credit losses of $ 278million and $ 18million, respectively, associated with certain accounts
receivable in CIB.
(c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans.
(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(e) At June 30, 2024 and 2023, lending-related commitments excluded $ 19.8billion and $ 18.4billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 964.7billion and $ 881.5billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 32.6billion and $ 19.3billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2024 was $ 25.5billion ,
reflecting a net addition of $ 749million from December 31, 2023. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses included: • $ 653million in consumer , reflecting a $ 753million net addition in Card Services,
predominantly driven by the seasoning of newer vintages, loan growth, and updates to certain macroeconomic
variables, and a $ 125million net reduction in Home Lending, and • $ 47million in wholesale , driven by – a net
addition of $ 707million, reflecting net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and included approximately $
200million associated with incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss
estimates, predominantly offset by – a net reduction of $ 660million, primarily due to the impact of changes in the
loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. The Firm has
maintained the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023 to reflect ongoing
uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance
for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the
table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.3% in the second quarter of 2025,
and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.1% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth
quarter of 2025.

assumptions for the periods presented:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        159                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests. Refer to page 165 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies
and liquidation losses.

As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-
securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial
paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 2.7billion and $ 9.8billion of the
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs
and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued
by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 12.1billion and $ 10.8billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to
extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their
municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer
TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the
Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial
interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests
in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.4billion and $ 3.1billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These
include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement
agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual
credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the
underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,
the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated
balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party
transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does
not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,
represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 33.6billion and $ 35.1billion at June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, of which $ 14.0billion and $ 14.7billion was unfunded at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its
capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on
off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance which
expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can
elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for
                                                        162                                                        
using the proportional amortization method. Refer to
Note 1 for further information. The proportional
amortization method requires the cost of eligible
investments, within an elected program, be amortized
in proportion to the tax benefits received with the
resulting amortization reported directly in income tax
expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits
and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain
criteria to be eligible, including that substantially
all of the return is from income tax credits and other
income tax benefits. In addition, under this method
deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the
investment is now amortized in proportion to the
income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received. Delayed equity contributions that are
unconditional and legally binding or conditional and
probable of occurring are recorded in other
liabilities with a corresponding increase in the
carrying value of the investment. The guidance also
requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when
significant modifications or events occur that result
in a change in the nature of the investment or a
change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying
project. During the period, there were no significant
modifications or events that resulted in a change in
the nature of an eligible investment or a change in
the Firm's relationship with the underlying project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected to
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $ 5.3billion and
$ 5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
7.4billion and $ 7.3billion, respectively.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions
pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,
the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for
the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement
of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these
loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of
loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the
purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.
The following table summarizes the activities related
to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in
securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to
material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to
repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed

Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses
The table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized
financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing
involvement as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s
only form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to
repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with
its loan sale or servicing contracts.

Note 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and
other intangible assets

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the accounting policies related to
goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other
intangible assets. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon
completion of a business combination as the difference
between the purchase price and the fair value of the
net assets acquired, and can be adjusted up to one
year from the acquisition date as additional
information pertaining to facts and circumstances that
existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be
an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill
impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in
capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s
reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a
future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of June 30, 2024, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of
business performance. In addition, as a result of the business segment reorganization, the Firm assessed goodwill
for impairment. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2024,
or December 31, 2023, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2024 or
2023.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in

Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded
at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including
core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized
over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets
with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed
periodically for impairment. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other intangible assets consisted of
finite-lived intangible assets of $ 1.9billion and $ 2.0billion, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived
intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $ 1.2billion for both periods.

Firm as lessee

At June 30, 2024, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries
were obligated under a number of noncancellable
leases, predominantly operating leases for premises
and equipment used primarily for business purposes.

Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term.
The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases
were as follows:

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. The
Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as
a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal insured depository
institution ("IDI") subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital
requirements established by its primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January
1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit,
provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected
the remaining benefit of $ 720million and $
1.4billion, respectively, associated with the CECL
capital transition provisions. Similarly, as of
January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased out 75% of the
other CECL capital transition provisions which
impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. Refer
to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business
banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the
same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

(i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums
that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and
deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred
amounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold.

(j) As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic for
residential real estate lending-related commitments totaling $ 550million and $ 630million, respectively, for auto
and other lending-related commitments totaling $ 69million and $ 148million, respectively, and for other unfunded
commitments to extend credit totaling $ 854million and $ 1.1billion, respectively. Refer to Note 26 for additional
information.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase
demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding litigation.
                                                        180                                                        
Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment
networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the
Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,
retains a contingent liability for disputed processed
credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved
in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the
cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount
to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction
to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the
amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss
for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.
The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or
obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 179. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 179 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged
assets.

Total pledged assets do not include assets of
consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the
liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for
additional information on assets and liabilities of
consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on the Firm’s securities financing
activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023
Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s
long-term debt.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.
The following table presents the fair value of
collateral accepted.

Contingencies

As of June 30, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,
regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations
and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to
approximately $ 1.7billion at June 30, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based
upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of
reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be
made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves
significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that
many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the
Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of
the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the
uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions
concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties
or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular
proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the
likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably
possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are
descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)
SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the
validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by
1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a
new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and
the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In
addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions
arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons
for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010
and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects
developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential
units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,
and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the
offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the
inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions
                                                        182                                                        
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following
the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission
matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation
matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain
parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named
plaintiffs in March 2023. In May 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the
District Court's decision, and in July 2024, plaintiffs’ subsequent petition for en banc review by the full Court
of Appeals was denied. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged
underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and
Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K.
Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on
an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains
subject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm is responding to inquiries
from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding the transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. In
connection with this, the CFPB Staff has informed the Firm that it is authorized to pursue a resolution of the
inquiries or file an enforcement action. The Firm is evaluating next steps, including litigation. Interchange
Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that
Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees
and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled the class action
seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement
has been approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal.
Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in
September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the
motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive
class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system-
wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next steps. Of the
merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar
allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions
remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over 70% of
the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate
Investigations and Litigation . JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and
entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other
bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the
Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the
European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-
impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of
Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in
various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions
related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal
of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a
lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other
defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market
for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed in November 2023 remains pending. The Firm has
resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international
sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with
individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and
threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make under, and is
contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims
filed
                                                        183                                                        
against other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements
concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. As to
claims against the Firm, a Russian court entered judgment against the Firm in one claim in February 2024, which was
executed in July 2024 against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian
court’s decision. In separate claims, in April 2024, Russian courts ordered an interim freeze of assets in Russia
(including funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named
defendants) pending a determination on the underlying claims. Russian courts may rule similarly in other cases,
including ordering freezes and seizure of assets. The Firm challenged the April 2024 freeze orders in the Russian
courts and in a New York federal court action, and a Russian court has issued an order instructing the Firm to
discontinue the New York action. The value of the current claims and the orders to freeze assets against the Firm
exceed the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. If further claims are enforced despite
the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the
Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations.
SEC Inquiries . The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs
within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and
selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the
timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-
party managed private funds. The Firm continues to cooperate and is currently engaged in resolution discussions
with the SEC. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in resolutions Securities Lending Antitrust
Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan
Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and
New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange
trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily
approved, and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class
actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against
the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits
relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and
related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and
fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC
in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above.
In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the
plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting state claims of breaches of
fiduciary duty and federal claims of violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the
Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements
which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. In March
2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over
the remaining state claims. Trading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries
regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade
surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not
feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and
data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not
originally surveilled and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the
identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which
largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining
rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm entered into
resolutions with the OCC and the Board of Governors of the FRB in March 2024 and with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission in May 2024. The resolutions required the Firm to, among other things, pay aggregate civil penalties of
$ 450million, which the Firm has paid, and to complete the Firm’s remediation. The Firm has also engaged an
independent compliance consultant as required by the resolutions. The Firm does not expect any disruption of
service to clients as a result of these resolutions. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
                                                        184                                                        
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance
with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is
probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm
evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments
in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 317million and $ 420million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the
future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the
claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a
large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the
eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses,
fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current
knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and
after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,
that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the
Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in
such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed
the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a
result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular
period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan
Chase’s income for that period.

  Note 25 – Business segments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable
business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to
form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the reorganization, the Firm
now has threereportable business segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &
Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for
a definition of managed basis. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment
results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly,
revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on
a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for
additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each
business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Note 32 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver.
The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain,
which represents the excess of the estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired above the purchase
price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition
constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP.
Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed were generally
measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1,
2023. The determination of those fair values required
management to make certain market-based assumptions
about expected future cash flows, discount rates and
other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition.
The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a
reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain
purchase gain. The First Republic acquisition resulted
in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $
2.7billion. As the one-year measurement period
permitted by U.S. GAAP has now concluded, management
has finalized its fair value estimates for the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The final bargain
purchase gain of $ 2.9billion reflects adjustments
made during the measurement period to the fair value
of the net assets acquired, including an increase of $
119million and $ 103million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Certain
matters related to the final settlement remain
outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. Any
subsequent adjustments will not impact the final
bargain purchase gain and will be reflected in Other
income. Refer to Note 34 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form
10-K for further information on the First Republic
acquisition.

The computation of the purchase price, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of
the First Republic acquisition and the related bargain purchase gain are presented below, and reflects adjustments
made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the
estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2billion. Additional
adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain
estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the
results of operations in future periods.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan

  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2024, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024
and 2023 and the consolidated statements of cash flows
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information
set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet information as of December 31, 2023, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which
                                                        196                                                        
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing
loan upon meeting specified loan balance and
anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically

maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which

include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual
fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star
rating is the best rating and represents the top 10%
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star
rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average
of the performance associated with a fund’s three-,
five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star
ratings are provided at the individual share class
level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than
three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the

assigned peer categories and the asset values used to
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable
fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund
rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S.
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except
for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the
fund level. The performance data may have been
different if all share classes had been included. Past
performance is not indicative of future results.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd
quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset
values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based
on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong
Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all
share classes had been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
