  Item 8.01.  Other Events  
                            
Effective June 1, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMorgan
Financial”) became a direct subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”) and all obligations owed to
JPMorgan
Financial by other subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase under its intercompany agreements became obligations of JPMorgan
Chase.

As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Financial has no
independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and the collection of intercompany
obligations.
Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase, substantially all of JPMorgan Financial’s assets
relate to obligations
of JPMorgan Chase to make payments under loans made to JPMorgan Chase by JPMorgan Financial or under other
intercompany agreements.
As a result, JPMorgan Financial is dependent upon payments from JPMorgan Chase to meet its obligations under its
securities. If
JPMorgan Chase does not make payments to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Financial is unable to make payments on
its securities, holders
of JPMorgan Financial securities may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase, and that
guarantee will rank
pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase.
