of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the
first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview JPMorgan
Chase reported net income of $8.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022, or $2.63 per share, on net revenue of
$30.7 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 13% and ROTCE of 16%. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2022
included a net increase in the allowance for credit losses of $902 million and a loss of $524 million in Credit
Adjustments & Other in CIB. • The Firm had net income of $8.3 billion, down 42%. • Total net revenue was down 5%.

– Noninterest revenue was $16.8 billion, down 13%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, lower net production
revenue in Home Lending, and losses on legacy equity investments compared to gains in the prior year in Corporate.
The decrease also reflected the loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. – Net interest income was $13.9 billion,
up 8%. Net interest income excluding Markets was $11.8 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by balance sheet growth
and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans. • Noninterest
expense was $19.2 billion, up 2%, predominantly driven by investments and structural expense across the LOBs,
largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including revenue-related compensation in CIB. The
prior-year expense included a $550 million contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. • The provision for credit losses
was $1.5 billion, driven by; – a net additi on of $902 million to the allowance for credit losses, which largely
reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on the
adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the potential effects associated with higher inflation,
changes in monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the
allowance also included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM, and – $582 million
of net charge-offs, down $475 million, driven by Card. The prior year provision was a net benefit of $4.2 billion,
reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion. • The total allowance for credit
losses was $19.6 billion at March 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage
ratio of 1.69%, compared with 2.42% in the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.6 billion at
March 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.7 billion from the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting
improved credit performance in consumer; and in wholesale, net portfolio activity as well as client-specific
upgrades, largely offset by client-specific downgrades, including Russia and Russia-associated clients. • Firmwide
average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 5%, driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB. • Firmwide average deposits of

economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets
activity, the geopolitical environment, the
competitive environment, client and customer activity
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in
the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does
business. Each of these factors will affect the
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to
make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and
operations in response to ongoing developments in the
business, economic, regulatory and legal environments
in which it operates.

  War in Ukraine                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Firm’s
business activities related to Russia have generally
been limited to assisting clients with fulfilling or
terminating pre-existing obligations and managing
their Russia-associated risks, as well as providing
payment services and acting as a custodian for global
clients who hold Russia and Russia-associated
financial instruments.

The Firm increased its allowance for credit losses in
the first quarter due in part to client-specific
Russia and Russia-associated downgrades. However, the
Firm's exposure to Russia and Russia-associated
clients and counterparties is not material to its
financial condition or results of operations.

The Firm continues to assess the ongoing secondary
impacts of the war in Ukraine, including: increased
market volatility, effects on global energy and
commodities markets, client demand for credit and
liquidity, distress in certain industries or economic
sectors, heightened counterparty credit risk,
potential recessionary and inflationary pressures,
impacts on global supply chains and government
actions, including the imposition of financial and
economic sanctions.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 54-62,
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65, Market
Risk Management on pages 67-71 and Country Risk
Management on pages 72-73 for additional information.

Complying with global sanctions

The Firm has engaged and continues to engage with
government authorities, regulators, and industry
groups in connection with analyzing and implementing
procedures reasonably designed to comply with
financial and economic sanctions imposed on Russia and
Russia-associated entities and individuals by various
governments around the world.

Managing key operational risks

The Firm faces increased operational risk in its
efforts to comply with the various financial and
economic sanctions that have been imposed as a result
of the war in Ukraine, as the requirements are highly
complex and continue to evolve.

The Firm is also focused on risks related to the
increased potential for cyber attacks that may be
conducted in retaliation for the sanctions imposed.

Refer to Operational Risk Management on page 74 for
additional information.

Supporting employees

The Firm has provided additional benefits and support
to employees who have been affected by the war.

Providing humanitarian assistance

In support of the relief efforts, the Firm has made a
$10 million commitment to help address the Ukrainian
humanitarian crisis.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 9-33
of the JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, "Russia" refers to
exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for
which the largest proportion of their assets is
located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is
derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal
country risk management framework; "Russia-associated"
refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of
the Firm with respect to which economic or financial
sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been
imposed or which have close association with Russia.

JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue
to make progress with respect to the transition from
the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")
and other IBORs to comply with the International
Organization of Securities Commission's standards for
transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of
the publication of the principal tenors of the U.S.
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month,
six-month and 12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June
30, 2023.

The Firm continues to engage with and support clients
as they move to replacement rates. In connection with
the transition, as of March 31, 2022 the Firm had
remediated 96% of the notional amount of its bilateral
derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR by
virtue of counterparty adherence to, or the contracts
otherwise being subject to, the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association, Inc.'s ("ISDA") IBOR
Fallbacks Protocol, and continues its client outreach
with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans.

The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client,
industry, market, regulatory and legislative
developments. Refer to Business Developments on pages
50-51 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for

(a) Included operating lease income of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting: • lower equity underwriting fees
primarily driven by lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA, • lower debt underwriting fees
predominantly driven by high-yield bonds as a result of reduced issuances in a volatile market, partially offset by
• higher advisory fees benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Refer to C IB segment results on
pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue decreased largely in CIB,
reflecting: • a loss of $524 million in Credit Adjustments & Other, predominantly driven by funding spread
widening, and credit valuation adjustments related to increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of
derivative receivables from Russia-associated counterparties, • lower revenue in Equity Markets, particularly in
derivatives and Cash Equities, compared to a strong prior year, and • lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets,
particularly in Securitized Products largely due to the rising rate environment, which slowed down the pace of
mortgage production, predominantly offset by higher revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets on elevated client
activity in a volatile market. The decrease in Principal transactions revenue also reflects net losses on certain
legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 32-33, and Note 5 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of: • higher cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by
growth in transaction volume, and • higher deposit-related fees in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on
pages 19-21, pages 22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management,
administration and commissions revenue increased predominantly driven by: • strong cumulative net inflows into
long-term products, as well as higher performance fees, in AWM, and • higher net inflows and average market levels
in CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21, pages 29-31, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information. Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, compared with net gains in the prior year, associated with
repositioning the investment securities portfolios in both periods in Treasury and CIO. R efer to Corporate segment
results on pages 32-33 and Note 9 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to
lower production revenue from lower margins and volume, largely offset by higher net mortgage servicing revenue on
an increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven by changes in prepayment expectations. Refer to CCB
segment results on pages 19-21, Note 5 and 14 for additional information. Card income decreased due to higher
amortization related to new account origination costs in Card. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB seg ment results on pages
19-21, pages 22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively , and Note 5 for additional information. Other income in creased
reflecting: • net gains on equity investments in CIB, • proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and •
the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior year on certain renewable energy investments in
CIB, partially offset by • lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume, and • lower
net investment valuation gains in AWM.

Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from
PPP loans. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $275 billion, predominantly driven by
higher deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield was 1.86%, down 1 basis point (“bp”). The net
yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.67%, a decrease of 2 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 1.95%,
up 2 bps. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance
sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 165 for further details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a further discussion of Net interest yield excluding
Markets.

The provision for credit losses increased driven by: •
a net addition of $902 million to the allowance for
credit losses, consisting of $776 million in wholesale
and $127 million in consumer . The addition largely
reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on
the adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021,
due to the potential effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The
increase in the allowance also included client-
specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM, partially offset by • lower net charge-
offs of $475 million driven by Card, as consumer cash
balances remained elevated. The prior year included a
$5.2 billion net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses. Refer to CC B segment results on pages 19-21 ,

29-31, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65,

(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto
operating lease assets. (b) Included Firmwide legal
expense of $119 million and $28 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Compensation expense increased driven by investments
and higher structural expense across the LOBs,
partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation
in CIB. Noncompensation expense increased as a result
of: • higher structural expense, including
professional fees, • higher investments, including
technology expense across the LOBs and marketing
expense in CCB, • higher brokerage expense in CIB, as
well as other outside services expense, and • higher
legal expense predominantly in CIB, partially offset
by • lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower
auto lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle
collateral values. The prior year included a $550
million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.

The effective tax rate decreased driven by the lower
level of pre-tax income that also increased the
relative net impact of certain tax benefits and
expenses. The prior year included expenses related to
tax audit settlements.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of growth in deposits.
Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of
its excess cash with various central banks, including
the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements in creased driven by Markets,
reflecting:

• higher demand for securities to cover short
positions,

• higher collateral requirements, and

• the impact of client-driven market-making
activities.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets,
resulting from higher client-driven activities and an
increase in demand for securities to cover short
positions . Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities purchased under resale
agreements and securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased driven by Markets, due to:

• higher securities related to client-driven market-
making activities, and

• higher derivative receivables, largely commodities,
predominantly oil and gas, as a result of market
movements.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased resulting from net
purchases of securities, largely offset by paydowns,
and unrealized losses on AFS securities which are
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income
("AOCI"). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
32-33, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page
66, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans were relatively flat , and reflected:

• lower residential real estate loans at fair value in
Home Lending as sales outpaced originations due to
higher interest rates, and

• a decline in AWM due to paydowns and lower
securities-based lending,

offset by

• higher wholesale loans in CB and CIB.

The allowance for loan losses increased as a result of
a net addition of $806 million to the allowance for
credit losses, consisting of $677 million in wholesale
and $129 million in consumer . The addition largely
reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on
the adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021,
due to the potential effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The
increase in the allowance also included client-
specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM.

There was a $97 million addition to allowance for
lending-related commitments. This allowance is
included in other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 46-66, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more
detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for
loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due
to higher client receivables related to client-driven
activities in Markets, including prime brokerage,
during a period of heightened market volatility.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased,
reflecting higher MSRs driven by purchases and
originations, as well as the impact of changes in
market interest rates. Refer to Note 14 for additional
information.

Deposits increased in CIB, CCB and AWM, driven by:

• higher deposits in CIB's Payments and Securities
Services primarily driven by client activities, and

• growth in new and existing accounts in CCB across
consumer and small business customers,

partially offset by

• a decline in CB, principally due to seasonality.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased due to the
impact of client activities and higher secured
financing of trading assets in Markets. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and Note 10
for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher
net issuance of commercial paper primarily for short-
term liquidity management in Treasury and CIO . Refer
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 for
additional information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in
debt instruments, as well as higher derivative
payables associated with market movements. Refer to
Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
reflecting higher client payables related to client-
driven activities primarily in Markets, including
prime brokerage, during a period of heightened market
volatility. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
decreased driven by maturities of credit card
securitizations in Treasury and CIO . Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and Notes 13
and 22 for additional information on Firm-sponsored
VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by fair value hedge
accounting adjustments related to higher rates,
partially offset by net issuances in Treasury and CIO,
as well as a decline in the fair value of structured
notes in CIB . Refe r to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 41-45 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of a net
unrealized loss in AOCI, which was primarily driven by
the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and
cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to page 83
for information on changes in stockholders’ equity,
Capital actions on page 39, and Note 19 for additional

Operating activities • In 2022, cash used resulted from higher trading assets, and accrued interest and accounts
receivable, largely offset by higher accounts payable and other liabilities and trading liabilities. • In 2021,
cash used resulted from higher trading assets, accrued interest and accounts receivable, and securities borrowed,
partially offset by higher accounts payable and other liabilities and lower other assets. Investing activities • In
2022, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, net purchases of investment
securities, and higher net originations of loans. • In 2021, cash provided reflected lower securities purchased
under resale agreements and net proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment, partially
offset by net purchases of investment securities.

Financing activities • In 2022, cash provided reflected higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2021, cash provided reflected
higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and net proceeds from long- and short-
term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and
preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 12-13, Capital Risk Management on

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 80-84.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 15-16 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating
business segments may agree to share revenue from
those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in
the segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results
reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing ("FTP") is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to each
business segment and transfers the primary interest
rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO
within Corporate.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the
business segments.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each segment is
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions
and methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to
the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity
on page 38, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $694 million and $916 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for
allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised
to conform with the current presentation. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $109 million and $(115)
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Quarterly results Net income was $2.9 billion, down 57%, reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses
compared with a net benefit in the prior year. Net revenue was $12.2 billion, a decrease of 2%. Net interest income
was $8.3 billion, up 5%, driven by: • growth in deposits net of margin compression partially offset by lower PPP
loan forgiveness, in CBB, and • higher revolving loans in Card. Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, down 15%,
driven by: • lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending, • higher amortization related
to new account origination costs in Card, and • lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in
volume, partially offset by • higher net mortgage servicing revenue on an increase in MSR risk management results
primarily driven by changes in prepayment expectations, • higher asset management fees as a result of higher net
inflows and average market levels, and • higher deposit-related fees. Refer to Note 14 for further information
regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to
Note 5 for additional information on card income. Noninterest expense was $7.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting: •
investments in the business and increased structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and
marketing, partially offset by • lower volume- and revenue- related expenses primarily depreciation expense due to
lower auto lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral values. The provision for credit losses was
$678 million, reflecting: • net charge-offs of $553 million, down $470 million, driven by Card, as consumer cash
balances remained elevated, and • a $125 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in Home Lending. The
prior year included a $4.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Credit and Investment
Risk Management on pages 46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for a further discussion of the
credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and
insured by U.S. government agencies of $315 million
and $458 million, respectively. These amounts have
been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual
status as permitted by regulatory guidance. (b) At
March 31, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that
were under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer
Credit Portfolio on pages 49-53 for further
information on consumer payment assistance activity.

related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more
days past due, predominantly all of which were
considered collateral-dependent at time of exit. (c)

million of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and
guaranteed by the SBA. (d) Prior-period amount has

$15 million and $105 million in Card, respectively;
and (3) $45 million and $127 million in Auto,
respectively. Loans that are performing according to
their modified terms are generally not considered
delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on
pages 49-53 for further information on consumer
payment assistance activity. (g) At March 31, 2022 and
2021, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.
government agencies of $370 million and $557 million,

(a) Consists primarily of centrally managed credit
valuation adjustments (“CVA”), funding valuation
adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives, other valuation
adjustments, and certain components of fair value
option elected liabilities, which are primarily
reported in principal transactions revenue. Results
are presented net of associated hedging activities and
net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets. Quarterly results Net
income was $4.4 billion, down 26%. Net revenue was
$13.5 billion, down 7%. Banking revenue was $4.2
billion, down 6%. • Investment Banking revenue was
$2.1 billion, down 28%, driven by lower Investment
Banking fees, down 31%, reflecting lower equity and
debt underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. –
Equity underwriting fees were $249 million, down 76%,
primarily driven by lower issuance activity,
particularly in North America and EMEA. – Debt
underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 20%,
predominantly driven by high-yield bonds as a result
of reduced issuances in a volatile market. – Advisory
fees were $801 million, up 18%, benefiting from the
closing of deals announced in 2021. • Payments revenue
was $1.9 billion, up 33%, and included net gains on
equity investments. Excluding these net gains, revenue
was $1.5 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by
higher fees, deposits and improved deposit margins. •
Lending revenue was $321 million, up 21%,
predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of
accrual loans, compared to losses in the prior year.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.3
billion, down 8%. Markets revenue was $8.8 billion,
down 3%. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7
billion, down 1%, particularly in Securitized
Products, largely due to the rising rate environment,
which slowed down the pace of mortgage production,
predominantly offset by higher revenue in Currencies &
Emerging Markets on elevated client activity in a
volatile market.

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, down 7%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and Cash Equities,
compared to a strong prior year. • Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2%, driven by improved deposit
margins and growth in fees. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread
widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns
of derivative receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 3%,
driven by higher structural expense, investments in the business and legal expense, largely offset by lower volume-
and revenue-related expense including revenue-related compensation. The provision for credit losses of $445 million
was driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net benefit of $331 million in the
prior year. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
63-65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets may occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant
source of principal transactions revenue was the
amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

(a) Includes CB’s share of revenue from investment
banking products sold to CB clients through the CIB.
(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 17 for
discussion of revenue sharing. Quarterly results Net
income was $850 million, down 28%, largely driven by a
net increase in the provision for credit losses
compared with a net benefit in the prior year. Net
revenue was $2.4 billion, flat compared to the prior
year. Net interest income was $1.5 billion, up 4%,
driven by the impact of higher deposits. Noninterest
revenue was $867 million, down 5%, driven by lower
investment banking revenue, predominantly offset by
higher payments revenue. Noninterest expense was $1.1
billion, up 17%, largely driven by investments in the
business and higher volume- and revenue- related
expense, including compensation. The provision for
credit losses was $157 million, driven by a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared
with a net benefit of $118 million in the prior year.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
63-65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.0 billion, down 20%. Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up 6%. Net interest income
was $1.1 billion, up 16%. Noninterest revenue was $3.2 billion, up 3%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3
billion, up 6% driven by: • higher asset management fees, net of liquidity fee waivers, on strong cumulative net
inflows into long-term products, and higher performance fees, partially offset by • lower net investment valuation
gains. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.0 billion, up 6% driven by: • higher loans including the impact of
lower funding costs, and • growth in deposits, net of margin compression, partially offset by • lower brokerage
fees on reduced volume. Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 11% predominantly driven by higher structural
expense and investments in the business, largely driven by compensation, and higher volume- and revenue-related
expense, including distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was $154 million, driven by an addition to
the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net benefit of $121 million in the prior year. Refer to Credit and
Investment Risk Management on pages 46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for further discussions of
the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $58 million and $67
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) In the first quarter of 2022, the
Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-
period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Quarterly results Net loss was $856 million compared with a net loss of $852 million in the prior year. Net revenue
was a loss of $881 million, compared with a loss of $473 million in the prior year. Noninterest revenue decreased
primarily due to: • net losses on certain legacy private equity investments, compared with net gains in the prior
year, and • net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,
compared with net gains in the prior year, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios in
both periods, partially offset by • proceeds from an insurance settlement. Net interest income increased primarily
driven by higher rates, which resulted in slower prepayments. Noninterest expense of $184 million was down $691
million primarily driven by the absence of the contribution to the Firm's Foundation recorded in the prior year.
The current period tax benefit was predominantly driven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes. Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's International Consumer
activity, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager
in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the current quarter.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in
a manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors and protects the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide
structures for risk governance. The Firm follows a

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s
business activities and associated risks during normal
economic environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies ("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s
Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more
binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based
ratios. Refer to SLR on page 38 for additional
information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31,
2021, the CECL capital transition provisions , which
delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for
two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the
$2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of
December 31, 2021, will be phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2022, CET1
capital reflected the remaining 75%, or $2.2 billion,
benefit associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm
phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital
transition provisions recognized as of December 31,
2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
and total leverage exposure.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

PPP. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had $3.6 billion
of loans remaining under the PPP program, which
receive a zero percent risk weight under the federal
banking agencies’ regulatory capital rule. The Firm
does not expect to realize material credit losses on
PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating
the SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not
participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck
Protection Program Lending Facility, which would have
allowed the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”),
which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to
measure derivatives counterparty exposure under
Standardized approach RWA and Advanced approach RWA
where internal models are not used, as well as
leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the
regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the
U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to
Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations,
such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31,
2021, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm’s
Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion, a
decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1
capital ratio at March 31, 2022, and resulted in a
modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In
addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's
Advanced RWA at March 31, 2022, but to a lesser extent
than Standardized.
                                                        35

Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

RWA rollforward

The following table presents changes in the components of RWA under Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches
for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The amounts in the rollforward categories are estimates, based on the
predominant driver of the change. The increase in both Standardized and Advanced Market risk RWA at March 31, 2022
is largely due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for
a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk
Management. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an
amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet
their respective estimated total net cash outflows
over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of
eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that
is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with both the three month periods ended
December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021 primarily due to growth in deposits. The increase in excess liquidity in
JPMorgan Chase Bank,

N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average
LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a
result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities,
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $939 billion and $914 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.
The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets . The
Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount window at the
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $298 billion and
$308 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit
of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently
pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not
view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary
source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of
stable funding over a one-year horizon. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant
with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule. The Firm will
be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in 2023.

  Sources of funds                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the
Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-
bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured
borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce
the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.
A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are
consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,
which are both considered to be stable sources of
liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm. The table below
shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-
deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total
liabilities, as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end
deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits
increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting
inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the ongoing effect of certain government actions. In CCB, the increase
was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers. Refer
to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages
17-33 and pages 12-13, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2022,
compared with December 31, 2021, due to the impact of
client activities and higher secured financing of
trading assets in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in
commercial paper at March 31, 2022, from December 31,
2021, and for the average three months ended March 31,
2022 compared to the prior year period, was due to
higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity
management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at
March 31, 2022, from December 31, 2021, and for the
average three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to
the prior year period, was primarily due to higher
overdrafts in CIB.

Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding
provides an additional source of stable funding and
liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding
plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access
and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates
various funding markets, tenors and currencies in
creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The
significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank
subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to
external counterparties. The following table
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-
term debt.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of
a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements
for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral
agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2022, were as follows:

providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(l) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $179 million and $506 million, respectively,
of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $23.9 billion and $21.3 billion for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-
off/(recovery) rates.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. In the
first quarter of 2022, the COVID-19 consumer payment
deferral programs ended for new enrollments, except for
loans collateralized by residential real estate, as
that program remains in effect due to the U.S.
government's extension of its declaration of a national
emergency with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had approximately $825
million of retained consumer loans under payment
deferral programs, predominantly in residential real
estate. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment
deferral programs are current. During the first quarter
of 2022, there were approximately $385 million of new
enrollments in consumer payment deferral programs.

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,
2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair
value and auto and other loans, partially offset by
higher retained residential real estate loans.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage
loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
increased compared to December 31, 2021 in AWM, on
slower prepayments. Retained nonaccrual loans
decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved
credit performance . Net recoveries for t he three
months ended March 31, 2022 were higher when compared
with the same period in the prior year as the current
year benefited from the recovery on a loan sale as
well as further improvement in Home Price Index
("HPI"). Loans at fair value decreased from December
31, 2021, as sales outpaced originations in Home
Lending due to higher interest rates and lower loan
purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair
value increased from December 31, 2021 driven by CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $17.6 billion at March 31, 2022. This
amount included $5.9 billion of HELOCs that have
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments
or have been modified and $5.7 billion of interest-
only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after
2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their
revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn
line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are
exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit
risk profile. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
the carrying value of interest-only residential
mortgage loans were $32.1 billion and $30.0 billion,
respectively. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-
rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to
maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential
mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for
the three months ended March 31, 2022, in line with
the performance of the broader prime mortgage
portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

(a) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
nonaccrual loans included $2.8 billion and $2.7
billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers
were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information about loans modified in a TDR that are on

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists
of prime-quality scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased
when compared with December 31, 2021 due to a decrease
in business banking loans driven by PPP loan
forgiveness. Scored auto portfolio loans were
relatively flat as paydowns were offset by loan
originations. Net charge-offs for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 increased when compared to the
same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft
and scored auto charge-offs partially offset by lower
scored business banking charge-offs. The scored auto
portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.18% and 0.13%
for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Nonperforming assets The following table

1.04% and 0.50%, also reflecting the impact of
seasonality. Net charge-offs decreased for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 compared with the same
period in the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-
off rates continue to benefit from elevated consumer
cash balances.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

At March 31, 2022, the Firm had $901 million of credit
card loans outstanding that have been modified in
TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or
other insignificant modifications that are not
considered TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December
31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 for additional information
about loan modification programs to borrowers.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 56-59 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including
business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the
allowance for credit losses. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit continued to perform well with
charge-offs at historically low levels, however, nonperforming exposure increased driven by client-specific Russia
and Russia-associated downgrades. Refer to Business Developments on page 8 and Country Risk on pages 72-73 for
additional information. As of March 31, 2022, retained loans increased $9.6 billion driven by CIB and CB partially
offset by decreases in AWM. Lending-related commitments increased $10.8 billion, driven by net portfolio activity
in CIB. As of March 31, 2022, the net increase in nonperforming loans of $303 million was driven by client-specific
Russia and Russia-associated downgrades. Nonperforming derivatives increased $281 million largely driven by client-
specific downgrades in commodities.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2022,
may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $36.9 billion and $38.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
representing approximately 3.2% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in
criticized exposure was driven by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by client-
specific downgrades. The $36.9 billion of criticized exposure at March 31, 2022 was largely undrawn and $33.2
billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

shown in the table below. Criticized exposure decreased by $317 million from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021 to
$4.9 billion at March 31, 2022, driven by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio activity largely offset by
client-specific downgrades.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Since March 31, 2021,
nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $968 million,
largely in Oil & Gas and Consumer & Retail, with net
portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades being
largely offset by client-specific downgrades including
Russia and Russia-associated clients.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to
which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central
counterparty clearing house ("CCP"). Where possible,
the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 88% at both March 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional information
on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to
Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets were $73.6 billion and
$57.1 billion at March 31, 2022, and December 31,
2021, respectively. The increase was largely
commodities, predominantly oil and gas, as a result of
market movements. Derivative receivables represent the
fair value of the derivative contracts after giving
effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that may be used as security when the
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.

The benefits of these additional collateral amounts
for each counterparty are subject to a legally
enforceable master netting agreement and limited to
the net amount of the derivative receivables for each
counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer
to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use
of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance
for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the
allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in
accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
March 31, 2022 was $19.6 billion, an increase from
$18.7 billion at December 31, 2021, consisting of:
$776 million in wholesale, across the LOBs, and $127
million in consumer, driven by the residential real
estate portfolio. The change in the allowance largely
reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on
the adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021,
due to the potential effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The
increase in the allowance also included client-
specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is
estimated using a weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse
scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic
factors than the central case assumptions provided in
the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S.
unemployment rates above 4% through the second quarter
of 2023 and year over year growth in U.S. real GDP of
2.5% in the second quarter of 2023. The Firm’s central
case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and
U.S. real GDP as follows:

probable, modified PCD loans, and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to
be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider
any incremental penalty rates.

(b) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At March 31,
2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was
$677.5 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
32-33 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
67-71 for further information on the market risk
inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 41-45 for further information on
related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain
counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is
now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) During the period ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in
the nickel market resulted in elevated Average and Maximum Credit portfolio VaR.

(d) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components
and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

(e) Average and Maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were driven by a private equity position that became publicly
traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

Average total VaR increased by $26 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared with
December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by Credit
portfolio VaR, predominantly due to the effects of
nickel price increases and the associated volatility
in the nickel market, as well as increased volatility
in fixed income and commodities impacting CIB trading
VaR.

Average total VaR was $63 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, reflecting the effects of nickel
price increases and the associated volatility in the
nickel market impacting Credit portfolio VaR, as well
as increased volatility in fixed income and
commodities impacting CIB trading VaR. Average total
VaR decreased by $43 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, compared with the same period in
the prior year. This decrease was driven by volatility
which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
rolling out of the one-year historical look-back
period in the first half of 2021, predominantly
impacting exposures in fixed income and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR
for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in
March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related
counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on
average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 141 of the 261 days, and observed 23
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 43 of
the 64 days, and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended March 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt
and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the
table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying
positions included in earnings-at-risk. One way the
Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest
rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a
baseline, which includes net interest income and
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline
uses market interest rates and in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in
U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include
retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,
investment securities, long-term debt and any related
interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk
scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and
scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the
reversal of Quantitative Easing. • The pricing
sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,
represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could
change upon a given change in market interest rates.
The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from
actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-
risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the
Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 7
for additional information). The Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities are presented in the table below.

updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher rates as
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance
sheet. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to
the parallel and long-term shift in rates is primarily
the result of a greater impact from assets repricing
compared to the impact of liabilities repricing, while
the shift in short-term rates is primarily the result
of a greater impact from liabilities repricing
compared to the impact of assets repricing. The Firm’s

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain
counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is
now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be
exposed to country risk resulting from financial,
economic, political or other significant developments
which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s
exposures related to a particular country or set of
countries. The Country Risk Management group actively
monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted
by these developments and measures the extent to which
the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s
strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

  Sources and measurement                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its
lending and deposits, investing, and market-making
activities, whether cross-border or locally funded.
Country exposure includes activity with both
government and private-sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual
country is based on the country where the largest
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest
proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be
different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or
country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of
the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero
recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or
guarantors attributed to that country. Activities
which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a
country are not included in the country exposure
measure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or
secondary exposure to collateral on securities
financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure,
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or
index products, or where the nature of the
counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not
suitable for attribution to an individual country. The
use of different measurement approaches or assumptions
could affect the amount of reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement
framework:

• Lending exposures are measured at the total
committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the
allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and
marketable securities collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed
with central and commercial banks

• Securities financing exposures are measured at their
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral
received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair
value of all positions, including both long and short
positions

• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the
fair value of the eligible collateral received

• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for
the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the
fair value of the derivative receivable or payable;
reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these
exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs
from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank
regulatory requirements.

Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March
31, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s
largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and
does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may
fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to Germany and
the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of
those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities. As of March 31, 2022, exposure to
Russia, based on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework, was approximately $650 million. This
largely reflects cross-border lending activity, net of the allowance for credit losses, to Russian corporate
clients.

  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                               
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes
or systems, human factors, or external events
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational
Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest
itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control),
cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure
to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations
or failure of vendors or other third party providers
to perform in accordance with their agreements.
Operational Risk Management attempts to manage
operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the
Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its
businesses, and the markets and regulatory
environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on
other select examples of operational risks are
provided below.

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions
have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated
entities and individuals by various governments around
the world, including the authorities in the U.S., the
U.K. and the EU. These sanctions are complex and
evolving at a rapid pace in response to the war. The
Firm faces increased operational risk associated with
interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance
programs. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has
implemented additional controls reasonably designed to
mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent
dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject
to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments
as required by the applicable regulations.

Business and technology resiliency risk

Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide
Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the
Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover
from business disruptions including occurrence of an
extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact
critical business functions and supporting assets
(i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third
parties). The program includes governance, awareness
training, planning and testing of recovery strategies,
as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to
identify, assess, and manage business interruption and
public safety risks.

Cybersecurity Risk

The Firm faces increased risk of cyber attacks due to
potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a
result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm has implemented
additional precautionary measures and controls
reasonably designed to address this increased risk,
such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no
assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to
protect against cybersecurity breaches will provide
absolute security against cyber attacks.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-65
and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that
are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with
modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a
subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and
geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,
corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real
estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.5% higher

over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of

approximately 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022;
lower

U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly

3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,
with a

peak difference of approximately 7.0% in the fourth

quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak

difference of 20.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including:

• The Firm increased the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in estimating the allowance for credit
losses as of March 31, 2022, and accordingly, the
existing allowance reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables.

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio
composition and borrower behavior can significantly
affect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate
the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2022, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses, the comparison between these two
scenarios for the lending exposures below reflect the
following differences: • An increase of approximately
$600 million for residential real estate loans and
lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $2.4 billion for credit card loans • An
increase of approximately $2.8 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,
particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and
that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March
31, 2022.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including, derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including the war in Ukraine;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyberattacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems;

• Economic, financial, reputational and other impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”),
a financial holding company incorporated under
Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services
firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The
Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial
services for consumers and small businesses,
commercial banking, financial transaction processing
and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s business segments. The
accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines
prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in
conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense,
and the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could be different from
these estimates. In the opinion of management, all
normal, recurring adjustments have been included such
that this interim financial information is fairly
stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related
notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have
been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation.

Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other
entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for
clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm
are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included
on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm
determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the
entity is a voting interest entity or a variable
interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative
receivables and derivative payables with the same
counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable
master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities financing activities to be
presented on a net basis when specified conditions are
met, including the existence of a legally enforceable
master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net
such balances where it has determined that the
specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

(a) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 72.8billion and $
73.9billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        88                                                         
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 845million and $ 801million, respectively. Included in these balances at March
31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $ 45million and $ 51million, respectively, and other assets
of $ 800million and $ 750million, respectively.

(e) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $ 15.1billion and $ 26.2billion, respectively, of
residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 9.3billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien
mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.
GSEs and government agencies of $ 5.0billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 286million, nonagency securities of $ 10million and
non-trading loans of $ 987million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 10million, trading loans of $ 40million and non-trading loans of $
345million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 1.0billion and non-trading loans of $ 740million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $ 850million including $ 187million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to
Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
When a determination is made to classify a financial
instrument within level 3, the determination is based
on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the
overall fair value measurement. However, level 3
financial instruments typically include, in addition
to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable
components (that is, components that are actively
quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below
include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3
assets since December 31, 2021, for those items
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis on page 95 for further information
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Three months ended March 31, 2022
Level 3 assets were $ 22.0billion at March 31, 2022,
reflecting an increase of $ 4.5billion from December
31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 was largely driven by: • $ 1.0billion
increase in gross interest rate derivative receivables
due to gains. • $ 1.8billion increase in MSRs. Refer
to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Refer to the
sections below for additional information. Transfers
between levels for instruments carried at fair value
on a recurring basis For the three months ended March
31, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into
level 3 included the following: • $ 1.2billion of
total debt and equity instruments, largely due to
equity securities of $ 853million driven by a decrease
in observability as a result of restricted access to
certain markets. For the three months ended March 31,
2022, there were no significant transfers from level 3
into level 2. For the three months ended March 31,
2021, there were no significant transfers from level 2
into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. All
transfers are based on changes in the observability
and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are
assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly
reporting period in which they occur.

Gains and losses The following describes significant
components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses)
for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
rollforward tables on pages 91-94 for further
information on these instruments. Three months ended
March 31, 2022 • $ 2.0billion of net gains on assets,
predominantly driven by gains in net equity derivative
receivables due to market movements and MSRs
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. •
$ 2.2billion of net gains on liabilities, largely
driven by gains in long-term debt due to market
movements. Three months ended March 31, 2021 • $
984million of net gains on assets, driven by MSRs
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. •
$ 528million of net gains on liabilities, largely
driven by market movements in long-term debt. Refer to
Note 14 for additional information on MSRs.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives

The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any

from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 51% with a weighted average of 24%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.
(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.
The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 171 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial
assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and
loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair
value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in
the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were $( 8) million and $( 2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.
(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.
(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2022, and December 31,
2021, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 11.7billion and $ 11.9billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $
56million and $ 10million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
111 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        103                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

31, 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were
recorded in net interest income.
(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of
income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest
rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(g) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 24.9billion and $ 25.7billion at March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 14.6billion and $ 14.0billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 1.4billion and $ 10.8billion, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional
information.
(d) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net
interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair
value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and
losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $ 139million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI
at March 31, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in
earnings is approximately eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.
For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.
The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 9.8billion and $ 2.2billion, at March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are
used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be
prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately 7years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency residential collateralized
mortgage obligations and 5years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and
net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where
other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the
balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm
exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the
counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such
collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under
U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and
reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities
financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the
lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as
collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to
return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $ 415million and $ 440million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a
sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.
The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business
banking and auto dealer loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal
investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global
Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows:
current included $ 30million and $ 35million; 30–149 days past due included $ 13million and $ 11million; and 150 or
more days past due included $ 22million and $ 20million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
(b) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.
(c) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.
government agencies of $ 35million and $ 31million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts
have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2022,
approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million for both the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies.
Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement
rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these balances
were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were noloans that were not
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2022.

(k) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $
65million and $ 66million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented
based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new
TDRs was $ 118million and $ 251million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were
no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.
Nature and extent of modifications The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs,
including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but
not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest
payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table
provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation
programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole
concession granted is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are
not considered concessions.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently
modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than
one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on
permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the
definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in
modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about
redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the
financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial
modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt
and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and
for which the payment default occurred within one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real
estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or
another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not
be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At March 31, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently
modified in TDRs were 5years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both
voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by
U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 767million and $ 619million, respectively, that were not
included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $ 179million and $ 506million, respectively,
of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $ 163million and $ 35million,
respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal
balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the
guidelines set by the SBA. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past due
and still accruing interest at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2022.

Loan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new
TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Additional commitments to
lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not
material.

Loan modifications The Firm may offer loan
modification programs granting concessions to credit
card borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the
cardholder does not comply with the modified payment
terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and
will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the
Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit
card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the
periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit
card loans.

a payment default in the periods presented, and for
which the payment default occurred within one yearof
the modification. The amounts presented represent the
balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in
which they defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment
default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower
misses twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted
modified credit card loans remain in the modification
program and continue to be charged off in accordance
with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for
retained wholesale loans.

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan
does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there
have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021.
Loan modifications

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs. New TDRs were $ 418million and $ 428million as of March 31, 2022, and 2021,
respectively. New TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates,
covenant waivers and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan predominantly in the Commercial and
Industrial loan class. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

The carrying value of TDRs was $ 906million and $ 607million as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively.

  Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Refer to
Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a
detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses
and the related accounting policies.

(a) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed
probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to
be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider
any incremental penalty rates.
(b) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, lending-related commitments excluded $ 15.3billion and $ 21.8billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 757.3billion and $ 674.4billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 32.9billion and $ 39.6billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance
for credit losses as of March 31, 2022 was $
19.6billion, an increase from $ 18.7billion at
December 31, 2021, consisting of: $ 776million in
wholesale, across the LOBs, and $ 127million in
consumer, driven by the residential real estate
portfolio. The change in the allowance largely
reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on
the adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021,
due to the potential effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The
increase in the allowance also included client-
specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is
estimated using a weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse
scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic
factors than the central case assumptions provided in
the table below, resulting in weighted average U.S.
unemployment rates above 4% through the second quarter
of 2023 and year over year growth in U.S. real GDP of
2.5% in the second quarter of 2023.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

discussion of VIEs, including the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations.
The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm
considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the
structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial
instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed
commercial paper conduit.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        139                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of
business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 13.3billion and
$ 13.7billion of the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31,
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 13.8billion and $ 13.4billion at
March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively,
and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend
credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option
bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance
their municipal bond investments at short-term rates.
TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and
non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor
for all non-customer TOB transactions.

item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of
these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in
beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.9billion and $ 2.6billion at March 31,
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
26.5billion and $ 26.8billion, of which $ 9.0billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at March 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts
of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        142                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 7.2billion
and $ 6.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021
was $ 10.3billion and $ 10.5billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety
of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, and commercial mortgages.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government agencies under certain arrangements. The
Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans
from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage
the foreclosure process in accordance with the
applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be
insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase
option becomes exercisable, such loans must be
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan
with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for
additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these loans
and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2022, the
Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual business
results and projections of business performance. Based
on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill
was not impaired as of March 31, 2022, or December 31,
2021, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment
during the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

(b) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(c) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as
defined below.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were
subject as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

CECL regulatory capital transition

On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition
provisions , which delayed the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning
January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit
recognized as of December 31, 2021, will be phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March
31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining 75%, or
$ 2.2billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital
transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm
phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital
transition provisions recognized as of December 31,
2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
and total leverage exposure.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31,
2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a
contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.
If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for
the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.
                                                        157                                                        
Loan sales- and securitization-related
indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s
mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with
GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties
that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and
that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans
and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such
representations and warranties are breached by the
Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands
associated with private label securitizations is
separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form
10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for additional information regarding litigation.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house therefore the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 156. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 156 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged
assets.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.
The following table presents the fair value of
collateral accepted.

Contingencies

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially
millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal
proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at
varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and
several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.4billion at March 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the
Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not
believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,
including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about
the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be
incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into
account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual
losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Amrapali
. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with
investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential
housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims
against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver
residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In
August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm
is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the
offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act
(“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from
J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated
an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil
companies. The account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights
to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the
account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal
Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments
made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were
instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for
summary judgment and was unsuccessful. A trial was held between February and April 2022, and the parties are
awaiting the Court's decision. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported
settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading
activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty
to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year
                                                        159                                                        
exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified
Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January
2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-
yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a
South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged
conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX
futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded
from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in
November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against
the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at
allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange
dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by
the Firm and 11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related
individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,
including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending before the
U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the tribunal has denied a request by the proposed class representatives for class
certification on an opt-out basis. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In December 2021 certain of the
Firm’s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective civil investigations of compliance with
records preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants.
The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain communications required
to be maintained under their respective record keeping rules, where such communications were sent or received by
employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC
resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC
also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125million
civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities plc paid a total $ 75million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to
requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records
preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that
have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. In March 2022, a shareholder
derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the
Firm’s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws based on
the Board’s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation requirements.
The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. Interchange Litigation.
Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and
Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and
enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash
payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules.
In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an
agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants
collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow
from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District
Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification
in part, and denied the motion in part. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising
similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded
to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the
                                                        160                                                        
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s ("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an
infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of
litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification
of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A
consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark
Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting
antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S.
dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants
moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary
injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that
rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the
Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference
Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related
Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations
relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and
related conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in
which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud
and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations
as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years,
provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all
of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A
portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action
complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the
Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in
violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or
practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class
actions, and, in December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among the parties. In addition,
several putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of
Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in
December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to
commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to precious metals.
In October 2020, twoputative class action complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual
defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC
filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating
to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021.
Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in
precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the putative class period were
materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation .
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic
Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York
State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading
for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
                                                        161                                                        
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this
action, which defendants are opposing. * * * In
addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named
as defendants or are otherwise involved in a
substantial number of other legal proceedings. The
Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the
claims asserted against it in its currently
outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend
itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be
initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm
has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance
with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies,
the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability
when it is probable that such a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation
reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 119million and
$ 28million for the three months ended March 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the
Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be
adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent
difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal
proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the
matters present novel legal theories, involve a large
number of parties or are in early stages of discovery,
the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the
eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters,
the timing of their ultimate resolution or the
eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences
related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes,
based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the
material legal proceedings described above and after
taking into account its current litigation reserves
and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,
that the other legal proceedings currently pending
against it should not have a material adverse effect
on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The
Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is
no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have
material reputational consequences. As a result, the
outcome of a particular matter may be material to
JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular
period, depending on, among other factors, the size of
the loss or liability imposed and the level of
JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically,
the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to
the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
                                                                                                                   
  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and March 31,
2021 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
including the related notes (collectively referred to
as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our
reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 22, 2022, which
included a paragraph describing a change in the manner
of accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In
our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as
of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower
is experiencing financial difficulty, including when
foreclosure is deemed probable based on borrower
delinquency.

Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment
services to corporate and public sector clients
worldwide through the commercial card products.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)
which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to
transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

derivative contract. The determination as to whether a
credit event has occurred is generally made by the
relevant International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational
considerations as defined in the LCR rule.

Eligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain
eligibility criteria

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

the appraised value of the collateral (i.e.,
residential real estate) securing the loan.
                                                                                                                   
  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio considering all available lien
positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to
present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Management also uses this financial measure at the
segment level, because it believes this provides

particular business segment and facilitates a
comparison of the business segment with the
performance of competitors.

Markets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets businesses.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions
governed by that agreement to be terminated or
accelerated and settled through a single payment in a

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.
                                                        168                                                        
Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSR : Mortgage servicing rights

NA : Data is not applicable or available for the
period presented.

Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average
retained loans for the reporting period.

Net interchange income includes the following
components:

• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit
card issuers on sales transactions.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points
earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

OCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

OCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)

Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association ("SBA")

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in
                                                        169                                                        
client-driven market-making activities and on private
equity investments. In connection with its client-
driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in
debt and equity instruments, derivatives and
commodities (including physical commodities
inventories and financial instruments that reference
commodities). Principal transactions revenue also
includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain
derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in
products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of
ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a
viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its
shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track
record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is
to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.

foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment
rates, underlying reference pool of loans or other
market variables. The notes typically contain embedded
(but not separable or detachable) derivatives.
Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or
both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life
of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-
traditional uses of traditional interest rates or
indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but
are currently on hold, which could be due to
bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial
and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed
results, the total net revenue for each of the
business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-
equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities; the corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income
tax expense.

TDR : “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur
when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan
agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that
is experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with
short-term and other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

Freddie Mac which are U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). In general, obligations of
U.S. government agencies are fully and explicitly
guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and
interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government in the event of a default.

U.S. GSE(s) : “U.S. government-sponsored enterprises”
are quasi-governmental, privately-held entities
established or chartered by the U.S. government to
serve public purposes as specified by the U.S.
Congress to improve the flow of credit to specific
sectors of the economy and provide certain essential
services to the public. U.S. GSEs include Fannie Mae

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds.
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating
and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a
fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings,
the assigned peer
                                                        173                                                        
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable,
the fund rating providers redenominate asset values
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a
“primary share class” level to represent the quartile
ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and
at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had
been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
