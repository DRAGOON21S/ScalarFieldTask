  Firmwide overview                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
For the third quarter of 2022, JPMorgan Chase reported
net income of $9.7 billion, down 17%, earnings per
share of $3.12, an ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 18%.

Total net revenue was up 10%, and reflected:

• Net interest income of $17.5 billion, up 34%, driven
by higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets net
interest income. Net interest income excluding Markets
was $16.9 billion, up 51%.

• Noninterest revenue was $15.2 billion, down 8%,
driven by

– lower Investment Banking fees,

– $959 million of net investment securities losses in
Corporate, and

– lower net production revenue in Home Lending,

largely offset by

– higher CIB Markets revenue.

Noninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 12%, driven
by higher structural expense and continued investments
in the business, including compensation, technology
and marketing.

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion,
reflecting:

• a net addition of $808 million to the allowance for
credit losses, consisting of a net addition of $937
million in wholesale, driven by loan growth and
lending-related commitment activity, as well as the
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios, partially offset by a net reduction of $143
million in consumer, driven by Home Lending, and

• $727 million of net charge-offs, up $203 million,
predominantly driven by CCB.
                                                         5                                                         
The prior year provision was a net benefit of $1.5
billion, reflecting a net reduction in the allowance
for credit losses of $2.1 billion and net charge-offs
of $524 million.

The total allowance for credit losses was $20.8
billion at September 30, 2022. The Firm had an
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage
ratio of 1.70%, compared with 1.86% in the prior year.

The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion
at September 30, 2022, a net decrease of $1.6 billion
from the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans,
reflecting loan sales and improved credit performance
in consumer, and paydowns in wholesale.

Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 7%,
driven by higher loans across the lines of business.

Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 3%,
reflecting an increase in CCB driven by growth from
new and existing accounts across both consumer and
small busines s customers, and growth in time deposits
in AWM, partially offset by declines in both Payments
and Securities Services in CIB and in non-operating
deposits in CB.

The Firm’s CET1 capital was $210 billion, and the
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.5% and
13.0%, respectively.

The Firm’s SLR was 5.3%.

The Firm's TBVPS was $69.90, relatively flat versus
the prior year.

As of September 30, 2022, the Firm had average
eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of
approximately $716 billion and unencumbered marketable
securities with a fair value of approximately $771
billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 89 and page 155 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of certain of those
risks and uncertainties and the other factors that
could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ
materially because of those risks and uncertainties.
There is no assurance that actual results will be in
line with the outlook information set forth below, and
the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-
looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the fourth
quarter of 2022 and full-year 2022 should be viewed
against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies,
financial markets activity, the geopolitical
environment, the competitive environment, client and
customer activity levels, and regulatory and
legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.
                                                                                                                   
  Fourth quarter and full-year 2022                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Management expects net interest income to be
approximately $19 billion in the fourth quarter of
2022, which would result in approximately $66 billion
for full-year 2022, market dependent.

Management expects net interest income excluding
Markets to also be approximately $19 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2022, with Markets NII expected to
be around zero, which would result in approximately
$61.5 billion for full-year 2022, market dependent.

Management expects full-year 2022 adjusted expense to
be approximately $77 billion, which includes increased
investments in technology, distribution and marketing,
and higher structural expense.

Management expects the full-year 2022 net charge-off
rate in Card to be approximately 1.5%.

expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to

  War in Ukraine                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in
Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken steps to
close positions and reduce exposures connected with
the war, and continues to assist clients with
fulfilling or terminating pre-existing obligations and
managing their Russia-related risks.

The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated
clients and counterparties is not material to its
financial condition or results of operations. However,
the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine, including
increased market volatility, inflationary pressures
and the effects of financial and economic sanctions
imposed by various governments, could have adverse
effects on the Firm’s businesses.

The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the
operational risks associated with the war, including
compliance with the financial and economic sanctions
and the increased risk of cyber attacks.

Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75, Market
Risk Management on pages 77-81, Country Risk
Management on pages 82-83 and Operational Risk
Management on page 84 for additional information.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, “Russia” refers to
exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for
which the largest proportion of their assets is
located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is
derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal
country risk management framework; and “Russia-
associated” refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which
economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in
Ukraine have been imposed or which have close
association with Russia.

JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue
to make progress with respect to the transition from
the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
and other IBORs to comply with the International
Organization of Securities Commission's standards for
transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of
the publication of the principal tenors of the U.S.
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month,
six-month and 12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June
30, 2023.

The Firm continues its client outreach with respect to
U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans and continues to

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile
market conditions continued to have a negative impact
on issuance activity, and

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of
announced deals.

Refer to C IB segment results on pages 28-33 and Note
5 for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased primarily in
CIB, reflecting:

• higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, as elevated
volatility drove a strong performance in the macro
businesses, particularly Rates and Currencies &
Emerging Markets, and

• higher revenue associated with Derivatives in Equity
Markets.

Credit Ad justments & Other was a loss of $31 million
, compared with a gain of $108 million in the prior
year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain
cases have offsets across other revenue lines,
including net interest income. The Firm assesses the
performance of its CIB Markets business on a total
revenue basis.

Refer to CIB results on pages 28-33, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a
result of lower cash management fees on higher credits
earned by clients, in CB and CIB. Refer to CIB and CB
segment results on pages 28-33, pages 34-37 and Note 5
for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue decreased, reflecting:

• lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from
lower average market levels, largely offset by the
removal of most money market fund fee waivers,

• lower brokerage commissions largely in AWM
reflecting reduced volumes, and

• lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets
under custody reflecting lower market levels,

partially offset by

• higher travel-related commissions in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages
23-27, pages 28-33 and pages 38-41 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses o n sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS
and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO.
R efer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43 and
Note 9 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and
volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net
gain in MSR risk management, compared with a net loss
in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27 and Notes
5 and 14 for additional information.

Card income increased, reflecting higher revenue on
volume growth in commercial card and merchant
processing in CIB and CB.

Card income in CCB was relatively flat as the impact
from the increase in debit and credit card sales
volume was offset by higher amortization related to
new account origination costs. Refer to CCB, CIB and
CB segment results on pages 23-27, pages 28-33 and
pages 34-37 and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income de creased reflecting:

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result
of a decline in volume, and

• net losses on equity investments in CIB, compared
with a gain in the prior year ,

partially offset by

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO,
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar.

Refer to Note 4 for additional information on net
investment hedges.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates ,
partially offset by lower Markets NII.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, up $125 billion, and the yield was 3.05%, up
125 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.09%, an increase of 47
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 2.81%, up 90
bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 182 for further

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile

and

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of

Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting:

• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven
by a strong performance in the macro businesses,
particularly Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates,
partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized
Products and Credit, and

• higher revenue associated with Derivatives and Prime
Brokerage in Equity Markets,

largely offset by

• a loss of $773 million in Credit Adjustments & Other
in CIB, compared with a gain of $338 million in the
prior year. The loss in the current year reflected
funding spread widening and, to a lesser extent,
losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia
and Russia-associated counterparties,

• net markdowns predominantly recorded in the second
quarter of 2022 on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing
portfolio in CIB and CB,

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in
the prior year, and

• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash
deployment transactions, which were more than offset
by the related net interest income earned on these
transactions.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to
higher service fee volume in CCB. Refer to CCB segment
results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional
information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased, predominantly driven by:

• higher travel-related commissions in CCB,

• higher asset managem ent fees, including in AWM due
to the removal of most money market fund fee waivers
and net inflows, largely offset by lower market levels
and

• higher annuity sales in CCB,

partially offset by

• lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets
under custody reflecting lower market levels.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS
and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and
volume,

largely offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue resulting from

– a net gain in MSR risk management, compared with a
net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model
inputs, and

– higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-
party loans serviced.

Card income decreased due to higher amortization
related to new account origination costs in Card,
partially offset by higher revenue on volume growth in
commercial card and merchant processing in CIB and CB.

Other income de creased reflecting:

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result
of a decline in volume ,

• net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM,
compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first
quarter of 2022 in Corporate ,

• higher net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments,

• a gain on an equity-method investment received in
partial satisfaction of a loan in CB, and

• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded
in the prior year on certain renewable energy
investments in CIB.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates
and balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower
Markets NII, as well as lower NII from PPP loans.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4
trillion, up $203 billion, and the yield was 2.38%, up
56 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.85%, an increase of 21
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 2.34%, up 42

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion,
reflecting a net addition of $808 million to the
allowance for credit losses and $727 million of net
charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses consisted of:

• $937 million in wholesale, driven by loan growth and
lending-related commitment activity, as well as the
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios,

partially offset by

• a net reduction of $143 million in consumer, driven
by Home Lending.

The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the
addition to the allowance resulting from higher
outstanding balances was offset by a reduction related
to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede.

Net charge-offs increased $203 million, predominantly
driven by CCB.

The prior year included a $2.1 billion net red uction
in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs
of $524 million.

The provision for credit losses was $4.1 billion,
reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion to the
allowance for credit losses and $2.0 billion of net
charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses consisted of:

• $1.9 billion in wholesale, driven by

– loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast,
including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios
and the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022;

• $168 million in consumer, primarily driven by Card,
reflecting higher outstanding balances, predominantly
offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede.

Net charge-offs decreased $349 million driven by Card,
reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S.
consumers. However, median deposit balances continue
to decline, impacted by the growth in consumer
spending.

Th e prior year included a $10.3 billion net reduction
in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs
of $2.3 billion.

Compensation expense increased driven by higher
structural expense and investments in the business, as
well as higher revenue-related expense in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher investments in the business, including
marketing in CCB, and technology, and

• higher structural expense, including travel and
entertainment and regulatory assessments,

partially offset by

• lower volume-related expense, primarily depreciation
expense in CCB on lower auto lease assets.

auto lease assets, partially offset by higher
operating losses.

The prior year included a $550 million contribution to
the Firm's Foundation.

The effective tax rate increased and reflects the
absence of an income tax benefit in the prior year
related to the Firm's 2020 U.S federal tax return,
largely offset by benefits related to tax audit
settlements and changes in the level and mix of income
and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local
taxes in the current year.

The effective tax rate was relatively flat compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as benefits
from tax audit settlements in the current year were
offset by the absence of an income tax benefit in the
prior year related to the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax
return.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits and
loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s
placement of its excess cash with various central
banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements in creased driven by Markets,
reflecting:

• the impact of netting on client-driven market-making
activities and collateral requirements, as well as

• higher demand for securities to cover short
positions .

Securities borrowed de creased driven by Markets,
reflecting lower client-driven activities, partially
offset by higher demand for securities to cover short
positions .

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased driven by:

• higher derivative receivables, primarily foreign
exchange and commodities as a result of market
movements, as well as higher levels of debt
instruments related to client-driven market-making
activities in Fixed Income Markets, and

• higher deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities reflects the transfer of $73.2
billion of securities from the available-for-sale
(“AFS”) portfolio to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
portfolio in the second quarter of 2022.

• The decrease in AFS securities was also due to
paydowns, as well as unrealized losses, which are
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (
“ AOCI ” ),

largely offset by net purchases

• T he increase in HTM was also due to purchases,
partially offset by paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 76, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans increased , reflecting:

• higher originations and revolver utilization in CB,

• higher balances in Card driven by growth in
revolving balances on higher consumer spending and net
new originations, and

• higher wholesale loans in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as
sales outpaced originations due to higher interest
rates, and

• the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in CBB.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a
net addition of $1.8 billion to the allowance for loan
losses, consisting of:

• $1.6 billion in wholesale , resulting from

– loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast,
including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios
and the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and

• $204 million in consumer driven by Card, reflecting
higher outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a
reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in
uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the
                                                        16                                                         
effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

There was also a $290 million addition to the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 57-76, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more
detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for
loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased
predominantly due to higher client receivables related
to client-driven activities in Markets, including
prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased,
reflecting:

• higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest
rates and net additions, partially offset by the
realization of expected cash flows, and

• additions to goodwill associated with the
acquisitions of Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in
the third quarter of 2022, and Frosch Travel Group,
LLC and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in the second quarter
of 2022.

Deposits decreased reflecting:

• a reduction in non-operating deposits in CB, and in
AWM net outflows into investments as a result of the
rising interest rate environment,

partially offset by

• growth from new consumer and small business accounts
in CCB that more than offset the decline in deposits
in existing accounts as spending continued to grow ,
and

• an increase in Corporate driven by the Firm's
international consumer growth initiatives.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased due to:

• higher secured financing of trading assets and the
impact of netting on client-driven market-making
activities in Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities
in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 51-56 and Note 10 for additional
information.

Short-term borrowings decreased as a result of lower
financing requirements in Markets. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 51-56 for additional
information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities, which resulted in higher
levels of short positions in debt instruments, as well
as higher derivative payables as a result of market
movements in Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
predominantly due to higher client payables related to
client-driven activities primarily in Markets,
including prime brokerage.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by higher levels of Firm-administered
multi-seller conduit commercial paper issued to third
parties. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
51-56 and Notes 13 and 22 for add itional information,
specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by:

• a decline in the fair value of structured notes in
Markets, and fair value hedge accounting adjustments
in Treasury and CIO related to higher rates,

largely offset by

• net issuances in Markets and Treasury and CIO .

Refe r to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for
additional information.

Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of net
unrealized losses in AOCI, which were predominantly
driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS
portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO.

stockholders’ equity on page 93, and Note 19 for a

Operating activities • In 2022, cash provided reflected higher accounts payable and other liabilities, trading
liabilities, and net proceeds from loans held-for-sale, predominantly offset by higher trading assets. • In 2021,
cash used resulted from higher securities borrowed and accrued interest and accounts receivable, partially offset
by higher accounts payable and other liabilities. Investing activities • In 2022, cash used resulted from net loan
originations and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds of
investment securities. • In 2021, cash used resulted from net loan originations and net purchases of investment
securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements.

Financing activities • In 2022, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, largely offset by lower deposits. • In 2021, cash
provided reflected higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and net proceeds from
long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash
dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 16-17,

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 90-94.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 19-20 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating
business segments may agree to share revenue from
those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in
the segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results
reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the
segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital
are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated
to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business
equity on page 48, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on capital
allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of those methodologies.

(b) Effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, Consumer & Business Banking was renamed Banking & Wealth Management.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $54 million and $(145) million for the three months ended September 30,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and $191 million and $(363) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and

(d) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Net income was $4.3 billion, relatively flat compared
to the prior year.

Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 14%.

Net interest income was $10.6 billion, up 26%, driven
by:

• higher margins and growth in deposits in CBB, and
higher revolving loans in Card,

partially offset by

• a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in
CBB and lower NII in Home Lending predominantly due to
tighter loan spreads.

Noninterest revenue was $3.8 billion, down 9%, driven
by:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and
volume in Home Lending, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a
decline in volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net
gain in MSR risk management compared with a net loss
in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs,

• higher travel-related commissions,

• a gain on warrants associated with an equity
investment, and

• card income was relatively flat as the impact from
the increase in debit and credit card sales volume was
offset by higher amortization related to new account
origination costs.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding
changes in the value of the MSR asset and related
hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to
Note 5 for additional information on card income.

Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, up 11%,
reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation,
marketing and technology,

partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses driven by
lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $529 million,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $679 million, up $188 million,
largely driven by loan growth in Card,

partially offset by

• a $150 million reserve release in Home Lending.

The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the
addition to the allowance resulting from higher
outstanding balances was offset by a reduction related
to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede.

The prior year included a $950 million reduction in
the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
73-75 for a further discussion of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $10.3 billion, down 38%, predominantly
driven by a net increase in the provision for credit
losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $39.2 billion, an increase of 4%.

Net interest income was $27.6 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by:

• growth in deposits and higher margins in CBB, and
higher revolving loans in Card,

partially offset by

• a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in
CBB, and lower NII in Home Lending driven by tighter
loan spreads.

Noninterest revenue was $11.6 billion, down 14%,
driven by:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and
volume in Home Lending,

• lower card income reflecting higher amortization
related to new account origination costs, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a
decline in volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net
gain in MSR risk management compared with a net loss
in the prior year driven by updates to model inputs
and higher operating revenue on a higher level of
third-party loans serviced,

• higher asset management, administration and
commissions revenue predominantly driven by travel-
related commissions and increased annuity sales, and

• higher deposit-related fees due to higher service
fee volume.

Noninterest expense was $23.5 billion, up 9%,
reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural
expenses, largely driven by compensation, marketing
and technology,

partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, largely
driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto
lease assets, partially offset by higher operating
losses.

The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $1.8 billion, down $403 million,
driven by Card, reflecting the ongoing financial
strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit
balances continue to decline, impacted by the growth
in consumer spending, and

• a $125 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses driven by Card, reflecting higher
outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a
reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede.

The prior year included an $8.2 billion reduction in
the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $219 million and $355 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being
placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021
Form 10-K for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to customers that have
exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were
considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $57 million and $5 million of PPP loans 90 or more
days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, respectively.

(d) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, included $791 million and $11.1 billion of loans, respectively, in Business
Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans
are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the PPP.

(e) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic was $454 million and $3.1 billion in Home Lending, respectively. Loans that are
performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 110-116 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on consumer payment
assistance activity.

(f) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $284 million and
$432 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee.

according to Dealogic.

75%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.4 billion,
down 39%, as volatile market conditions resulted in
lower issuance activity.

– Advisory fees were $2.3 billion, down 18%, driven by
a lower level of announced deals.

• Payments revenue was $5.3 billion, up 19%, and
included the net impact of equity investments.
Excluding this net impact, Payments revenue was $5.4
billion, up 25% driven by improved deposit margins and
growth in fees on higher volumes.

• Lending revenue was $1.1 billion, up 43%, driven by
higher net interest income on higher loans, as well as
fair value gains on hedges of accrual loans, compared
with losses in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.9
billion, up 1%. Markets revenue was $23.3 billion, up
5%.

Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $8.4 billion, down 2%,
driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely
offset by Derivatives.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%,
driven by improved deposit margins and growth in fees,
largely offset by lower market levels and lower
deposits.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $773
million, reflecting funding spread widening, and to a
lesser extent losses on exposure relating to
commodities and Russia and Russia-associated
counterparties, compared with a gain of $338 million
in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $20.7 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by higher structural expense and
investments in the business, including higher
compensation, as well as higher legal expense,
partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-related
expense primarily revenue-related compensation.

predominantly driven by a net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, reflecting the impact of
updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast and loan
growth.

a net benefit of $1.0 billion, driven by a net
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $111 million and $138 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at
September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $143 million and $289 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(c) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.

(d) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a
non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets may occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant
source of principal transactions revenue was the
amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $946 million, down 33%, reflecting a
net increase in the provision for credit losses
compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $3.0 billion, up 21% compared to the
prior year. Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up
44%, driven by the impact of higher deposit margins
and growth in loans, predominantly offset by the
impact of higher funding costs on loans and lower
deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $836 million, down 15%, driven
by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-
related fees, partially offset by mark-ups on held-
for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments in
the bridge financing portfolio.

Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, up 14%, largely
driven by higher structural and volume- and revenue-
related expense, including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $618 million,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit
losses, largely driven by growth in loans and lending-
related commitments and the impact of updates to the
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, compared with a net
benefit of $363 million in the prior year.

pages 57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages

and the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results

Net income was $2.8 billion, down 30%, reflecting a
net increase in the provision for credit losses
compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $8.1 billion, up 10% compared to the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.5 billion, up
22%, driven by the impact of higher deposit margins
and growth in loans, largely offset by the impact of
higher funding costs on loans.

Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, down 9%, driven
by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns
on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio,
partially offset by a gain on an equity method
investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan.

Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, up 16%,
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related and structural expense, including
compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit
losses, driven by growth in loans and lending-related
commitments and the impact of updates to the Firm's

(a) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Net income was $1.2 billion, up 2%.

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up 6%. Net interest
income was $1.4 billion, up 43%. Noninterest revenue
was $3.1 billion, down 6%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, down
5%, largely driven by:

• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in
market levels and the impact of net outflows, largely
offset by the removal of most money market fund fee
waivers, and

• net investment valuation losses compared to net
gains in the prior year,

largely offset by

• higher performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.3 billion, up
19%, driven by:

• improved margins and growth in deposits and to a
lesser extent in loans,

partially offset by

• lower management fees reflecting a decline in market
levels, largely offset by net inflows, and

• lower brokerage fees on reduced volume.

Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, up 10%, driven
by higher structural expense and investments in the
business, largely compensation.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$102 million, predominantly driven by a net reduction
in the allowance for credit losses.

pages 57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
73-75 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

(c) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Net loss was $294 million, compared with a net loss of
$916 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $302 million, compared with
a loss of $1.3 billion in the prior year, driven by
higher net interest income due to higher rates,
partially offset by lower noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion,
compared with a loss of $242 million in the prior
year, predominantly driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios, and

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on
certain revenues, primarily as a result of the U.S.
dollar strengthening,

partially offset by

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO,
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, and

• lower net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments.

Noninterest expense of $305 million was up $145
million, predominantly driven by:

• higher investments, including the costs associated
with the Firm's international consumer growth
initiatives, and

• higher structural expense, including higher
compensation predominantly offset by the impact of
movements in foreign exchange rates on certain
expenses, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is
transferred

to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses
was not material to net income.

The current period income tax benefit was
predominantly driven by benefits related to tax audit
settlements and the change in the level and mix of
income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and
local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax
reserves.

Net loss was $1.3 billion, compared with a net loss of
$3.1 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion, compared with
a loss of $2.9 billion in the prior year, driven by
higher net interest income due to higher rates,
partially offset by lower noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.7 billion,
compared with a loss of $68 million in the prior year,
driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios,

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange on
certain revenues, primarily as result of the U.S.
dollar strengthening,

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments compared with net gains in prior year,

• net losses, including hedging costs on an equity
method investment related to the Firm's international
consumer growth initiatives, and

• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash
deployment transactions, which were more than offset
by the related net interest income earned on these
transactions,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first
quarter of 2022, and

• higher net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments.

Noninterest expense of $695 million was down $856
million, predominantly driven by:

• l ower structural expense reflecting the impact of
movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses
primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening, and lower technology expense, partially
offset by higher compensation related expense,

largely offset by

• higher investments, including the costs associated
with the Firm's international consumer growth
initiatives.

The prior year included a contribution to the Firm's
Foundation.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is
transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in
a manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors and protects the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide
structures for risk governance. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance and oversight
framework The Firm’s risk management governance and
oversight framework involves understanding drivers of
risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to
pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s
Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate the SLR. While the Firm’s SLR is
currently more binding than the Basel III
Standardized-risk-based ratios, the Firm expects that
in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Basel III
Standardized-risk-based ratios will become more
binding due to increases in the Firm's risk-based
regulatory capital requirements. As a result, the Firm
announced the redemption of $5.43 billion of preferred
stock and issued $3.5 billion of subordinated notes in
the third quarter of 2022 to rebalance the Firm's
capital components. Refer to SLR on page 48 and
capital actions on pages 48-49 for additional
information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31,
2021, the CECL capital transition provisions , which
delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for
two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, the
$2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of
December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of September 30, 2022,
CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion
benefit associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm
phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital
transition provisions recognized as of December 31,
2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”),
which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to
measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the
Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal
models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used
to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital
framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking
regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III
Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased
the Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40
billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of
December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of
approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio
and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure.
In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the
Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than
Standardized.

Risk-based Capital Targets

The Firm's current target for its Basel III
Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 12.5% for the
fourth quarter of 2022 and 13.0% by the end of the
first quarter of 2023. These targets are based on the
Basel III capital rules currently in effect, taking
into account the Firm's increasing risk-based
regulatory capital requirements.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for
a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk. LCR
and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their
respective estimated total net cash outflows over a
prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant
stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in
excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months
ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September
30, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR
framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR
increased during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2022,
predominantly due to long-term debt issuances and CIB Markets activities.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with
the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily from a
reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth, non-HQLA investment security
purchases, and a decline in the market value of HQLA-eligible investment securities in Treasury and CIO, partially
offset by an increase in deposits. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities
portfolio. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in
its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and
net cash outflows. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes
would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $771 billion
and $914 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity
that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value
decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”)
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $317 billion and $308 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central
banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires
that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain
an amount of “available” stable funding that is
sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable
funding over a one-year horizon.

As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding
of the final rule. The Firm will be required to
publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi
annually beginning in 2023.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the
Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-
bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
which are primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce
the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.
A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are
consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,
which are both considered to be stable sources of
liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm. The table below
shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-
deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total
liabilities, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end
deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were higher for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2021, reflecting: • an increase in CCB driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both
consumer and small busines s customers, and growth in time deposits in AWM, partially offset by • declines in both
Payments and Securities Services in CIB and in non-operating deposits in CB. Average deposits were higher for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting: • increases
in CCB driven by growth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, and • net
inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by • a decline
in Securities Services in CIB. Period-end deposits have declined as a result of the migration that began in the
second quarter of 2022. The decrease in period-end deposits reflects a reduction in non-operating deposits in CB,
and in AWM net outflows into investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by
growth from new consumer and small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the
                                                        53                                                         
decline in deposits in existing accounts as spending
continued to grow.

The increase in deposits in Corporate was driven by
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

(a) Primarily consists of short-term securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.

(b) Included in beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities on the Firm’s Consolidated

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at September 30,
2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of
netting on client-driven market-making activities in
Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing
of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in
commercial paper for the average three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year
period, and the decrease in commercial paper at
September 30, 2022, from December 31, 2021, was due to
changes in the net issuance levels primarily for
short-term liquidity management.
                                                        54                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory
requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market
access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating
its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and
Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

(a) Includes long-term structured notes that are secured.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan
securitizations.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of
a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements
for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral
agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2022, were as follows:

(d) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included $791 million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in
Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the
loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of the PPP.

(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available

of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

(j) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due
and insured by U.S. government agencies of $362 million and $623 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(l) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $57 million and $506 million,
respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $14.9 billion and $35.2 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were $19.0 billion and $27.9 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-
off/(recovery) rates.

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,
2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair
value and auto and other loans, largely offset by
higher retained residential real estate loans.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage
loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
increased compared to December 31, 2021, reflecting
originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual
loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting
improved credit performance and loan sales. Net
recoveries were lower for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same
periods in the prior year driven by lower prepayments
in the current year due to higher interest rates.
Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021,
as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced
originations due to higher interest rates and lower
loan purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at
fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by
net portfolio activity in CIB. The carrying value of
home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.3
billion at September 30, 2022. This amount included
$5.3 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-
only to fully amortizing payments or have been
modified and $5.2 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the
extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting
a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage
loans were $35.7 billion and $30.0 billion,
respectively. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-
rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to
maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential
mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable
with the performance of the broader prime mortgage
portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

include both TDRs and modified purchased credit
deteriorated (“PCD”) loans not accounted for as TDRs.
The following table does not include loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs.

(a) At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
nonaccrual loans included $2.7 billion of TDRs for
which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due.
Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for additional information about loans modified in a
TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists
of prime-quality scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased
when compared with December 31, 2021 predominantly due
to PPP loan forgiveness in business banking and
paydowns predominantly offset by loan originations in
the scored auto portfolio. Net charge-offs increased
for the three months ended September 30, 2022 when
compared to the same period in the prior year due to
higher overdraft and scored auto charge-offs. Net
charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 increased when compared to the same period in the
prior year due to higher overdraft and scored auto
charge-offs, partially offset by lower scored business
banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net
charge-off rates were 0.27% and 0.03% for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, and 0.19% and 0.01% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as
net charge-offs benefited from government stimulus and
payment assistance programs in the prior year.

under payment deferral programs offered in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their
deferral period and performing according to their
modified terms are generally not considered
delinquent.
                                                        62                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Credit card                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
Total credit card loans increased from December 31,
2021 largely driven by growth in revolving balances on
higher consumer spending and net new originations. The
September 30, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates
of 1.23% and 0.57%, respectively, increased compared
to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency
rates of 1.04% and 0.50% but remain below pre-pandemic
levels. Net charge-offs increased for the three months
ended September 30, 2022 compared with the same period
in the prior year driven by loan growth. Net charge-
offs decreased for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 compared with the same period in the prior year .
Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to
benefit from the ongoing financial strength of U.S.
consumers. However, median deposit balances continue
to decline, impacted by the growth in consumer
spending .

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

At September 30, 2022, the Firm had $794 million of
credit card loans outstanding that have been modified
in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December
31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 for additional information
about loan modification programs to borrowers.
                                                        63                                                         
                              
  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including
business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the
allowance for credit losses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, credit continued to perform well with
charge-offs remaining low. As of September 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming exposure was driven by a decline
in lending related commitments and loans, predominantly in CIB and AWM, as a result of net portfolio activity and
upgrades, largely offset by downgrades including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the
first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 and Country Risk on pages 82-83 for additional
information. As of September 30, 2022, retained loans increased $35.9 billion driven by CB and CIB, including
increased revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $13.5
billion driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge
financing portfolio, partially offset by net portfolio activity in AWM.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30,
2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

  Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.0 billion and $38.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. C riticized
exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-
specific downgrades, including declines in Consumer & Retail, Real Estate and Technology, Media &
Telecommunications. Of the $31.0 billion of criticized exposure at September 30, 2022, approximately half was
undrawn and $28.3 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

related to Oil & Gas prices. Criticized exposure decreased by $1.0 billion from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021
to $647 million at September 30, 2022, driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades partially
offset by client-specific downgrades.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Since September 30,
2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $596 million
driven by paydowns and client-specific upgrades in
Real Estate, Individuals and Oil & Gas, partially
offset by client-specific downgrades, including
downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated
clients in the first quarter of 2022.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to
which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central
counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible,
the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 88% at both September 30, 2022, and
December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements
and for a further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets were $92.5 billion and
$57.1 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31,
2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven
by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative
receivables as a result of market movements.
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally
enforceable master netting agreements and the related
cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that may be used as security when the
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer
to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use
of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance
for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the
allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in
accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
September 30, 2022 was $20.8 billion, reflecting a net
addition of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2021,
consisting of: $1.9 billion in wholesale and $168
million in consumer. The net addition to the wholesale
allowance resulted from: • loan growth predominantly
in CB and CIB, and • changes to the Firm's
macroeconomic forecast reflecting – updates to the
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios including an increasing
forecasted unemployment rate and deterioration in the
equity market indices, and – the impact of the
increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios
beginning in the first quarter of 2022, due to the
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the
war in Ukraine. The increase in the consumer allowance
was driven by Card, reflecting a net addition to the
allowance for loan losses resulting from higher
outstanding balances predominantly offset by a
reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede. The Firm's allowance
for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed macroeconomic
scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more
punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in
a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at
5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6% lower
U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.
unemployment rate. (b) As of September 30, 2022, the
year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast
horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the
percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior
year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related
estimates will be reflected in the provision for
credit losses in future periods. Refer to Note 13 and

(a) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed
probable, modified PCD loans, and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to
be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider
any incremental penalty rates.

(b) At September 30, 2022, excludes an allowance for credit losses associated with certain accounts receivable in
CIB of $30 million.

(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

(d) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on investment securities of $61 million and $73 million as of
September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At September 30,
2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was
$616.5 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
42-43 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
51-56 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 77-81
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can
vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of
CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.
This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility
in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR which remained elevated for the
period ended June 30, 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR
decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related exposure when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022.

(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity
position which is publicly traded.

(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components
and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended
September 30, 2022 when compared with June 30, 2022,
reflecting increased market volatility impacting Fixed
income, offset by risk reductions within CIB and
Credit Portfolio VaR.

Average total VaR increased by $18 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2022, compared with
the same period in the prior year. This increase was
predominantly driven by market volatility impacting
Fixed income.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR
for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in
March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related
counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on
average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 261 days, and observed
25 VaR backtesting exceptions due to market volatility that was materially higher than the levels realized in the
historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted
backtesting gains on 33 of the 66 days, and observed seven VaR backtesting exceptions predominantly driven by
interest rate volatility.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended September 30, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt
and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the
table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying
positions included in earnings-at-risk. One way the
Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest
rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a
baseline, which includes net interest income and
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline
uses market interest rates and in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in
U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include
retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,
investment securities, long-term debt and any related
interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk
scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and
scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the
reversal of Quantitative Easing. • The pricing
sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,
represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could
change upon a given change in market interest rates.
The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from
actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-
risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the
Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8
for additional information). The Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities are presented in the table below.

(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these
scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of
December 31, 2021. The change in the Firm’s U.S.
dollar sensitivities as of September 30, 2022 compared
to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm’s
baseline for higher interest rates and higher
corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the
impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. As of
September 30, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the
+/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in
rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from
liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets
repricing, while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-
term rates is primarily the result of a greater impact
from assets repricing compared to the impact of
liabilities repricing. The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar
sensitivities are presented in the table below.

(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these
scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of
December 31, 2021. The results of the non-U.S. dollar
interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter
yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing
by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at
current levels were not material to the Firm’s
earnings-at-risk at September 30, 2022 and December
31, 2021 .

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2022 and December
31, 2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of
CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.
This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be
exposed to country risk resulting from financial,
economic, political or other significant developments
which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s
exposures related to a particular country or set of
countries. The Country Risk Management group actively
monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted
by these developments and measures the extent to which
the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s
strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country
risk management.
                                                                                                                   
  Sources and measurement                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its
lending and deposits, investing, and market-making
activities, whether cross-border or locally funded.
Country exposure includes activity with both
government and private-sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual
country is based on the country where the largest
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest
proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be
different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or
country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of
the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero
recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or
guarantors attributed to that country. Activities
which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a
country are not included in the country exposure
measure (for example, providing clearing services or
secondary exposure to collateral on securities
financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure,
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or
index products, or where the nature of the
counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not
suitable for attribution to an individual country. The
use of different measurement approaches or assumptions
could affect the amount of reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement
framework:

• Lending exposures are measured at the total
committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the
allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and
marketable securities collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed
with central banks, commercial banks, and other
financial institutions

• Securities financing exposures are measured at their
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral
received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair
value of all positions, including both long and short
positions

• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the
fair value of the eligible collateral received

• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for
the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the
fair value of the derivative receivable or payable;
reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these
exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs
from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank
regulatory requirements.
                                                        82                                                         
Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of
September 30, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents
the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country
exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to
Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central
banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities. The decrease in exposure to
Australia was largely driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia, due to client-driven
market-making activities and lower client cash deposits following recent interest rate increases. As of September
30, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $600 million. This amount excludes certain client deposits placed at
depository institutions.

  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                               
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes
or systems, human factors, or external events
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational
Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest
itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control),
cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure
to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations
or failure of vendors or other third party providers
to perform in accordance with their agreements.
Operational Risk Management attempts to manage
operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the
Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its
businesses, and the markets and regulatory
environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on
other select examples of operational risks are
provided below.

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions
have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated
entities and individuals by various governments around
the world, including the authorities in the U.S., the
U.K. and the EU. These sanctions are complex and
continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face
increased operational risk associated with
interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance
programs. To manage this increased risk, the Firm
implemented additional controls reasonably designed to
mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent
dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject
to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments
as required by the applicable regulations.

Business and technology resiliency risk

Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide
Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the
Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover
from business disruptions including occurrence of an
extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact
critical business functions and supporting assets
(i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third
parties). The program includes governance, awareness
training, planning and testing of recovery strategies,
as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to
identify, assess, and manage business interruption and
public safety risks.

Cybersecurity Risk

The Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber
attacks due to potential retaliation for the sanctions
imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm
implemented additional precautionary measures and
controls reasonably designed to address this increased
risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be
no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to
protect against cybersecurity breaches will provide
absolute security against cyber attacks.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75
and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that
are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with
modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a
subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and
geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,
corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real
estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher

over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of

3.0% in the third quarter of 2023; lower

U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining
approximately 4.2% lower at the end of the eight-
quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023; and
lower national HPI with a peak difference of
approximately 13.6% in the second quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including:

• The allowance as of September 30, 2022, reflects
credit losses beyond those estimated under the central
scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables.
                                                        85                                                         
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio
composition and borrower behavior can significantly
affect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate
the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2022, the
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses, the comparison between these two
scenarios for the exposures below reflect the
following differences: • An increase of approximately
$500 million for residential real estate loans and
lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $2.5 billion for credit card loans • An
increase of approximately $4.2 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,
particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and
that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended
September 30, 2022.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

and $9.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated

driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on
accelerated spend and promotional offers outpacing
redemptions throughout 2022. Refer to page 152 of

“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

certain assets and liabilities;

calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational

however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”),
a financial holding company incorporated under
Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services
firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The
Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial
services for consumers and small businesses,
commercial banking, financial transaction processing
and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s business segments. The
accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines
prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in
conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense,
and the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could be different from
these estimates. In the opinion of management, all
normal, recurring adjustments have been included such
that this interim financial information is fairly
stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related
notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have
been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation.

Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other
entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for
clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm
are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included
on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm
determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the
entity is a voting interest entity or a variable
interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative
receivables and derivative payables with the same
counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable
master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities financing activities to be
presented on a net basis when specified conditions are
met, including the existence of a legally enforceable
master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net
such balances where it has determined that the
specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

(a) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 90.1billion and $
73.9billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        98                                                         
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 882million and $ 801million, respectively. Included in these balances at
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $ 41million and $ 51million, respectively, and
other assets of $ 841million and $ 750million, respectively.

(e) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $ 11.4billion and $ 26.2billion, respectively, of
residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 7.5billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien
mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.
GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.4billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 776million, nonagency securities of $ 9million and
non-trading loans of $ 900million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 11million, trading loans of $ 40million and non-trading loans of $
362million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 825million and non-trading loans of $ 312million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $ 807million including $ 227million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.
                                                        100                                                        
Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to
Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022
and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a
financial instrument within level 3, the determination
is based on the significance of the unobservable
inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,
level 3 financial instruments typically include, in
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are
actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the
table below include changes in fair value due in part
to observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities
related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2021, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 108 for further information on changes impacting
items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 Level 3 assets
were $ 24.3billion at September 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of $ 2.0billion from June 30, 2022, and an
increase of $ 6.8billion from December 31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was
driven by a $ 2.2billion increase in gross derivative receivables due to gains and net transfers partially offset
by settlements. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was predominantly driven by: • $
3.8billion increase in gross derivative receivables due to gains and purchases partially offset by settlements. • $
2.6billion increase in MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Refer to the sections below for additional
information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three
months ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $
1.1billion of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase
in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers
from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 524million of gross equity derivative receivables as a result
of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 2.0billion of
total debt and equity instruments, predominantly due to equity securities of $ 977million driven by a decrease in
observability as a result of restricted access to certain markets and trading loans of $ 777million driven by a
decrease in observability. • $ 1.5billion and $ 639million of gross interest rate derivative receivables and gross
interest rate derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 963million and $ 1.8billion of gross equity derivative receivables and
gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 829million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. • $
739million of long-term debt driven by a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of
unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1.0billion and $ 758million of gross interest rate
derivative receivables and gross interest rate derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.4billion and $ 1.8billion of gross
equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 764million of non-trading loans driven
by an increase in observability. • $ 878million of long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a
decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the three months ended
September 30, 2021, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 882million of total
debt and equity instruments, largely trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability.
                                                        106                                                        
• $ 937million of gross equity derivative receivables
and $ 704million of gross equity derivative payables
as a result of a decrease in observability and an
increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. •
$ 1.0billion of non-trading loans driven by a decrease
in observability. For the three months ended September
30, 2021, there were no significant transfers from
level 3 into level 2. For the nine months ended

result of an increase in observability and a decrease
in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $
673million of non-trading loans, driven by an increase
in observability. • $ 736million of long-term debt
driven, by an increase in observability and a decrease
in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain
structured notes. All transfers are based on changes
in the observability and/or significance of the
valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the
beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which
they occur. Gains and losses The following describes
significant components of total realized/unrealized
gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value
on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These
amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk
management activities where the financial instruments
are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair
value measurements rollforward tables on pages 101-106
for further information on these instruments. Three
months ended September 30, 2022 • $ 1.1billion of net
gains on assets, driven by gains in net equity
derivative receivables due to market movements and
gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on
higher rates. • $ 1.2billion of net gains on
liabilities, predominantly driven by gains in long-
term debt due to market movements. Three months ended
September 30, 2021 • $ 1.3billion of net gains on
assets, driven by gains in net interest rate
derivative receivables and net equity derivative
receivables due to market movements. • $ 928million of

net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in
net equity derivative receivables due to market
movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower
prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $ 6.2billion of
net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by
gains in long-term debt due to market movements. Nine
months ended September 30, 2021 • $ 1.0billion of net
gains on assets, driven by gains in net interest rate
derivative receivables due to market movements,
partially offset by losses in net commodity derivative
receivables due to market movements. • $ 988million of
net gains on liabilities, driven by gains in short-
term borrowings due to market movements. Refer to Note
14 for information on MSRs.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on
observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer
(measurement alternative). Of the $ 1.1billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as
of September 30, 2022, $ 1.0billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative.
These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the
restrictions on the shares.
(b) Of the $ 927million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022,
$ 65million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying
collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using
information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the
Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56% with a weighted average of
23%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is
recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.
(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.
The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by

  Note 3 – Fair value option                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were zeroand $( 6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $( 9) million
and $( 8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2022, and December 31,
2021, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the
fair value option was elected was $ 8.7billion and $ 11.9billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of
$ 28million and $ 10million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
126 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        117                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables
and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination
features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional
collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A
downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating
provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain
instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments
requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current
rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were
recorded in net interest income.
(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of
income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest
rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.
(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance
sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the
income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 15.0billion and $ 25.7billion at September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September
30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 15.2billion and $ 14.0billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 208million and $ 9.7billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been
revised to conform with the current presentation.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional
information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the
same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed and SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were
recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.1) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at September 30, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that
have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be
recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged
forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are
hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and
borrowing activities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of
protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts.
The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is
based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection
are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and
liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall
performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making
activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 6 for further
information on interest income and interest expense.

trading revenue presented in the table below is not
representative of the total revenue of any individual
LOB.

(a) Includes a $ 58million pension settlement loss.
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair values of plan assets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension
and OPEB plans were $ 19.4billion and $ 25.7billion, respectively.

During the period ended September 30, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan was
required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of plan
assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the projected benefit
obligation totaling $ 4.0billion and $ 2.6billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $ 1.4billion in
accumulated other comprehensive income (pre-tax).

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At September 30, 2022, the investment
securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). During the second quarter of
2022, the Firm transferred $ 73.2billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes.
AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $ 4.6billion on the securities at the date of transfer. Refer to Note 10
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.
The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 11.5billion and $ 2.2billion, at September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are
used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be
prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately nine yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six yearsfor both agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and
net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When the
Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets,
the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the
counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such
collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under
U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and
reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities
financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the
lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as
collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to
return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $ 295million and $ 440million, respectively, of
financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not
qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing
transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities
are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business
banking and auto dealer loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for
loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal
investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global
Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans
insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $ 27million and $ 35million; 30–149 days past due
included $ 11million for both periods; and 150 or more days past due included $ 15million and $ 20million,
respectively.
(b) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.
(c) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by
U.S. government agencies of $ 26million and $ 31million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 42million and $ 41million and $ 132million
and $ 127million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies.
Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement
rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these
balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were noloans that
were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2022.

(k) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $
53million and $ 66million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented
based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new
TDRs was $ 80million and $ 116million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $
313million and $ 674million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no
additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature
and extent of modifications The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including
U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not
limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments
that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides
information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs
described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted
is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions.

modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than
one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on
permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the
definition of a TDR.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and
for which the payment default occurred within one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real
estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or
another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not
be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At September 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently
modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both
voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by
U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 676million and $ 619million, respectively, that were not
included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $ 57million and $ 506million,
respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $ 53million and $
35million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the
principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to
meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more
days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2022.

Loan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new
TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021 were not material.

Loan modifications The Firm may offer loan
modification programs granting concessions to credit
card borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the
cardholder does not comply with the modified payment
terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and
will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the
Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit
card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the
periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for
retained wholesale loans.

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan
does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there
have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
Loan modifications

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs. New TDRs were $ 108million and $ 180million for the three months ended
September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively and $ 587million and $ 832million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New TDRs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected
extending maturity dates primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class in 2022 as well as principal
deferrals largely in the Other loan class in 2021. New TDRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021
reflected modifications that included extending maturity dates and covenant waivers for both periods as well as the
receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021 predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial loan
class. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

The carrying value of TDRs was $ 852million and $ 607million as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Refer to
Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a
detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses
and the related accounting policies.

(a) At September 30, 2022 excludes an allowance for credit losses associated with certain accounts receivable in
CIB of $ 30million.
(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed
probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to
be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider
any incremental penalty rates.
(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, lending-related commitments excluded $ 12.6billion and $ 19.9billion,
respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 798.9billion and $ 710.6billion,
respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 20.0billion and $ 41.0billion, respectively, for the
wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance
for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 was $
20.8billion, reflecting a net addition of $ 2.1billion
from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $ 1.9billion in
wholesale and $ 168million in consumer. The net
addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from: •
loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and • changes
to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting –
updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios
including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate
and deterioration in the equity market indices, and –
the impact of the increased weight placed on the
adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of
2022, due to the effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The
increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan
losses resulting from higher outstanding balances
predominantly offset by a reduction related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is
estimated using a weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse
scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic
factors than the central case assumptions provided in
the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter
of 2023, and a 1.6% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the
fourth quarter of 2023.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm
considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the
structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial
instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed
commercial paper conduit.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        154                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of
business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 12.5billion and
$ 13.7billion of the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September
30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 11.5billion and $ 13.4billion at
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for
more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond
vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow
institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third
party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer
TOB transactions.

(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line
item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of
these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in
beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.1billion and $ 2.6billion at September
30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
27.6billion and $ 26.8billion, of which $ 10.0billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold
varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for
more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        157                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $
6.2billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 was $ 8.2billion and $ 10.5billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized
and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and
other consumer loans.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from
Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them
and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with the applicable requirements, and such loans
continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s
repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must
be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a
loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11
for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these
loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies.

as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of September 30, 2022, the
Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual business
results and projections of business performance. Based
on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill
was not impaired as of September 30, 2022, or December
31, 2021, nor was goodwill written off due to
impairment during the nine months ended September 30,
2022 or 2021.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and
outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair
values to immediate adverse changes in those
assumptions, as defined below.

subsidiaries were obligated under a number of
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases
for premises and equipment used primarily for business
purposes.

assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term.
The following table provides information related to
the Firm’s operating leases:

Note 21 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were
subject as of September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021.

CECL regulatory capital transition

On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition
provisions , which delayed the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, expired. Beginning
January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit
recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being phased
out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
September 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the
remaining $ 2.2billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm
phased out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital
transition provisions recognized as of December 31,
2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September
30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.

are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a
contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.
If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for
the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.

Loan sales- and securitization-related
indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s
mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with
GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties
that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and
that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans
and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such
representations and warranties are breached by the
Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands
associated with private label securitizations is
separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form
10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for additional information regarding litigation.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house therefore the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 172. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 172 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged
assets.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business
and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.2billion at September 30, 2022. This estimated aggregate
range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in
which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm
does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,
including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about
the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be
incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into
account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual
losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB
Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in
relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and
paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between
1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the
validity of service and the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010
and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects
developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali,
including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential
units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021,
the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing
the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary
findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that
had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the
ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange
Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private
Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA
investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository
account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held
approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following
the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts.
The FRN alleged that the payments were
                                                        175                                                        
instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April
2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. The
FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately $
75million. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that
allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need the DOL to approve a
further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. In
October 2022, the DOL published a proposed exemption for the remainder of the disqualification period. This
proposal will be open for public comment until December 2022. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is
a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition
Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action
brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an
alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted
in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be
excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers
in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against
the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at
allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange
dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by
the Firm and 11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related
individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,
including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending before the
U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request
for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative
class action, which remains subject to court approval. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In December
2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective civil investigations
of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures
commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain
communications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping rules, where such communications
were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use
by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap
dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC paid a $ 125million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $ 75million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues
to respond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with
records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging
channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. In March 2022, a
shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York
against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws
based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation
requirements. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. The
plaintiff filed an amended complaint in August 2022, which defendants have moved to dismiss. Interchange
Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that
Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees
and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a
cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network
rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate
decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and
the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
                                                        176                                                        
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the
approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class
settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the
settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In addition, certain
merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against
the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations
and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around
the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an
infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of
litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification
of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A
consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark
Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting
antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S.
dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants
moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary
injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that
rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims in October 2022. The Firm’s settlements of
putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap
Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S.
Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain
of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively,
resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in
the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information
charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the
criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with
the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay
a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim
compensation payments. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals
futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints
also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New
York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022, the Court granted final approval of a
settlement among the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District
Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging
manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The
actions in the Northern District of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement
among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced
                                                        177                                                        
putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to precious metals. In
October 2020, twoputative class action complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual
defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC
filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating
to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021.
Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in
precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the putative class period were
materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit
purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York asserting breach
of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the
Firm. The complaint claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the shareholder’s demand to commence
litigation and seeks damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged supervisory
failures with regard to certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the subject of the Firm’s resolutions
with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the
subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. Defendants have moved to
dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P.
Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class
action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts
violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to
prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to
dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are
opposing. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries
are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm
believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal
proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to
time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal
proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-
related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation
reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best
judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 47million and $ 76million for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 239million and $ 289million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need
to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings,
particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal
theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with
confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal
proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of
the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material
reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s
operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability
imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported
U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity.
Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no
impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
                                                                                                                   
  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of September 30, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2022 and 2021 and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2022 and 2021, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “interim financial
statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware
of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 22, 2022, which
included a paragraph describing a change in the manner
of accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In
our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as
of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)

transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.
                                                        186                                                        
Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association (“SBA”)

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and
                                                        187                                                        
losses on financial and other instruments (including
those accounted for under the fair value option)
primarily used in client-driven market-making
activities and on private equity investments. In
connection with its client-driven market-making
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial
instruments that reference commodities). Principal
transactions revenue also includes certain realized
and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge
accounting and specified risk-management activities,
including: (a) certain derivatives designated in
qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily
fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange
risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk
and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds.
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating
and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a
fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings,
the assigned peer
                                                        191                                                        
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable,
the fund rating providers redenominate asset values
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a
“primary share class” level to represent the quartile
ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and
at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had
been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
