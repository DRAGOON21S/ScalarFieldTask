However, higher interest rates\ncan also lead to:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to\nhigher financing costs for clients\nthe loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that interest\nrates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of\ncompetitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect\nassumptions about depositor behavior\nlosses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held\nin the investment securities portfolio\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce\ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of\nshort-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect\nJPMorganChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital\nlevels, and any negative outcomes could be more severe\nin a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher\ninterest rates can also negatively affect the payment\nperformance on loans within JPMorganChase’s consumer\nand wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to\nvariable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate\nloans are unable to afford higher interest payments,\nthose borrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could\nreduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its\ninvestment securities portfolio to the extent that it\nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect\nJPMorganChase’s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorganChase’s mortgage\nservicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, resulting in\ndecreased revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive\nfor JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase’s credit\nspreads may widen or narrow not only in response to\nevents and circumstances that are specific to\nJPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic\nand geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in\nJPMorganChase’s credit spreads will affect, positively\nor negatively, JPMorganChase’s earnings on certain\nliabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at\nfair value.\nJPMorganChase’s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the\nvaluation of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets can be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and other disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may make it extremely difficult to\nvalue certain financial instruments. Subsequent\nvaluations of financial instruments in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, at the time of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of\nthese factors could cause a decline in the value of\nfinancial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets, which may have an adverse\neffect on JPMorganChase’s results of operations.\nJPMorganChase’s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase’s exposure\nto more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase’s\nhedging and other risk management strategies may not\nbe effective, and it could incur significant losses,\nif extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,\nsecurities exchanges and government entities within\nand outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose\nJPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and\ncounterparties, and can involve JPMorganChase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses\n18\nor liability where a financial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services for client\nassets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud\nor the failure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations, or where clients are unable to access\nassets held by JPMorganChase as custodian due to\ngovernmental actions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure\nof, a CCP through which JPMorganChase executes\ncontracts would require JPMorganChase to replace those\ncontracts, thereby increasing its operational costs\nand potentially resulting in losses. In addition,\nJPMorganChase can be exposed to losses if a member of\na CCP in which JPMorganChase is also a member defaults\non its obligations to the CCP because of requirements\nthat each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those\nlosses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase can be subject to\nbearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a\nCCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or\ninvestment activities or due to cyber or other\nsecurity breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities,\nJPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance\nby its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by\nrequiring clients to provide adequate collateral.\nJPMorganChase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk\nof its clients in connection with providing cash\nmanagement, clearing, custodial and other transaction\nservices to those clients. If a client for which\nJPMorganChase provides these services becomes bankrupt\nor insolvent, JPMorganChase may incur losses, become\ninvolved in disputes and litigation with one or more\nCCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other\ncreditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations.\nAll of the foregoing events can increase\nJPMorganChase’s operational and litigation costs, and\nJPMorganChase may suffer losses to the extent that any\ncollateral that it has received is insufficient to\ncover those losses.\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorganChase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks.\nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim\nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond\nthe legal authority of those officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous incumbent\ngovernment. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorganChase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct\nbusiness in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could\nlimit JPMorganChase’s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or\nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments,\nwhich could subject JPMorganChase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives\ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement\nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could cause\nJPMorganChase to incur unexpected transaction,\noperational and legal costs, or result in credit\nlosses. These consequences can also impair\nJPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage its\ncredit risk exposure from its market activities, or\ncause harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant\nmarket participant, such as a major financial\ninstitution or a CCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market participant or its\nability to fulfill its obligations, can cause\nsubstantial and cascading disruption within the\nfinancial markets, including in circumstances where\ncoordinated action by multiple other market\nparticipants is required to address the failure or\ndisruption. JPMorganChase’s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event, particularly\nif it leads to other market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or\ndefaulting, and JPMorganChase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with, and credit\nexposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorganChase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorganChase’s credit risk may be further increased\nwhen:\nJPMorganChase fails to realize the estimated value\nof the collateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning\nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or illiquidity,\nand JPMorganChase could suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the fair value of\ncollateral or to manage declines in the value of\ncollateral.\nJPMorganChase could incur significant losses arising\nfrom concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorganChase is exposed to greater credit and market\nrisk to the extent that groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties, or obligors on securities and other\nfinancial instruments:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\n19",

This type of\ninterrelationship could exacerbate JPMorganChase’s\ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses, including fair\nvalue losses in its market-making businesses and\ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase may\nbe required to increase the allowance for credit\nlosses or establish other reserves with respect to\ncertain clients, industries or country exposures in\norder to align with directives or expectations of its\nbanking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect\na particular industry or geographic area could lead to\nconcerns about the credit quality of counterparties,\nborrowers or other obligors not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These\nconditions could also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of JPMorganChase’s consumer\nbusinesses who live in those areas or work in those\naffected industries or related or dependent industries\nto meet their obligations to JPMorganChase.\nJPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments of\nits credit and market risk exposures to assess the\npotential risks of concentration or contagion, but its\nability to diversify or hedge its exposure against\nthose risks may be limited.\nJPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed\nby an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank\nor non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for\ncertain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-\nwide reactions such as significant reductions in the\npricing or margins of those loans or the making of\nloans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers\nof consumers subsequently default on their loans,\nwhether due to weak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could impair their\nability to repay obligations owed to JPMorganChase and\nresult in higher charge-offs and other credit-related\nlosses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer\ndebt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S.\neconomy, and JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses may\nearn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks associated\nwith those positions and the level of risk-weighted-\nassets (“RWA”) that JPMorganChase holds on its\nbalance sheet. These factors could adversely affect\nJPMorganChase’s capital position, funding costs and\nthe profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorganChase’s liquidity can be impacted at any given\ntime as a result of factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nchanges in liquidity or capital requirements\nresulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations,\nincluding those in response to economic effects of\nsystemic events\nactions taken by the U.S. government or by the\nFederal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which may\nreduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and other\nfinancial institutions\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in\nJPMorganChase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorganChase’s liquidity may be caused\nby events over which it has little or no control. For\nexample, periods of market stress, low investor\nconfidence and significant market illiquidity could\nresult in higher funding costs for JPMorganChase and\ncould limit its access to some of its traditional\nsources of liquidity.\nJPMorganChase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced.\nAlternative sources of funding could be more expensive\nor limited in availability. JPMorganChase’s funding\ncosts could also be negatively affected by actions\nthat JPMorganChase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net\nstable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorganChase fails to effectively\nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability\nto fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries,\nand thereby adversely affect its results of\noperations.\n20\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends\non the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments\non its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds\nthe stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings\nLLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the\nstock of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other than\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The\nIHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany\nlending to the Parent Company.\nThe Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the\nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior\nand subordinated debt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC\nto make payments to the Parent Company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions,\nas well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity\nrequirements and other regulatory restrictions on its\nability to make payments to the Parent Company. The\nIHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the Parent Company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are\notherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management\nor Board of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the\nParent Company to make various payments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect the Parent Company’s ability\nto:\npay interest on its debt securities\npay dividends on its equity securities\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the Parent\nCompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or\notherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a\ntime earlier than would have been the case absent the\nexistence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to\nwhich JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are\nsubject.\nReductions in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and\nindustry-specific factors when determining credit\nratings for a particular financial institution,\nincluding:\nexpected future profitability\nrisk management practices\nlegal expenses\nratings differentials between bank holding companies\nand their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\nregulatory developments\nassumptions about government support, and\neconomic and geopolitical developments.\nJPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could influence\nits credit ratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorganChase’s credit ratings will not be\ndowngraded in the future. Furthermore, any such\ndowngrade could occur at times of broader market\ninstability when JPMorganChase’s options for\nresponding to events may be more limited and general\ninvestor confidence is low.\nA reduction in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorganChase’s business activities and reduce\nits profitability in a number of ways, including:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorganChase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk\non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This\ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorganChase’s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving regulatory\nrequirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory capital\nrequirements, including leverage- and risk-based\ncapital requirements. In addition, as a Global\nSystemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorganChase is\nrequired to hold additional capital buffers, including\na GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and\na countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed\nat least annually. The amount of capital that\nJPMorganChase is required to hold in order to satisfy\nthese leverage- and risk-based requirements could\nincrease at any given time due to factors such as:\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in\nlaws, rules and regulations\n21",

In addition, in 2023\nthe Federal Reserve released a proposal to amend the\ncalculation of the GSIB surcharge. Uncertainty remains\nregarding the content of the final versions of these\nrule proposals and how they might ultimately apply to\nJPMorganChase. However, it is possible that the final\nrules could impact JPMorganChase’s decisions\nconcerning the business activities in which it will\nengage and its levels of capital distributions to its\nshareholders.\nOperational\nJPMorganChase’s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of internal and external operational\nsystems.\nJPMorganChase’s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorganChase’s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems, including devices supporting those systems,\nto process, record, monitor and report a large number\nof transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so\naccurately, quickly and securely. In addition to\nproper design, installation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorganChase’s\noperational systems depends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or\ncorrupted data can significantly compromise the\nfunctionality or reliability of a particular system\nand other systems to which it transmits or from which\nit receives information, and\nJPMorganChase’s ability to continue to maintain and\nupgrade its systems on a regular and timely basis in\nline with technological advancements and evolving\nsecurity requirements, maintain security and\noperational continuity of its systems, including by\ncarefully managing any changes introduced to its\nsystems, prevent unauthorized access and the misuse of\naccess to its systems, and adhere to all applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements, particularly in\nregions where JPMorganChase may face a heightened risk\nof malicious activity.\nJPMorganChase has experienced and expects that it will\ncontinue to experience failures and disruptions in the\nstability of its operational systems, including\ndegraded performance of data processing systems, data\nquality issues, disruptions of network connectivity\nand malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in\nits ability to access and use the operational systems\nof third parties and interruptions in service from\nthird-party service providers. These incidents have\nresulted in various negative effects for customers,\nincluding the inability to access account information\nor transact through ATM, internet or mobile channels,\nthe exfiltration of customer personal data, the\nrecording of duplicative transactions and extended\ndelays for customers requiring services from call\ncenters. There can be no assurance that these and\nother types of operational failures or disruptions\nwill not occur in the future.\nJPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage the\nstability of its operational systems and\ninfrastructure could be hindered by many factors, any\nof which could have a negative impact on JPMorganChase\nand its clients, customers and counterparties,\nincluding:\nJPMorganChase’s ability to effectively maintain and\nupgrade systems and infrastructure can become more\nchallenging as the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of transactions\ncontinue to increase\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorganChase\nor its clients and customers continue to increase,\nevolve and become more complex, and during periods of\nmarket disruption or economic uncertainty, these\nattempts can be expected to further increase in volume\nerrors made by JPMorganChase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, could\ncause widespread system disruption\nfailure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in\noperational systems in a timely manner\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems could compound, or migrate to\nother systems over time, to become larger issues\n22\ndisruptions in operational systems or in the ability\nof systems to communicate with each other could be\ncaused by failures in synchronization or encryption\nsoftware, or degraded performance of microprocessors,\nand\nattempts by third parties to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nJPMorganChase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of third parties,\nincluding its custodians, vendors (such as those that\nprovide data and cloud computing services, and\nsecurity and technology services) and other market\nparticipants (such as clearing and payment systems,\nCCPs and securities exchanges). These external\noperational systems with which JPMorgan is connected,\nwhether directly or indirectly, can be sources of\noperational risk to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase may\nbe exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber\nattack that may be experienced by a vendor or market\ninfrastructure with which JPMorganChase is directly\nconnected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber\nattack involving another party to which such a vendor\nor infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers,\npayment systems and processors, data aggregators and\nother external parties with which JPMorganChase’s\ncustomers do business can increase JPMorganChase’s\noperational risk. This is particularly the case where\nactivities of customers or other parties are beyond\nJPMorganChase’s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud\ncomputing services, and personal smart phones and\nother mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorganChase’s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in\nnegative outcomes for JPMorganChase and its clients\nand customers, including a heightened risk of\nfraudulent transactions using JPMorganChase’s systems,\nlosses from fraudulent transactions and reputational\nharm arising from the perception that JPMorganChase’s\nsystems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorganChase’s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorganChase increasingly faces the risk of\noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to\nthe systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorganChase’s clients or customers, or\nsystems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or\nhuman error or misconduct affecting other external\nparties, may require JPMorganChase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems\nor to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorganChase’s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorganChase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial\ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing\nhouses and other financial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that the disruption of an\noperational system involving one institution or\nentity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause\nindustry-wide operational disruptions that could\nmaterially affect JPMorganChase’s ability to conduct\nbusiness. In addition, the risks associated with the\ndisruption of an operational system of a third party\ncould be exacerbated to the extent that the services\nprovided by that system are used by a significant\nnumber or proportion of market participants.\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorganChase depends,\nincluding due to a systems malfunction, cyber incident\nor other systems failure, could result in unfavorable\nripple effects in the financial markets and for\nJPMorganChase and its clients and customers,\nincluding:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services,\nincluding the provision of liquidity or information to\nclients and customers\nimpairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to execute\ntransactions, including delays or failures in the\nconfirmation or settlement of transactions or in\nobtaining access to funds or other assets required for\nsettlement\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients\nand customers\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing\nservices provided by a system that has experienced a\nfailure or other disruption\nlimitations on JPMorganChase's ability to collect\ndata needed for its business and operations\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorganChase,\nor financial institutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational disruptions\ndissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients or\ncustomers\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nIf JPMorganChase’s operational systems, or those of\nacquired businesses or of external parties on which\n23",

These\ncyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts\nto introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which\nare commonly referred to as “malware,” into\nJPMorganChase’s systems. These attacks are often\ndesigned to:\nobtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's\nsystems or to confidential information belonging to\nJPMorganChase or its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on\nJPMorganChase’s systems\nsteal money, or\nextort money through the use of so-called\n“ransomware.”\nJPMorganChase also experiences:\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks intended to\ndisrupt JPMorganChase’s websites, including those that\nprovide online banking and other services,\na higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks\nagainst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical\ntensions, and\na high volume of disruptions to internet-based\nservices used by JPMorganChase that are provided by\nthird parties.\nJPMorganChase has experienced security breaches due to\ncyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that\nadditional breaches will occur in the future. Any such\nbreach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorganChase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot provide\nabsolute security against cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate, detect or\nrecognize threats to JPMorganChase’s systems, or to\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches due to evolving risks, including:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and increase in sophistication, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched or may\ngo undetected for extended periods\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of\nsources, including JPMorganChase’s own employees,\ncyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to\nterrorist organizations or hostile nation-states that\ncan sustain malicious activities for extended periods,\nor third parties whose objective is to disrupt the\noperations of financial institutions more generally\nJPMorganChase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network without\nbeing detected, may gain access to other networks and\nsystems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such as:\nJPMorganChase’s ongoing expansion of its digital\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings and\nits internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud computing\nservices\nadvances in artificial intelligence, such as the use\nof machine learning, generative

While such an\ninvestigation is ongoing, JPMorganChase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by\nthe cyber attack, and that damage may continue to\nspread. These factors may inhibit JPMorganChase’s\nability to provide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and regulators, as well as\nthe public.

Governmental authorities around the world\nhave adopted and are considering the adoption of\nnumerous legislative and regulatory initiatives\nconcerning privacy, data protection and security.\nLitigation or enforcement actions relating to these\nlaws, rules and regulations could result in fines or\norders requiring that JPMorganChase change its data-\nrelated practices, which could have an adverse effect\non JPMorganChase’s ability to provide products and\notherwise harm its business operations.\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorganChase’s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws, rules\nand regulations in all relevant jurisdictions,\nincluding where the laws of different jurisdictions\nare in conflict, can:\nincrease JPMorganChase’s compliance and operating\ncosts\nhinder the development of new products or services,\ncurtail the offering of existing products or services,\nor affect how products and services are offered to\nclients and customers\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorganChase’s\nmanagement, and\nrequire JPMorganChase to structure its businesses,\noperations and systems in less efficient ways.\nNot all of JPMorganChase’s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties may\nhave appropriate controls in place to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of the\n26\ninformation exchanged between them and JPMorganChase,\nparticularly where information is transmitted by\nelectronic means. JPMorganChase could be exposed to\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions if personal information of clients,\ncustomers, employees or others were to be mishandled\nor misused, such as situations where such information\nis:\nerroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized\nthird parties.\nThe increasing sophistication of artificial\nintelligence technologies poses a greater risk of\nidentity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit\nartificial intelligence to create convincing false\nidentities or manipulate verification processes. This\nchallenge necessitates ongoing enhancements to client\nverification systems and security protocols to prevent\nunauthorized access and protect sensitive client\ninformation. Failure to manage these risks or to\nimplement effective countermeasures could lead to\nunauthorized transactions, financial losses,\nreputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of\nJPMorganChase’s measures to safeguard personal\ninformation, or the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorganChase to lose existing\nor potential clients and customers or employees, and\nthereby reduce JPMorganChase’s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by JPMorganChase to\ncomply with applicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations, or any failure to\nappropriately calibrate, manage and monitor access by\nemployees or third parties to personal information,\ncould subject JPMorganChase to inquiries, examinations\nand investigations that could result in requirements\nto modify or cease certain operations or practices,\nsignificant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties\nor other sanctions. Any of these could damage\nJPMorganChase’s reputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving\nthe inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage\nof personal information have led to expanded\ngovernmental scrutiny of practices relating to the\nprocessing or safeguarding of personal information by\ncompanies in the U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in\nthe future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules and regulations relating to the collection, use,\nsharing and storage of personal information. These\ntypes of laws, rules and regulations can prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms such\nas JPMorganChase from transferring information across\nnational borders or sharing information among\naffiliates or with third parties such as vendors,\nthereby\nincrease compliance costs and operational risk, or\nrestrict JPMorganChase’s use of personal information\nwhen developing or offering products or services to\ncustomers. Some countries are considering or have\nadopted legislation implementing data protection\nrequirements or requiring local storage and processing\nof data which could increase the cost and complexity\nof JPMorganChase’s delivery of products and services.\nThese restrictions could also inhibit JPMorganChase’s\ndevelopment or marketing of certain products or\nservices, or increase the costs of offering them to\ncustomers.\nJPMorganChase’s operations, results and reputation\ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events\nbeyond its control.\nJPMorganChase’s business and operational systems could\nbe seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be\nharmed, by events or contributing factors that are\nwholly or partially beyond its control, including\nmaterial instances of:\ncyber attacks\nsecurity breaches of its physical premises,\nincluding threats to health and safety\npower, telecommunications or internet outages, or\nshutdowns of mass transit\nfailure of, or loss of access to, technology or\noperational systems, including any resulting loss of\ncritical data\ninterruption of service from third-party service\nproviders\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of\nJPMorganChase or third parties, and any consequent\ninjuries, including in connection with any\nconstruction projects undertaken by JPMorganChase\neffects of climate change\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\naccidents such as explosions or structural failures\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\nevents arising from local or larger-scale civil or\npolitical unrest, any outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\nJPMorganChase operates a Firmwide resiliency framework\nthat is intended to enable it to prepare for and adapt\nto changing conditions and withstand and recover from,\nand address any adverse effects on its operations\ncaused by, disruptions that may impact critical\nbusiness functions and supporting assets, including\nits staff, technology, data and facilities and those\nof third-party service providers.\nAlthough not every form of disruption can be\nanticipated or defended against, JPMorganChase\n27",

There can be no assurance that\nJPMorganChase’s Firmwide resiliency framework will\nfully mitigate all potential resiliency risks to\nJPMorganChase, its clients, and customers and third\nparties with which it does business, or that its\nresiliency framework will be adequate to address the\neffects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple or\nextended disruption events. In addition,\nJPMorganChase’s ability to respond effectively to a\ndisruption event could be hampered to the extent that\nthe members of its workforce, physical assets, systems\nand other support infrastructure, or those of its\nthird-party service providers, that are needed to\naddress the event are geographically dispersed, or\nconversely, if such an event were to occur in an area\nin which they are concentrated. Further, should\nextraordinary events or the factors that cause or\ncontribute to those events become more chronic, the\ndisruptive effects of those events on JPMorganChase’s\nbusiness and operations, and on its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and employees, could become\nmore significant and long-lasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of\nJPMorganChase’s operations or operational systems, or\nthe occurrence of one or more extraordinary events\nthat are beyond its control, could:\nhinder JPMorganChase’s ability to provide services\nto its clients and customers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including\nfrom loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\ndisrupt market infrastructure systems on which\nJPMorganChase’s businesses rely\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\nharm its reputation.\nThe occurrence of one or more extraordinary events\ncould also negatively impact the financial condition\nor creditworthiness of JPMorganChase’s clients and\ncustomers, and could lead to an increase in\ndelinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit\nlosses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce\nJPMorganChase’s earnings.\nData quality is essential to JPMorganChase’s business\nand operations, and if JPMorganChase fails to maintain\nadequate data management processes, this could\nadversely affect its ability to effectively manage its\nbusinesses, comply with applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, or remain competitive.\nJPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and complete\ndata to effectively operate its systems and processes,\nincluding:\nassessing risk exposures and limits\nmonitoring and detecting fraudulent transactions and\ncyber threats\ndeveloping or maintaining models and other\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, including\nthose that use machine learning or artificial\nintelligence\nimplementing and maintaining compliance programs,\nand\npreparing financial statements, disclosures and\nregulatory reports, as well as internal reporting\nAny deficiencies in JPMorganChase’s data management\nprocesses, including with respect to the accuracy or\ncompleteness of data, the timeliness of data\ncollection, the analysis or validation of data, or the\nsafeguarding of data could undermine the reliability\nand effectiveness of its operations, including:\nrisk management practices, including inaccurate or\nuntimely risk reporting\ndelivery of regulatory reporting or internal or\nexternal financial reporting\ncompliance practices, such as those relating to\ntransaction monitoring, customer screening, blocking\nand rejecting transactions, recordkeeping or reporting\nbusiness activities, such as those related to\nmanaging JPMorganChase's market-making positions and\nliquidity and capital levels, including reliance on\ntimely data for informed decision-making\nproviding services to clients and customers,\nincluding transaction processing, lending services,\naccount management and customer support, or\nfraud detection and prevention processes.\nAny or all of these factors could impair the ability\nof JPMorganChase to make sound business decisions,\ncause it to incur higher operational and compliance\ncosts, result in operational breakdowns or failure to\nmeet its regulatory requirements, negatively affect\nclients and customers, or lead to reputational harm.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers can\nresult in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorganChase must comply with enhanced regulatory and\nother standards associated with doing\n28\nbusiness with vendors and other service providers,\nincluding standards relating to the outsourcing of\nfunctions as well as the performance of significant\nbanking and other functions by subsidiaries.\nJPMorganChase incurs significant costs and expenses in\nconnection with its initiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its internal and external\nservice providers. JPMorganChase’s failure to\nappropriately assess and manage these relationships,\nespecially those involving significant banking\nfunctions, shared services or other critical\nactivities, could materially adversely affect\nJPMorganChase. Specifically, any such failure could\nresult in:\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost\nrevenues\nincreased operational costs, or\nharm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s risk management framework and control\nenvironment will not be effective in identifying and\nmitigating every risk to JPMorganChase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorganChase’s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure, practices,\nmodels or reporting systems, or in its control\nenvironment, could expose it to unexpected losses, and\nits financial condition or results of operations could\nbe materially and adversely affected. Any such\ninadequacy or lapse could:\nhinder the timely escalation of material risk issues\nto JPMorganChase’s senior management and Board of\nDirectors\nlead to business decisions that have negative\noutcomes for JPMorganChase\nrequire significant resources and time to remediate\nlead to non-compliance with laws, rules and\nregulations\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\nexpose JPMorganChase to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nlead to potential harm to customers and clients, and\nany liability associated with that harm\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish confidence in JPMorganChase.\nMany of JPMorganChase’s risk management strategies and\ntechniques consider historical market behavior and to\nsome degree are based on management’s subjective\njudgment or assumptions. For example, many models used\nby JPMorganChase are based on assumptions regarding\nhistorical\ncorrelations among prices of various asset classes or\nother market indicators. In times of market stress,\nincluding difficult or less liquid market\nenvironments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic events could, in some circumstances, limit\nthe effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s risk management\nstrategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorganChase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations\nor judgments, including those used in its financial\nstatements, are inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorganChase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital, liquidity,\noperational and other risks. JPMorganChase also uses\ninternal models and estimations as a basis for its\nstress testing and in connection with the preparation\nof its financial statements under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of\nassumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The\nmodels and estimations that JPMorganChase uses,\nincluding those that use machine learning or\nartificial intelligence, may not be effective in all\ncases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a\nvariety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist\nin the future, including assumptions underlying the\nmodels and estimations such as correlations among\ncertain market indicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or\nmay not be indicative of severely negative market\nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or\nlack of liquidity\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices\nof certain loans and securities may make it more\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be\nwell understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models\nand estimations, and\n29",

For example, where quoted market prices\nare not available for certain financial instruments\nthat require a determination of their fair value,\nJPMorganChase may make fair value determinations based\non internally developed models or other means which\nultimately rely to some degree on management estimates\nand judgment. In addition, JPMorganChase may\nexperience increased uncertainty in its estimates if\nassets acquired differ from those used to develop\nthose models, which may lead to unexpected losses.\nSimilarly, JPMorganChase establishes an allowance for\nexpected credit losses related to its credit exposures\nwhich requires significant judgments, including\nforecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair\nthe ability of JPMorganChase’s clients and customers\nto repay their loans or other obligations. These types\nof estimates and judgments may not prove to be\naccurate due to a variety of factors, including when\nthe current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed. The\nincreased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree\nof judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments\nthat JPMorganChase may make to model outputs than\nwould otherwise be the case.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations used by JPMorganChase in managing\nrisks are subject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorganChase’s regulators. These reviews\nare required before JPMorganChase may use those models\nand estimations for calculating market risk RWA,\ncredit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel\nIII. If JPMorganChase’s models or estimations are not\napproved by its regulators, it may be subject to\nhigher capital charges, which could adversely affect\nits financial results or limit the ability to expand\nits businesses.\nLapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls over\ndisclosure or financial reporting could materially\naffect JPMorganChase’s profitability or reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations,\nboth within and outside the U.S., requiring continuous\nenhancements to various disclosures in its financial\nstatements and regulatory reports.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective\nin every circumstance, or that a material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency in internal control over\nfinancial reporting will not occur. Any such lapse,\nweakness or\ndeficiency could result in inaccurate financial\nreporting which, in turn, could:\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapse, weakness or deficiency\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish investor confidence in\nJPMorganChase.\nStrategic\nJPMorganChase’s results or competitive standing could\nsuffer if its management fails to develop and execute\neffective business strategies, and to anticipate\nchanges affecting those strategies.\nThe development and execution of effective business\nstrategies by JPMorganChase’s management, along with\nthe ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in the\ncompetitive environment, are critical to\nJPMorganChase's competitive standing and to achieving\nits strategic objectives. These strategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorganChase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\nthe counterparties with which it does business\nthe technologies that it adopts or in which it\ninvests, which may include new and currently unproven\ntechnologies, and\nthe methods, distribution channels and third party\nservice providers by or through which it offers\nproducts and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and\ngoals that prove to be incorrect, are based on\nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do\nnot accurately assess the competitive landscape and\nindustry trends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or the expectations\nof clients, customers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values and growth\nprospects of JPMorganChase’s businesses may suffer and\nits earnings could decline.\nJPMorganChase’s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective\nbusiness plans to address these strategic priorities,\nboth in the near term and over longer time horizons.\nManagement’s effectiveness in this regard will affect\n30\nJPMorganChase’s ability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term\nstability to enable JPMorganChase to build and invest\nin market-leading businesses, even in a highly\nstressed environment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\nappropriately assess and monitor principal\ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate\nJPMorganChase's business strategies\nconduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or effectively\nintegrate newly-acquired businesses\nappropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to climate and\nother ESG matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources and\ncapabilities necessary to grow and manage\nJPMorganChase’s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations.\nJPMorganChase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services\nindustry.\nJPMorganChase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to\nchanges in financial regulation, technological\nadvances, increased public scrutiny and changes in\neconomic conditions. JPMorganChase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global financial services\nindustry will continue to be intense. Competitors\ninclude:\nother banks and financial institutions\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\nfinance companies\ntechnology companies, and\nother non-bank firms that are engaged in providing\nsimilar as well as new products and services.\nJPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations. For example, aggressive\nor less disciplined lending practices by non-bank\ncompetitors could lead to a loss of market share for\ntraditional banks, and in an economic downturn could\nresult in instability in the financial services\nindustry and adversely impact other market\nparticipants, including JPMorganChase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were banking\nproducts. These advances have also allowed financial\ninstitutions and other companies to provide electronic\nand internet-based financial solutions, including\nelectronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,\nlending and other extensions of credit to consumers,\npayments processing and online automated algorithmic-\nbased investment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other products\nand services, including deposits and other traditional\nbanking products, could be significantly disrupted by\nthe use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies\nand other applications using secure distributed\nledgers, that may not require intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could require\nJPMorganChase to spend more to modify or adapt its\nproducts to attract and retain clients and customers\nor to match products and services offered by its\ncompetitors, including technology companies. In\naddition, new technologies may be used by customers,\nor breached or infiltrated by third parties, in\nunexpected ways, which can increase JPMorganChase’s\ncosts for complying with laws, rules and regulations\nthat apply to the offering of products and services\nthrough those technologies and reduce the income that\nJPMorganChase earns from providing products and\nservices through those technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on\nthe pricing for JPMorganChase’s products and services\nor may cause JPMorganChase to lose market share,\nparticularly with respect to traditional banking\nproducts. This competition may be based on quality and\nvariety of products and services offered, transaction\nexecution, innovation, reputation and price. The\nfailure of any of JPMorganChase’s businesses to meet\nthe expectations of clients and customers, whether due\nto general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or service,\nchanges in client and customer expectations or other\nfactors, could affect JPMorganChase’s ability to\nattract or retain clients and customers. Any such\nimpact could, in turn, reduce\n31",

Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorganChase to make additional capital\ninvestments in its businesses, or to extend more of\nits capital on behalf of its clients to remain\ncompetitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect\nJPMorganChase’s business and operations, both directly\nand as a result of impacts on its clients and\ncustomers.\nJPMorganChase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its business, and\nthe activities of its clients and customers, could be\nadversely affected by climate change. Climate change\ncould manifest as a financial risk to JPMorganChase\neither through changes in the physical climate or from\nthe process of transitioning to a lower-carbon\neconomy. Both physical risks and transition risks\nassociated with climate change could have negative\nimpacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness\nof JPMorganChase’s clients and customers, on\nJPMorganChase's exposure to affected companies and\nmarkets, and on the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s\nexisting business strategy with respect to its\noperations, clients and customers.\nPhysical risks include the increased frequency or\nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods,\nwildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in\nthe climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent\nchanges in precipitation levels, or increases in\naverage ambient temperatures. Potential adverse\nimpacts of climate-related physical risks to\nJPMorganChase, its clients or customers include:\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\nreduced availability or increased cost of insurance\nfor clients of JPMorganChase\ninterruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\npopulation migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\nTransition risks arise from the financial and economic\nconsequences of society’s shift towards a lower-carbon\neconomy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of\nnew technologies or changes in consumer preferences\ntowards low-carbon goods and services. These risks\ncould also be influenced by changes in the physical\nclimate. Potential adverse impacts of transition risks\nto JPMorganChase, its clients or customers include:\nsudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by\nchanges in climate policy\nincreased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as emission pricing and\naccelerated decarbonization policies\nnegative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\ndamage to JPMorganChase’s reputation, including due\nto any perception that its business practices are\ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\nClimate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and\nconflicts in the manner in which climate policy and\nfinancial regulations are implemented in the many\nregions where JPMorganChase operates, including\ninitiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation\nwith extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal\nmodels and estimations used in climate risk\nassessments have an increased level of uncertainty due\nto limited historical trend information and the\nabsence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive\ngreenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to\ninaccurate disclosures or financial reporting.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorganChase employees can harm\nclients and customers, impact market integrity, damage\nJPMorganChase’s reputation and trigger litigation and\nregulatory action.\nJPMorganChase’s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and other market and\nindustry participants, and with each other, every day.\nAll employees are expected to demonstrate values and\nexhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of\nJPMorganChase’s Code of Conduct and Business\nPrinciples. JPMorganChase endeavors to embed conduct\nrisk management throughout an employee’s life cycle,\nincluding recruiting, onboarding, training and\ndevelopment, and performance management. Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral component of\nJPMorganChase’s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in improper\nor illegal conduct in the past. These instances of\nmisconduct have resulted in litigation, and\nresolutions of governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred\nprosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and\nother civil or criminal sanctions. There is no\nassurance that further inappropriate or unlawful\nactions by employees have not occurred or will not\noccur, lead to a violation of the terms of these\nresolutions (and associated consequences), or that any\nsuch actions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\nJPMorganChase’s reputation could be harmed by, and\ncollateral consequences could result from, a failure\nby\n32\none or more employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorganChase’s expectations, policies\nand practices, including by acting in ways that harm\nclients, customers, other market participants,\nemployees or others. Some examples of this include:\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorganChase’s\nproducts or services\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or\nunauthorized trading\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\nfacilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting\nor financial disclosure treatment that may be subject\nto scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities,\nor where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not\nreflect the economic substance of the transaction\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants\nusing electronic communications channels that have\nnot been approved by JPMorganChase\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorganChase’s goal of fostering\nan inclusive workplace\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate\nJPMorganChase’s risk appetite to business performance\ngoals or employee compensation objectives, and\nmisappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorganChase, its clients and customers\nor third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more\nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with\nJPMorganChase’s expectations, policies or practices\ncould include litigation, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nAny of these proceedings or actions could result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, or lead to:\nfinancial losses\nincreased operational and compliance costs\ngreater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\nregulatory actions that require JPMorganChase to\nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its\nactivities\nthe need for significant oversight by\nJPMorganChase’s management\nloss of clients or customers, and\nharm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect\nto newly-acquired businesses if JPMorganChase fails to\nsuccessfully integrate employees of those businesses\nor any of those employees do not conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorganChase's expectations, policies\nand practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorganChase’s reputation could harm its\nbusinesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorganChase is critical to its\nability to attract and retain clients, customers,\ninvestors and employees. Damage to JPMorganChase’s\nreputation can therefore cause significant harm to\nJPMorganChase’s business and prospects, and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, including:\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory\nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or actions that are contrary\nto JPMorganChase’s goal of fostering an inclusive\nworkplace\nsecurity breaches, including as a result of cyber\nattacks\nfailure to safeguard client, customer or employee\ninformation\nfailure to manage risks associated with its client\nrelationships, or with transactions or business\nactivities in which JPMorganChase or its clients\nengage, including transactions or activities that may\nbe unpopular among one or more constituencies\nrapid and broad dissemination of misinformation and\ndisinformation across the media landscape, including\nsocial networking sites\nincorrect, biased or misleading results or content\ngenerated by artificial intelligence, leading to\nharmful outcomes, including discrimination in lending\npractices against vulnerable populations, fraud,\nmanipulation of customers, privacy breaches or\nintellectual property infringement\ndeficiencies or perceived failures in managing ESG-\nrelated initiatives, including modifying or failing to\nmeet publicly-announced targets\noperational failures\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nactions taken in executing regulatory and\ngovernmental requirements during a global or regional\nhealth emergency, spread of infectious disease,\nepidemic or pandemic\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or\nresolutions of these matters, and\nfailure or perceived failure to comply with laws,\nrules or regulations by JPMorganChase or its clients,\n33",

Furthermore, JPMorganChase's\nrelationships or ability to transact with clients and\ncustomers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies\nin jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase does business,\ncould be adversely affected if its decisions with\nrespect to doing business with companies in certain\nsensitive industries are perceived to harm those\ncompanies or to align with particular political\nviewpoints. The foregoing types of criticism can be\nmore widespread during election years in various\njurisdictions, and could have the effect of focusing\nattention on a company such as JPMorganChase as part\nof a wider public debate on public policy matters.\nFurthermore, JPMorganChase's participation in or\nassociation with certain environmental and social\nindustry groups or initiatives could be viewed by\nactivists or governmental authorities as boycotting or\nother discriminatory business behavior.\nThese and other types of criticism and actions\ndirected at JPMorganChase could potentially engender\ndissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors,\nemployees, government officials and other\nstakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorganChase’s\nreputation and its business and results of operations\ncould be harmed by:\ngreater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies, or further criticism from politicians and\nother members of the public, including in the form of\ngovernmental or regulatory investigations or\nlitigation\nunfavorable coverage or commentary in the media,\nincluding through social media campaigns\ncertain clients and customers ceasing doing business\nwith JPMorganChase, and encouraging others to do so\nimpairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to attract new\nclients and customers, to expand its relationships\nwith existing clients and customers, or to hire or\nretain employees, or\ncertain investors opting to divest from investments\nin securities of JPMorganChase.\nActions by the financial services industry generally\nor individuals in the industry can also affect\nJPMorganChase’s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged\nby concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial\ninstitution, or\na financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products to\ncustomers.\nIf JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in these\ntypes of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation\namong clients or customers, employees or other\nstakeholders.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of\ninterest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as well\nas damage JPMorganChase’s reputation.\nJPMorganChase’s ability to manage potential conflicts\nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which encompass a variety\nof transactions, obligations and interests with and\namong JPMorganChase’s clients and customers.\nJPMorganChase can become subject to litigation,\nenforcement actions, and heightened regulatory\nscrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the\nfailure or perceived failure to:\nadequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts\nof interest that may arise in connection with\nproviding multiple products and services in, or having\none or more investments related to, the same\ntransaction\nidentify and address any conflict of interest that a\nthird party with which it is does business may have\nwith respect to a transaction involving JPMorganChase\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\n34\ntreat clients and customers fairly and with the\nappropriate standard of care\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance\nwith the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or\nhandle or use confidential information of customers\nor clients appropriately and in compliance with\napplicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and\nregulations.\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations\ncould result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation\nand regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement\nactions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and\nhigher operating costs and cause serious harm to\nJPMorganChase’s reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the global economy and on\nJPMorganChase’s businesses within the affected region\nor globally.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups,\nincluding armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks,\ncould expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other\ncountries or escalating into full-scale war with\npotentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if\none or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons.\nDepending on the scope of the conflict, the\nhostilities could result in:\nworldwide economic disruption\nheightened volatility in financial markets\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\nsudden increases in prices in the energy and\ncommodity markets or for certain safe haven currencies\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\ndisruption of global trade\ndiminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence\nrefugee and humanitarian crises, and\nnew economic sanctions or other regulatory\nrequirements, including those that introduce\nexceptional compliance challenges for multinational\ncompanies such as JPMorganChase.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant\nnegative effects on JPMorganChase’s operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly\naffected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly involved in such a\nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any\noperations that JPMorganChase may have in the affected\ncountries or region, as well as in any nation that is\naligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorganChase could also experience more numerous and\naggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such\na conflict.\nJPMorganChase’s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorganChase conducts\nbusiness have economies or markets that are less\ndeveloped and more volatile or may have political,\nlegal and regulatory regimes that are less established\nor predictable than other countries in which\nJPMorganChase operates. In addition, in some\njurisdictions in which JPMorganChase conducts\nbusiness, the local economy and business activities\nare subject to substantial government influence or\ncontrol. Some of these countries have in the past\nexperienced economic disruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt and\nincreased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive\npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, such as:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets,\nincluding client assets, or confiscation of property,\nincluding intellectual property, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of\ngovernment actions can negatively affect\nJPMorganChase’s operations in the relevant country,\neither directly or by suppressing the business\nactivities of local clients or multi-national clients\nthat conduct business in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\n35",

In addition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect\nJPMorganChase’s operations and investments in another\ncountry or countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees is critical to its success.\nJPMorganChase’s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial services\nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorganChase endeavors to attract talented\nnew employees from a variety of backgrounds and\nretain, develop and motivate its existing employees.\nJPMorganChase's efforts to hire and retain talented\nemployees could be hindered by factors such as:\nthe emerging need for more-skilled workers in an\nevolving labor and workplace environment, including\ndue to changes in technology\ntargeted recruitment of JPMorganChase employees by\ncompetitors, and\nmodifications to or discontinuation of\nJPMorganChase's hybrid work models.\nJPMorganChase's performance and competitive position\ncould be materially and adversely affected if it is\nunable to attract or retain qualified employees for\nits workforce or to devise and execute effective\nsuccession planning for key leadership roles, such as\nthe Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating\nCommittee and other senior leaders.\nIn addition, advances in technology, such as\nautomation and artificial intelligence, may lead to\nworkforce displacement. This could require\nJPMorganChase to invest in additional employee\ntraining, manage impacts on morale and retention, and\ncompete for employment candidates who possess more\nadvanced technological skills, all of which could\nhave a negative impact on JPMorganChase's business and\noperations.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies\ncould adversely affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and\noperations.\nJPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the world.\nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S.\nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise\nmake it more difficult for employees or their family\nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between,\njurisdictions in which JPMorganChase has operations or\nconducts its business could inhibit JPMorganChase’s\nability to attract and retain qualified employees, and\nthereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could\nprompt JPMorganChase to make structural changes to its\nworldwide or regional operating models that cause its\noperations to be less efficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is otherwise\ninvolved in many legal proceedings, including class\nactions, derivative actions and other litigation or\ndisputes with third parties, as well as criminal\nproceedings. Actions currently pending against\nJPMorganChase may result in judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to\nJPMorganChase. Any of these matters could materially\nand adversely affect JPMorganChase’s business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations, or cause\nserious reputational harm. As a participant in the\nfinancial services industry, it is likely that\nJPMorganChase will continue to experience a high level\nof litigation and regulatory and government\ninvestigations related to its businesses and\noperations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nThere is no assurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other enforcement actions\nagainst JPMorganChase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law or regulation\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and officials in the\nU.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n36\nIn addition, if another financial institution violates\na law or regulation relating to a particular business\nactivity or practice, this will often give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other governmental\nagencies of the same or similar activity or practice\nby JPMorganChase.\nJPMorganChase could become subject to a significant\nregulatory investigation and be unable to disclose\nspecific information concerning that investigation to\nthe public if such a disclosure would violate\nJPMorganChase’s obligations under applicable rules and\nregulations to maintain the confidentiality of\nconfidential supervisory information, even if the\nresolution of that investigation could have a material\nadverse effect on JPMorganChase’s business,\noperations, results or financial condition.\nRegulatory investigations, examinations or other\ninitiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental\nauthorities may subject JPMorganChase to judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nmay require JPMorganChase to restructure its\noperations and activities or to cease offering certain\nproducts or services. All of these potential outcomes\ncould harm JPMorganChase’s reputation or lead to\nhigher operational costs, thereby reducing\nJPMorganChase’s profitability, or result in collateral\nconsequences. In addition, the extent of\nJPMorganChase’s exposure to legal and regulatory\nmatters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases,\nexceed the amount of reserves that JPMorganChase has\nestablished for those matters.\n37\nParts I and II",

Firmwide overview JPMorganChase reported net income of $58.5 billion for 2024, up 18%,\nearnings per share of $19.75, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 22%. • Total net revenue was $177.6 billion, up 12%,\nreflecting: – Net interest income (“NII”) of $92.6 billion, up 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet actions,\nprimarily reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, higher revolving balances in Card Services, the\ntiming impact of First Republic, higher wholesale deposit balances, and higher Markets net interest income, largely\noffset by deposit margin compression across the lines of business and lower average deposit balances in CCB. NII\nexcluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 3%. – Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $85.0 billion, up 23%, predominantly\ndriven by a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, higher asset\nmanagement fees in AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees, and lower net investment securities losses in\nTreasury and CIO. The prior year included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First\nRepublic.\n54    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNoninterest expense was $91.8 billion, up 5%, driven\nby higher compensation expense, including higher\nrevenue-related compensation and growth in the number\nof employees, as well as a $1.0 billion contribution\nof Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation\nrecorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially\noffset by lower FDIC-related expense, reflecting a\n$2.9 billion special assessment recognized in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, compared with a $725 million\nincrease to the FDIC special assessment recognized in\nthe first quarter of 2024.\nThe provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion,\nreflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-offs and a net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses of $2.0\nbillion. Net charge-offs increased by $2.4 billion,\ndriven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of\nvintages originated in recent years, credit\nnormalization, and balance growth. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses included a net\naddition of $2.1 billion in consumer , driven by Card\nServices, and a net reduction of $19 million in\nwholesale .\nThe provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion,\nreflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a $3.1\nbillion net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses.\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $26.9\nbillion at December 31, 2024.

Refer to Wholesale Credit\nPortfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages\n126–136 and pages 120–125, respectively, for\nadditional information.\nFirmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 6%,\ndriven by higher loans across the lines of business.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up\n1%, reflecting:\n– net inflows in Payments and net issuances of\nstructured notes in Markets,\n– the timing impact of First Republic, and\n– growth in balances in new and existing client\naccounts in AWM,\npredominantly offset by\n– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in\nbalances in existing accounts due to increased\ncustomer spending.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115\nfor additional information.\nSelected capital and other metrics\nCET1 capital was $275.5 billion, and the\nStandardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.7% and\n15.8%, respectively.\nSLR was 6.1%.\nTBVPS grew 13.0%, ending 2024 at $97.30.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm had eligible end-\nof-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of\napproximately $834 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $594\nbillion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

Principal transactions revenue\nincreased driven by CIB, reflecting: • higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives,\npredominantly offset by • lower Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting the net impact of declines in revenue\nacross macro businesses and higher revenue in Securitized Products. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally\nhas offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its\nMarkets business on a total net revenue basis. The increase in CIB was partially offset by a net decrease in\nCorporate, reflecting lower revenue in Treasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss on certain legacy\nprivate equity investments in the prior year. Refer to CIB segment and Corporate results on pages 77–83 and pages\n88–90, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased,\nreflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including cash management fees in Payments, on higher volume; and\nhigher lending-related fees, including loan commitment fees. These factors were largely offset by a decline in the\namortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First\nRepublic, primarily in AWM, as certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on\npages 77–83 and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management fees increased,\nreflecting, in AWM and CCB, higher average market levels and net inflows, as well as higher performance fees in\nAWM; and in CCB, the timing impact of First Republic. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 73–76 and pages\n84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    59\nCommissions and other fees increased, predominantly\ndue to higher brokerage commissions and fees on higher\nvolume, and higher custody fees, in both CIB and AWM,\nas well as higher annuity sales commissions in CCB.\nRefer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages\n73–76, pages 77–83 and pages 84–87, respectively, and\nNote 6 for additional information.\nInvestment securities losses decreased, reflecting\nlower losses on sales of securities, primarily U.S.\nTreasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,\nassociated with repositioning the investment\nsecurities portfolio in Treasury and CIO.

These factors were\nlargely offset by deposit margin compression across\nthe lines of business and lower average deposit\nbalances in CCB.\nThe Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5\ntrillion, up $212 billion, and the yield was 5.50%, up\n36 bps.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business\ndue to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and\nmarket conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources,\nand its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating\nliquidity needs. • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and higher securities borrowed, largely\noffset by net income. • In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, lower other assets, and accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, lower accounts payable and other\nliabilities, and higher securities borrowed.\nInvesting activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans,\ninvesting in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. • In 2024, cash used resulted\nfrom net purchases of investment securities, net loan originations and higher securities purchased under resale\nagreements, partially offset by proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. • In 2023,\ncash provided resulted from net proceeds from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of\nloans held-for-investment, and lower securities purchased under resale agreements, largely offset by net\noriginations of loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition. Financing activities The Firm’s\nfinancing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. • In 2024,\ncash provided primarily reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds\nfrom long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by net redemption of preferred stock. • In 2023, cash used\nreflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic\nBank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition,\npartially offset by higher securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term\nborrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and\npreferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 63–65, Capital Risk Management on\npages 97–107, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page\n176 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows.\n66    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE\nOF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 172–176. That\npresentation, which is referred to as “reported”\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results,\nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results\nof the lines of business on a managed basis. The\nFirm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each\ncase, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes\ncertain reclassifications to present total net revenue\nfor the Firm as a whole, and for each of the\nreportable business segments and Corporate, on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that\nreceive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable\nto taxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures\nallow management to assess the comparability of\nrevenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax\nimpact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within\nincome tax expense. These adjustments have no impact\non net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by\neach of the lines of business and Corporate.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment levels\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the underlying\noperational performance and trends of the Firm or of\nthe particular business segment, as the case may be,\nand therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or\nthe business segment with the performance of its\nrelevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment &\nCorporate Results on pages 70–90 for additional\ninformation on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by the Firm may not be\ncomparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies.\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation\nfrom the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed\nbasis.\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…                         F…                                     F…                               F…\n…       2…                t…                M…        …          t…            M…                 t…       …\n…       R…                a…                b…        …          a…    …       b…        …        a…       …\n…    $  1…       -a    $  2…        …    $  1…     $  …       $  3…         $  9…     $  …     $  3…    $  …\n…\n…\n…       8…                2…                8…        …          3…            7…        …        3…       …\n…\n…\n…       9…                4…                9…        …          4…            8…        …        4…       …\n…\n…\n…       1…                3…                1…        …          4…            1…        …        3…       …\n…\n…\n…       9…                    NA            9…        …          NA            8…        …        NA       …\n…\n…       8…                3…                8…        …          4…            7…        …        3…       …\n…\n…\n…       1…                    NA            1…        …          NA            9…        …        NA       …\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…       7…                3…                7…        …          4…            6…        …        3…       …\n…\n…\n…\n…       1…       -a       3…        …       1…        …          4…            1…        …        3…       …\n…\n…    $  5…                    NA         $  5…     $  …          NA         $  4…     $  …        NA    $  …\n…\n…       52  %                 NM            51  %     …  %       NM            54  %     …  %     NM       …  %\n…\n(a) Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures\nguidance, under the modified retrospective method.

Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable\nbusiness segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to\nform one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the reorganization, the Firm\nhas three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &\nWealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served,\nand they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose\nmembers act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed\nbasis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 67–69 for\na definition of managed basis.\nThe following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management reporting process\nthat derives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements\nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on\nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to\nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating\nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those\ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segments or\nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment\nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n70    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nExpense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by\nCorporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments\nrelated to Corporate that are not currently utilized\nby any LOB are not allocated to the business segments\nand are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in\nCorporate generally includes costs that would not be\nincurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses,\nand other items not solely aligned with a particular\nreportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the\nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and\nCIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the segments.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm\nupdated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits,\nwhich resulted in an increase in the funding benefit\nreflected within CCB’s net interest income that is\nfully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the\nFirm’s net interest income.\nAs a result of higher average interest rates, the cost\nof funds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for\nliabilities have generally increased in the current\nyear, impacting the net interest income of the\nbusiness segments. During the period ended December\n31, 2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds\nfor loans and Markets activities. In addition, rates\npaid to deposit holders increased more than the FTP\nbenefit increase during the year, resulting in deposit\nmargin compression.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses.

Refer to Market Risk Management\non page 149 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of\nthe credit spread component of outstanding unsecured\nlong-term debt and preferred stock dividends is\nallocated to the reportable business segments, while\nthe balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The\nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-\nterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the\nbusiness segments is aligned with the relevant\nregulatory capital requirements and funding needs of\nthe LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of\nunsecured long-term debt is included in a business\nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is\nreduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a\nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common\nequity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages\n97–107 for additional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and\nCorporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current\nequity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the\nglobal systemically important banks (“GSIB”)\nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as\nwell as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe\nstress environment. At least annually, the\nassumptions, judgments and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may\nchange. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity\non page 104 for additional information on capital\nallocation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    71\nSegment & Corporate Results – Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by business segments and Corporate for the periods indicated.\n…                     …                           …\n&                     &                           &\n…                     …                           …\n…  …          …       …  …               2…       …  2…          2…                …         …         …\n$     …    $     …    $     …    …    $  …        $     6…    $     5…    …    $  2…     $      …  $      …\n…          …          …    …       …              3…          3…    …       1…            …         …\n…          …          …            …              3…          2…            7…            …         …\n…          …          …            …              2…          2…            -…            …         …\n…          …          …    …       …              2…          1…    …       5…            …         …\n…  %       …  %       …  %            …  %        …   %       …   %            34  %     31  %     25  %\nYear\nend…\nDec…\n31,\n(in\nmil…\nexc…\nrat…       Corp…   2024                2023        2022       Total   2024                   2023          2022\nTot…\nnet     $         17,3…    -b    $    8,038  $       80    $         180,…    -b    $      162,3…  $      132,…\nrev…\nTot…\nnon…              3,994    -c         5,601       1,034              91,7…    -c           87,172         76,1…\nexp…\nPre…              13,4…               2,437        -954              88,7…                 75,194         56,1…\npro…\nPro…\nfor                  10                 171          22              10,6…                  9,320         6,389\ncre…\nlos…\nNet               10,6…               2,821        -743              58,4…                 49,552         37,6…\ninc…\nRet…\non                   NM                  NM          NM          18      %             17       %     14      %\nequ…\n(“R…\n(a) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services\nrevenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB.

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.\nMarkets revenue consists of principal transactions,\nfees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets\nbusiness performance on a total revenue basis, as\noffsets generally occur across revenue line items. For\nexample, securities that generate net interest income\nmay be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected\nat fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer\nto Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition\nof these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise\nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal\ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon\nexecuting new transactions with market participants,\nas well as “inventory-related revenue,” which is\nrevenue recognized from gains and losses on\nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to,\nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments\nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure\narising from such inventory. Principal transactions\nrevenue recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants is affected by many factors\nincluding the level of client activity, the bid-offer\nspread (which is the difference between the price at\nwhich a market participant is willing and able to sell\nan instrument to the Firm and the price at which\nanother market participant is willing and able to buy\nit from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity\nand volatility. These factors are interrelated and\nsensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market\nconditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity\nprices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    81\nFor the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized\nupon executing new transactions.\nYe…\nen…\nDe…\n31,\n(in\nmi…\nex…       2024                                2023                                2022\nwh…       Fix…                                Fix…                                Fix…\not…       Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…\nno…       Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…\nPr…    $  10,…    $  13,…    $  24,…       $  13,…    $  10,…    $  23,…       $  12,…    $  8,2…    $  20,…\ntr…\nLe…\nand        391        100        491           307         40        347           303         22        325\nde…\nfe…\nCo…\nand        605       2,0…       2,6…           596       1,9…       2,5…           550       1,9…       2,5…\not…\nfe…\nAll\not…       2,1…        -65       2,0…          1,9…        -79       1,8…          1,0…        -88        995\nin…\nNo…       13,…       15,…       29,…          16,…       12,…       28,…          14,…       10,…       24,…\nre…\nNet\nin…       6,3…       -5,…        641          3,1…       -3,…       -294          4,8…       -105       4,7…\nin…\nTo…\nnet    $  20,…    $  9,9…    $  30,…       $  19,…    $  8,7…    $  27,…       $  19,…    $  10,…    $  29,…\nre…\nLo…                                   1                                   2                                   7\nda…\n(a) The decline in Equity Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.\n(b) Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.

The discount is deferred in other liabilities and recognized on a straight-line basis over the\ncommitment period and was largely recognized in 2023 as the commitments were generally short term. Refer to Note 34\nfor additional information. (b) Includes the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s\nacquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.\n2024 compared with 2023 Net income was $5.4 billion, up 4%. Net revenue was $21.6 billion, up 9%. Net interest\nincome was $6.6 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue was $15.0 billion, up 11%. Revenue from Asset Management was\n$10.2 billion, up 11%, driven by: • higher asset management fees, reflecting higher average market levels and\nstrong net inflows, as well as • higher performance fees. The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the\noriginal minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity. Revenue\nfrom Global Private Bank was $11.4 billion, up 7%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue, reflecting: – higher\nmanagement fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage fees, partially\noffset by – a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related\ncommitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest income driven by: – higher\naverage deposits associated with First Republic, which were transferred to AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of\n2023, as well as wider spreads on loans and higher average loans, largely offset by – deposit margin compression\nreflecting higher rates paid. The prior year included net investment valuation losses. Noninterest expense was\n$14.4 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by: • higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and\ncontinued growth in private banking advisor teams, and • higher distribution fees and legal expense, The provision\nfor credit losses was a net benefit of $68 million. The provision in the prior year was $159 million, reflecting a\n$146 million addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans\nand lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n84    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nAsset Management has two high-level measures of\nits overall fund performance.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF\nassets under management in funds rated 4- or\n5-star:\nMutual fund rating services rank funds based on\ntheir risk adjusted performance over various\nperiods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating\nrepresents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is\nthe worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar\nrating is derived from a weighted average of the\nperformance associated with a fund’s three-, five\nand ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating\nmetrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star\nratings are provided at the individual share class\nlevel. The Nomura “star rating” is based on\nthree-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds\nwith fewer than three years of history are not\nrated and hence excluded from these rankings. All\nratings, the assigned peer categories and the\nasset values used to derive these rankings are\nsourced from the applicable fund rating provider.\nWhere applicable, the fund rating providers\nredenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at\na “primary share class” level to represent the\nstar rating of all other funds, except for Japan,\nfor which Nomura provides ratings at the fund\nlevel. The performance data may have been\ndifferent if all share classes had been included.\nPast performance is not indicative of future\nresults.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF\nassets under management in funds ranked in the 1st\nor 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):\nAll quartile rankings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive\nthese rankings are sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based on the\nnet-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on fund performance and associated\npeer rankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class”\nlevel to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds. The performance data\nmay have been different if all share classes had\nbeen included. Past performance is not indicative\nof future results.\n“Primary share class” means the C share class for\nEuropean funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong\nSAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are\nnot available, the oldest share class is used as\nthe primary share class.\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except ranking data, ratios and\nemployees)                                                      2024             2023                   2022\n% of JPM mutual fund assets and ETFs                              69  %            69  %                  73  %\nrated as 4- or 5-star(a)\n% of JPM mutual fund assets and ETFs ranked in 1stor\n2nd\nquartile:(b)\n1 year                                                            73               40                     68\n3 years                                                           75               67                     76\n5 years                                                           77               71                     81\nSelected balance sheet data\n(period-end)(c)\nTotal assets                                              $  255,385       $  245,512             $  232,037\nLoans                                                        236,303          227,929                214,006\nDeposits                                                     248,287          233,232       -d       233,130\nEquity                                                        15,500           17,000                 17,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)(c)\nTotal assets                                              $  246,254       $  240,222             $  232,438\nLoans                                                        227,676          220,487                215,582\nDeposits                                                     235,146          216,178       -d       261,489\nEquity                                                        15,500           16,671                 17,000\nEmployees                                                     29,403           28,485                 26,041\nNumber of Global Private Bank client                           3,775            3,515                  3,137\nadvisors\nCredit data and quality statistics(c)\nNet charge-offs/(recoveries)                              $       21       $       13             $       -7\nNonaccrual loans                                                 700              650                    459\nAllowance for credit losses:\nAllowance for loan losses                                 $      539       $      633             $      494\nAllowance for lending-related                                     35               28                     20\ncommitments\nTotal allowance for credit losses                         $      574       $      661             $      514\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate                                  0.01  %          0.01  %                   —  %\nAllowance for loan losses to period-end                         0.23             0.28                   0.23\nloans\nAllowance for loan losses to nonaccrual                           77               97                    108\nloans\nNonaccrual loans to period-end loans                            0.30             0.29                   0.21\n(a) Represents the Morningstar Rating for all\ndomiciled funds except for Japan domiciled funds which\nuse Nomura.

The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its business, and the associated risks, in a\nmanner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data\nand management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;\nand\nA Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal governance\nand independent oversight by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm’s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks and\nimpacts of risks.\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include the economic\nenvironment, regulatory or government policy,\ncompetitor or market evolution, business decisions,\nprocess or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets and natural disasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest\nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized\nin the following four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly-\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal\nor a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk\nand investment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nrisk includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct,\nlegal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences when risks manifest themselves, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings\nand capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to\nthe Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers,\nand regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s\nChief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and approval\nof the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the\nFirmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk\nOfficers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and\nthe Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in\nturn, establish Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance\npolicies and standards, and define and oversee the\nimplementation of the Firm’s risk governance\nframework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in\ntheir LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks\nthat span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as\nfunctions and regions. Each area of the Firm that\ngives rise to risk is expected to operate within the\nparameters identified by the IRM function, and within\nthe risk and control standards established by its own\nmanagement.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    91\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management. The first line of\ndefense owns the risks, and identification of risks,\nassociated with their respective activities and the\ndesign and execution of controls to manage those\nrisks. Responsibilities also include adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementation of the risk governance framework\nestablished by IRM, which may include policies,\nstandards, limits, thresholds and controls.\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which\nis separate from the first line of defense and is\nresponsible for independently measuring risk, as well\nas assessing and challenging the risk management\nactivities of the first line of defense. IRM is also\nresponsible for the identification of risks within its\norganization, its own adherence to applicable laws,\nrules and regulations and for the development and\nimplementation of policies and standards with respect\nto its own processes.\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an\nindependent function that provides objective\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of\nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk\nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is led by the\nGeneral Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee\nand administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute\nto the Firmwide control environment but are not\nconsidered part of a particular line of defense,\nincluding Corporate Finance, Human Resources and\nLegal. These other functions are responsible for the\nidentification of risks within their respective\norganizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and\nregulations and implementation of the risk governance\nframework established by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification of risks within their respective\norganizations, as well as the design and execution of\ncontrols, including IRM-specified controls, to manage\nthose risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a\nrisk identification framework designed to facilitate\nthe responsibility of each LOB and Corporate to\nidentify material risks inherent to the Firm’s\nbusinesses and operational activities, catalog them in\na central repository and review material risks on a\nregular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges\nthe risks identified by each LOB and Corporate,\nmaintains the central repository and provides the\nconsolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk\nCommittee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by\nRisk Appetite frameworks for quantitative and\nqualitative risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is\nperiodically set and approved by senior management\n(including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board\nRisk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are\nassessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to\ntake risk consistent with its stated risk appetite.\nRisk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\n92    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is\nsupported by a risk governance and oversight structure\nthat provides channels for the escalation of risks and\nissues to senior management, the FRC and the Board of\nDirectors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the principal standing\ncommittees of the Board of Directors and key senior\nmanagement-level committees in the Firm’s risk\ngovernance and oversight structure. In addition, there\nare other committees, forums and channels of\nescalation that support the oversight of risk that are\nnot shown in the chart below or described in this Form\n10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the\nFirm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),\nGeneral Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior\nexecutives, is accountable to and may refer matters to\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee\nand certain other members of senior management are\nresponsible for escalating to the Board the\ninformation necessary to facilitate the Board’s\nexercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm. This includes\nmonitoring the Firm’s financial performance and\ncondition and reviewing the strategic objectives and\nplans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant\nportion of its oversight responsibilities through its\nprincipal standing committees, each of which consists\nsolely of independent members of the Board. The Board\nRisk Committee is the principal committee that\noversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees\nthe control environment, and the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee oversees compensation\nand other management-related\nmatters. Each committee of the Board oversees\nreputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental,\nsocial and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope\nof responsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is\nresponsible for the oversight of management of the\nbank, which it discharges both acting directly and\nthrough the principal standing committees of the\nFirm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight\non behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Board Risk Committee and the\nAudit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to\ncompensation and other management-related matters, the\nCompensation & Management Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its\noversight of management’s responsibility to implement\na global risk management framework reasonably designed\nto identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The\nBoard Risk Committee’s responsibilities include\napproval of applicable primary risk policies and\nreview of certain associated frameworks, analysis and\nreporting established by\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    93\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nmanagement. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters,\nissues that may have a material adverse impact on the\nFirm, including capital and liquidity issues, and\nother significant risk-related matters are escalated\nto the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight\nof management’s responsibilities to ensure that there\nis an effective system of controls reasonably designed\nto safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the\nintegrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and\nmaintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and with laws and\nregulations. It also assists the Board in its\noversight of the qualifications, independence and\nperformance of the Firm’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, and of the performance of the\nFirm’s Internal Audit function.\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee\n(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the\nFirm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC\nreviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and\nqualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the\nperformance of Operating Committee members against\ntheir goals, and approves their compensation awards.\nIn addition, the CEO’s compensation award is subject\nto ratification by the independent directors of the\nBoard. The CMDC also reviews the development of and\nsuccession for key executives. As part of the Board’s\nrole of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating\nthe “tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s\nculture, including reviewing updates from management\nregarding significant conduct issues and any related\nactions with respect to employees, including\ncompensation actions.\nThe Public Responsibility Committee oversees and\nreviews the Firm's positions and practices on public\nresponsibility matters such as community investment,\nfair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and\nother public policy issues that reflect the Firm's\nvalues and character and could impact the Firm's\nreputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also\nprovides guidance on these matters to management and\nthe Board, as appropriate.\nThe Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee\nexercises general oversight with respect to the\ngovernance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the\nqualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed\nnominees for election to the Board. The Committee\nevaluates and recommends to the Board corporate\ngovernance practices applicable to the Firm. It also\nreviews the framework for assessing the Board’s\nperformance and self-evaluation.\nManagement oversight\nThe Firm’s senior management-level committees that are\nprimarily responsible for key risk-related functions\ninclude:\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s\nhighest management-level risk committee. It oversees\nthe risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides\na forum for discussion of risk-related and other\ntopics and issues that are raised or escalated by its\nmembers and other committees.\nThe Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an\nescalation committee for senior management to review\nand discuss the Firmwide compliance and operational\nrisk environment, including identified issues,\ncompliance and operational risk metrics and\nsignificant events that have been escalated.\nLine of Business and Regional Risk Committees are\nresponsible for overseeing the governance, limits and\ncontrols that have been established within the scope\nof their respective activities. These committees\nreview the ways in which the particular LOB or the\nbusinesses operating in a particular region could be\nexposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on\nidentifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring\nremediation of matters brought to these committees.\n94    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the risk and control environment\nof their respective business or function, inclusive of\nOperational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As\npart of that mandate, they are responsible for\nreviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and\nother data that may impact the level of compliance and\noperational risk in a business or function, addressing\nkey compliance and operational risk issues , with an\nemphasis on processes with control concerns, and\noverseeing control remediation. The Asset and\nLiability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for\noverseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management\n(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks\nsupporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity\nrisk, interest rate risk and capital risk. The\nFirmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities conducted across the\nFirm. Risk governance and oversight functions The Firm\nmonitors and measures its risk through risk governance\nand oversight functions. The scope of a particular\nfunction or business activity may include one or more\ndrivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example,\nCountry Risk Management oversees country risk which\nmay be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures\nthat could give rise to multiple risk types such as\ncredit or market risk. The following sections discuss\nthe risk governance and oversight functions that have\nbeen established to oversee the risks inherent in the\nFirm’s business activities.\nRisk governance and oversight functions       Page\nStrategic Risk                                  96\nCapital Risk                                97–107\nLiquidity Risk                             108-115\nReputation Risk                                116\nConsumer Credit Risk                       120-125\nWholesale Credit Risk                      126-136\nInvestment Portfolio Risk                      140\nMarket Risk                                141-149\nCountry Risk                               150-151\nClimate Risk                                   152\nOperational Risk                           153-156\nCompliance Risk                                157\nConduct Risk                                   158\nLegal Risk                                     159\nEstimations and Model Risk                     160\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    95\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nSTRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly-\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nManagement and oversight\nThe Operating Committee, together with the senior\nleadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible\nfor managing the Firm’s most significant strategic\nrisks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business\ndiscussions and decision-making, including\nparticipation in relevant business reviews and senior\nmanagement meetings, risk and control committees and\nother relevant governance forums, and review of\nacquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board\nof Directors oversees management’s strategic\ndecisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM\nand the Firm’s risk governance framework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and\nstrategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement identify the associated risks that are\nincorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification\nframework and their impact on risk appetite.\nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of\nthe LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess\ntheir impact on the risk profile of the Firm.\nThe Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes\nthe development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other\nstrategic initiatives, is one component of managing\nthe Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines\nthe Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and\nincludes components such as budget, risk appetite,\ncapital, earnings and asset-liability management\nobjectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles,\nthe Operating Committee and senior management teams in\neach LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic\nplan periodically, including evaluating the strategic\nframework and performance of strategic initiatives,\nassessing the operating environment, refining existing\nstrategies and developing new strategies.\nThe Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s\nassessment, are provided to the Board as part of its\nreview and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and\nthe plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.\nThe Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on\nrisk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust\nliquidity, is also a component in the management of\nstrategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 97–107 for further information on capital risk.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115\nfor further information on liquidity risk. Refer to\nReputation Risk Management on page 116 for further\ninformation on reputation risk.\n96    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCapital risk is the risk that the Firm has an\ninsufficient level or composition of capital to\nsupport the Firm’s business activities and associated\nrisks during normal economic environments and under\nstressed conditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s\nbusiness strategy and competitive position.\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through\neconomic volatility is a strategic imperative of the\nFirm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating\nCommittee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet”\nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong\ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk\nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-term\nstability to enable the Firm to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly\nstressed environments. Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm’s capital prior to making\nsignificant decisions that could impact future\nbusiness activities. In addition to considering the\nFirm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates\nall sources and uses of capital with a view to\nensuring the Firm’s capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose\nprimary objective is to provide independent oversight\nof capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital\nrisk limits and indicators, including capital risk\nappetite;\nDeveloping processes to classify, monitor and report\ncapital limit breaches;\nPerforming assessments of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement activities, including changes made to the\nContingency Capital Plan described below; and\nConducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory\ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance with\napplicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital\nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to\nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through\nnormal economic cycles and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future\ninvestment opportunities;\nPromote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a\nsource of strength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its principal\ninsured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under\napplicable regulatory capital requirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate\nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with the\nFirm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements\nand maintaining a strong capital governance framework.\nThe internal minimum capital levels consider the\nFirm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an\ninternal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal\neconomic cycles and in stress events;\nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range\nof potential events; and\nRegularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and\nfollowing prescribed escalation protocols, both at the\nFirm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\ncapital management include the Capital Governance\nCommittee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional\nALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”)\nRisk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk\ntolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages\n91–95 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO\nand other risk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank\nHolding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually a\ncapital plan that has been reviewed and approved by\nthe Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and\nother stress testing processes to assess whether large\nBHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during\nperiods of economic and financial stress, and have\nrobust, forward-looking capital assessment and\nplanning processes in place that address each BHC’s\nunique risks to enable it to absorb losses under\ncertain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal\nReserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and\ninternal capital adequacy assessment processes\n(“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital\ndistributions, such as dividend payments or stock\nrepurchases. The Federal\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    97\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nReserve uses results under the severely adverse\nscenario from its supervisory stress test to determine\neach firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement\nfor the coming year.\nThe Firm's current SCB requirement is 3.3% and will\nremain in effect until September 30, 2025. The Firm’s\nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including\nregulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 105 for information\non actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs\nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of\nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses\nof capital as well as compliance with supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing\nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving\nthe capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and\nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined\ncentrally and applied uniformly across the businesses.\nThese scenarios are articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of\nbusiness results; global market shocks, which generate\nshort-term but severe trading losses; and\nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios\nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition\nto CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management\nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and\nsensitivity analyses, as necessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s\napproach towards capital management in normal economic\nconditions and in stressed environments. The\nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm\ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing\nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and\nsets out the capital contingency actions that are\nexpected to be taken or considered at various levels\nof capital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as\na consolidated financial holding company. The Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes\nsimilar minimum capital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally\nfollow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as\namended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards\nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and\nbanks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that\nmust be held by BHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to\nrisk. Under the rules currently in effect, two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for\ncalculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III\nStandardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III\nAdvanced”).\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the\nlower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements.\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital\nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and\nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III\nAdvanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-\nsensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of\ninternal credit models and parameters, whereas for\nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally\nbased on supervisory risk-weightings which vary\nprimarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market\nrisk RWA is generally calculated consistently between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In\naddition to the RWA calculated under these approaches,\nthe Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate\nmanagement judgment and feedback from its regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III\nStandardized ratios risk-based ratios were more\nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\ncalculate their SLRs.\nRefer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.\n98    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nKey Regulatory Developments\nU.S. Basel III Finalization\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule:\nAmendments applicable to large banking organizations\nand to banking organizations with significant trading\nactivity\", which is referred to in this Form 10-K as\nthe \"U.S. Basel III proposal\". Under this proposal,\nchanges to the framework would include replacement of\nthe Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based\napproach for the calculation of RWA. In addition, the\nstress capital buffer requirement would be applicable\nto both the expanded risk-based approach and the\nStandardized approach.\nGSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a proposal\nto amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Under\nthe proposal, the annual GSIB surcharge would be based\non an average of the quarterly surcharge calculations\nthroughout the calendar year, with daily averaging\nrequired for certain measures. The proposal would also\nreduce surcharge increments from 50 bps to 10 bps and\nincludes other technical amendments to the “Method 2”\ncalculation. The proposed changes would revise risk-\nbased capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S.\nGSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital Regulatory\nRequirements on page 100 for further information on\nthe GSIB surcharge.\nAdditionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the\nFDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the\neligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean\nholding company requirements under the existing total\nloss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-\nGSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total\nconsolidated assets. The proposal would also reduce\nthe amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less\nthan two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC\nrequirement and expand the existing capital deduction\nframework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD\nissued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD\nrequirements.\nFinalization of the above proposals, including the\nrequired implementation dates, is uncertain. The Firm\ncontinues to monitor developments and potential\nimpacts.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    99\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1\ncapital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are required to hold additional\nlevels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation\nbuffer”. The capital conservation buffer incorporates\na GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical\ncapital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer\nof 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements,\nas well as a variable SCB requirement, floored at\n2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital\nrequirements. Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule,\nthe Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on\nan annual basis under two separately prescribed\nmethods based on data for the previous fiscal year-\nend, and is subject to the higher of the two. “Method\n1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is\ncalculated across five criteria: size, cross-\njurisdictional activity, interconnectedness,\ncomplexity and substitutability. “Method 2” modifies\nthe Method 1 requirements to include a measure of\nshort-term wholesale funding in place of\nsubstitutability, and introduces a GSIB score\n“multiplication factor”. The following table presents\nthe Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge for the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For 2025, the Firm’s\neffective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge calculated\nunder both\nMethod 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5% and\n4.5%, respectively.\n2024         2023\nMethod 1    2.5     %    2.5     %\nMethod 2    4.5     %    4.0     %\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include\na framework for setting a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer taking into account the\nmacro financial environment in which large,\ninternationally active banks function. As of December\n31, 2024, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer\nremained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to\nreview the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be\nincreased if the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC\ndetermine that systemic risks are meaningfully above\nnormal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5%\nof RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.\nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in\nexcess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum\nplus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the\nGSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will\nresult in limitations to the amount of capital that\nthe Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and\ncommon share repurchases, as well as on discretionary\nbonus payments for certain executive officers.\n100    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nThe Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB\ntop-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to\nmaintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible\nLTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106 for additional\ninformation.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nSupplementary leverage ratio\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III\nAdvanced approach are currently required to have a\nminimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an\nadditional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as\nTier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s\ntotal leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is\ncalculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-\nbalance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be\ndeducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory\ncapital rules. Refer to SLR on page 104 for additional\ninformation.\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than\nthe regulatory requirement will result in limitations\non the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute\nsuch as through dividends and common share\nrepurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus\npayments for certain executive officers.\nOther regulatory capital\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements\nof Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI\nsubsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., must also\nmaintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order\nto be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued\nby the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective\nAction requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional\ninformation.\nAdditional information regarding the Firm’s capital\nratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital\nstandards to which the Firm is subject, is presented\nin Note 27.

Line of business and Corporate\nequity Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by\ntaking into consideration a variety of factors\nincluding capital levels of similarly rated peers and\napplicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is\nmeasured and internal targets for expected returns are\nestablished as key measures of an LOB’s performance.\nThe Firm’s current equity allocation methodology\nincorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB\nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as\nwell as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe\nstress environment. At least annually, the\nassumptions, judgments and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may\nchange. As of January 1, 2025, changes to the Firm’s\ncapital allocations are primarily a result of updates\nto the Firm’s current capital requirements and changes\nin RWA for each LOB under rules currently in effect.\nAny capital that the Firm has accumulated in excess of\nthese current requirements, including the capital\nrequired to meet the potential increased requirements\nof the U.S. Basel III proposal, has been retained in\nCorporate in addition to its allocated balance.

The $30\nbillion common share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors does not establish specific price\ntargets or timetables. Management determines the amount and timing of common share repurchases based on various\nfactors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of\nrepurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital\ngeneration; current and proposed future capital requirements; and other investment opportunities. The amount of\ncommon shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially more or less than the amounts estimated\nor actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the decision-making process. The Firm’s\ncommon share repurchases may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans\nthat the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which\nallow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common\nshares — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Refer to Firmwide Risk\nManagement on pages 91–95 for further discussion of\nALCO and other risk-related committees.\nInternal stress testing\nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to\nmonitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its\nmaterial legal entities under a variety of adverse\nscenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the\nFirm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal\nstress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other\nstress tests are performed in response to specific\nmarket events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests\nassume all of the Firm’s contractual financial\nobligations are met and take into consideration:\nVarying levels of access to unsecured and secured\nfunding markets;\nEstimated non-contractual and contingent cash\noutflows;\nCredit rating downgrades;\nCollateral haircuts; and\nPotential impediments to the availability and\ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and\nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or\nother restrictions.\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time\nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both\nmarket and idiosyncratic stresses.\nResults of stress tests are considered in the\nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment\nof its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as\na source of funding for the Firm through equity and\n108    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nlong-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding\ncompany, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”),\nprovides funding to support the ongoing operations of\nthe Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm\nmanages liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and\noperating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply\nwith liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity\nrequirements, and to manage through periods of stress\nwhen access to normal funding sources may be\ndisrupted. Contingency funding plan The Firm’s\nContingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the\nstrategies for addressing and managing liquidity\nresource needs during a liquidity stress event and\nincorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and\nrisk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the\nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires\nthat the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain\nan amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet\ntheir respective estimated total net cash outflows\nover a prospective 30 calendar-day period of\nsignificant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered\nHQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations\nas defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-\nbank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows\nare based on standardized stress outflow and inflow\nrates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds,\nand obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum\nof 100%.\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months\nended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 based on the Firm’s interpretation\nof the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                    Three months ended\n(in millions)                      December 31, 2024        September 30, 2024        December 31, 2023\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)               $             396,123     $             412,389     $            485,263\nEligible securities(b)(c)                    464,877                   453,899                  313,365\nTotal HQLA(d)                  $             861,000     $             866,288     $            798,628\nNet cash outflows              $             763,648     $             762,072     $            704,857\nLCR                                              113  %                    114  %                   113  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              97,352     $             104,216     $             93,771\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR                                              124  %                    121  %                   129  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA       $             193,682     $             168,137     $            215,190\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months\nended December 31, 2024 decreased compared with the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023, driven by\ndividend payments to the Parent Company and lending\nactivity, largely offset by higher market values of\nHQLA-eligible investment securities, a reduction in\nunencumbered non-HQLA AFS securities, activities in\nCIB Markets, and long-term debt issuances.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    109\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nEach of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to\nchanges in their respective eligible HQLA and\nestimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing\nbusiness activity and from the impacts of Federal\nReserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to the\nFirm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are\navailable on the Firm’s website, for a further\ndiscussion of the Firm’s LCR.\nLiquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be\navailable to raise liquidity. This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $594\nbillion and $649 billion as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, although the amount of liquidity\nthat could be raised at any particular time would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The\ndecrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by\nreductions in unencumbered AFS securities in Treasury\nand CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB trading assets.\nThe Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available\ncash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and\n2023. For each respective period, the amount was\ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding\nthe impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately\n$834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $594 billion and $649 billion.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of\ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of\napproximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This\nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and\nsecurities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or\nother unencumbered securities that are currently\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window\nand other central banks. Available borrowing capacity\nincreased from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a\nhigher amount of commercial loans and credit card\nreceivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks.\nAlthough available, the Firm does not view this\nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks\ndiscount window and the other central banks as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required”\namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with\nthe 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s\ninterpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the\nFirm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on the Firm’s\nwebsite for additional information.\n110    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including deposits, secured\nand unsecured funding in the capital markets and\nstockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding\nsource for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through\nshort- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance\nof unsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term\nunsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings\nwhich are primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on\noff–balance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                2024                2023         Average  2024                2023\nConsumer & Community           $  1,056,652        $  1,094,738          $  1,064,215        $  1,126,552\nBanking(a)\nCommercial & Investment           1,073,512           1,050,892             1,061,488             996,295\nBank(a)\nAsset & Wealth                      248,287             233,232               235,146             216,178\nManagement(a)\nCorporate                            27,581              21,826                25,793              20,042\nTotal Firm                     $  2,406,032        $  2,400,688          $  2,386,642        $  2,359,067\n(a) In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB transferred\ncertain deposits associated with First Republic to AWM\nand CIB.\nThe Firm believes that deposits provide a stable\nsource of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. A significant portion\nof the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are both\nconsidered to be stable sources of liquidity.\nWholesale operating deposits are generally considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends than\nperiod-end deposit balances. However, during periods\nof market disruption, average deposit trends may be\nimpacted.\nThe following discussion excludes the impact of the\ntransfer of certain First Republic deposits in the\nfourth quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs as\nthe transfers had no net impact on Firmwide deposits.\nAverage deposits increased for the year ended December\n31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023,\nreflecting:\nan increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly\nin Payments and net issuances of structured notes as a\nresult of client demand in Markets, partially offset\nby deposit attrition, which included actions taken to\nreduce certain deposits,\nthe timing impact of First Republic,\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, reflecting the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely\noffset by continued migration into other investments,\nand\na decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in\nbalances in existing accounts due to increased\ncustomer spending, largely offset by new accounts.\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31, 2023,\nreflecting:\nan increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly\nin Payments, largely offset by net maturities of\nstructured notes in Markets,\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, reflecting the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely\noffset by continued migration into other investments,\nand\na decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in\nbalances in existing accounts due to increased\ncustomer spending and migration into higher-yielding\ninvestments, predominantly offset by new accounts.\nRefer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAnalysis and the Business Segment & Corporate Results\non pages 63–65 and pages 70–90, respectively, for\nfurther information on deposit and liability balance\ntrends, as well as Executive Overview\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    111\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\non pages 54–58 and Note 34 for additional information\non the First Republic acquisition.

Deposit insurance protection may\nbe available to depositors in the countries in which\nthe deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC\nprovides deposit insurance protection for deposits\nplaced in a U.S. depository institution. At December\n31, 2024 and 2023 (a) , the Firmwide estimated\nuninsured deposits were $1,414.0 billion and $1,347.8\nbillion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale\noperating deposits.\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits.

Refer to the Executive Overview on pages 54–58 and Note 34 for\nadditional information.\nShort-term funding\nThe Firm’s primary source of short-term secured\nfunding is securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase. These instruments are secured\npredominantly by high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency MBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at December 31,\n2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by\nMarkets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making\nactivities and higher secured financing of trading\nassets.\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at\nDecember 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, as well as\nthe increase for the average year ended December 31,\n2024, compared to the prior year period, were both due\nto higher financing requirements in Markets, partially\noffset by FHLB maturities in Treasury and CIO.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients,\nthe Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing\nmanagement of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured financing (for\nboth the investment securities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured\nfunding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds.\nThe decrease in average commercial paper for the year\nended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod was due to lower issuances primarily as a\nresult of short-term liquidity management.\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at\nDecember 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was\npredominantly driven by net issuances of structured\nnotes in Markets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    113\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nLong-term funding\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,\nincluding TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and\noptimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal\nlong-term funding plan.\nUnsecured funding and issuance\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to\nprovide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company\nadvances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties. The increase in structured notes at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and for the average\nyear ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by net issuances of\nstructured notes in Markets due to client demand.\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.\nLong-term unsecured\nfunding\nYear ended December 31,                         2024             2023                     2024             2023\n(Notional in millions)          Parent Company                              Subsidiaries\nIssuance\nSenior notes issued in       $          37,000        $  14,256          $             —        $   3,750\nthe U.S. market\nSenior notes issued in                   4,079            2,141                        —                —\nnon-U.S. markets\nTotal senior notes                      41,079           16,397                        —            3,750\nStructured notes(a)                      3,944            3,013                   54,993           35,281\nTotal long-term unsecured\nfunding –                    $          45,023        $  19,410          $        54,993        $  39,031\nissuance\nMaturities/redemptions\nSenior notes                 $          25,765        $  21,483          $            65        $      67\nSubordinated debt                        3,097            2,090                      250                —\nStructured notes                           892            1,532                   47,425           28,777\nTotal long-term unsecured\nfunding –                    $          29,754        $  25,105          $        47,740        $  28,844\nmaturities/redemptions\n(a) Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.\nSecured funding and issuance\nThe Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB\nadvances.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the\nFirm\nbelieves are incorporated in its liquidity risk and\nstress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings.

These events could contribute to\nfinancial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement\nactions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well\nas other harm to the Firm.\nOrganization and management\nReputation Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that establishes the governance\nframework for managing reputation risk across the\nFirm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is\ninherently challenging to identify, manage, and\nquantify.\nThe Firm’s reputation risk management function\nincludes the following activities:\nMaintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance\npolicy and a standard consistent with the reputation\nrisk framework\nProviding oversight of the governance framework\nthrough processes and infrastructure to support\nconsistent identification, escalation and monitoring\nof reputation risk issues Firmwide\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the\nprinciples for managing reputation risk for the Firm.\nIt is the responsibility of each LOB and Corporate,\nand the Firm’s employees, to consider the reputation\nof the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new\nproduct, engage in a transaction or client\nrelationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a\nbusiness process or consider any other activity.\nEnvironmental impacts and social concerns are\nimportant considerations in assessing the Firm’s\nreputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s\nreputation risk governance.\n116    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with\nthe default or change in credit profile of a client,\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a\nreduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk,\nand investment portfolio risk.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of\nclients and customers, ranging from large corporate\nand institutional clients to individual consumers and\nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm\nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home\nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with\nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through\nits operating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors and measures credit\nrisk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk\npolicies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit\nrisk management governance includes the following\nactivities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring and measuring credit risk across all\nportfolio segments, including transaction and exposure\napproval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for\ncredit review and analysis\nAssigning and maintaining credit approval\nauthorities in connection with the approval of credit\nexposure\nMonitoring and independent assessment of criticized\nexposures and delinquent loans, and\nEstimating credit losses and supporting appropriate\ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor\nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring\ncredit risk vary depending on several factors,\nincluding type of asset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g.,\ndelinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk management and\ncollection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of\nan obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm\nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses\nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and\nthe allowance for investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and\nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on\npages 161–164 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital\nand represent the potential volatility of actual\nlosses relative to the established allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The analyses\nfor these losses include stress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined\ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic\nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress\ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional\nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry\nand country- specific stress scenarios, as\nappropriate. The Firm uses stress testing to inform\ndecisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and\nLOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress\non individual counterparties.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    117\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of\nthe approval and decision-making process for extending\ncredit so that credit risks are assessed accurately,\napproved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval\nauthorities, concentration limits, risk-rating\nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In\naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used\nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and\nother trends, including any concentrations at the\nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be\naddressed through changes in underwriting policies and\nportfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends against\nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and trends are\nincorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer\ncredit losses and are part of the monitoring of the\ncredit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client\nand counterparty level with established concentration\nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as\ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure\nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval processes\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent\nCredit Review function is responsible for:\nI ndependently assessing risk grades assigned to\nexposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio and\nthe timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by\nresponsible business units; and\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper\nmonitoring and management of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading policies and\nunderwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio\nreporting of industry, clients, counterparties and\ncustomers, product and geography are prepared, and the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly\nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance\nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are\nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk\ncommittees, senior management and the Board of\nDirectors.\n118    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

The following discussions provide\ninformation concerning individual loan products. Refer\nto Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about delinquencies,\nloan modifications and other credit quality\nindicators. Residential real estate: The residential\nreal estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale\nand loans at fair value, predominantly consists of\nprime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.\nRetained loans decreased compared to December 31,\n2023, predominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales,\nnet of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2023, predominantly\ndriven by loan sales. Net recoveries were higher for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior\nyear, driven by loan sales. Loans held-for-sale and\nnonaccrual loans held-for-sale increased from December\n31, 2023, predominantly driven by transfers of certain\nretained loans in anticipation of securitization and\nloan sales, respectively. Loans at fair value\nincreased from December 31, 2023, predominantly driven\nby higher Home Lending loans, as originations outpaced\nwarehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans at fair value\nincreased compared to December 31, 2023, driven by\nCIB. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying\nvalues of retained interest-only residential mortgage\nloans were $88.9 billion and $90.6 billion,\nrespectively. These loans have an interest-only\npayment period generally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to\nmaturity and are typically originated as higher-\nbalance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit\nperformance of this portfolio is comparable to the\nperformance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.\nThe carrying value of retained home equity lines of\ncredit outstanding was $14.5 billion at December 31,\n2024, including $3.8 billion of HELOCs that have\nrecast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments\nor have been modified, and $3.6 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after\n2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their\nrevolving period by reducing or canceling the undrawn\nline in accordance with the contract or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there has\nbeen a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of\nthe borrower or significant decrease in the value of\nthe underlying property.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm\nmonitors its exposure to certain potential\nunrecoverable claim payments related to government-\ninsured loans and considers this exposure in\nestimating the allowance for loan losses.\n(in millions)                                December 31, 2024          December 31, 2023\nCurrent                              $  462                     $  446\n30-89 days past due                      72                        102\n90 or more days past due                121                        182\nTotal government guaranteed loans    $  655                     $  730\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-to-\nvalue ratio of residential real estate loans At\nDecember 31, 2024, $217.7 billion, or 70% of the total\nretained residential real estate loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas\nand Massachusetts, compared to $228.4 billion, or 70%\nat December 31, 2023.

The\nportfolio decreased when compared to December 31,\n2023, predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net\ncharge-offs increased compared to the prior year,\npredominantly due to net charge-offs of scored auto\nloans of $445 million compared to $357 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in\nused vehicle valuations.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client\nconcentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 128–131 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which\nthe wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2024, loans\nincreased $19.8 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB and higher securities-based lending in AWM.

Total criticized exposure,\nexcluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7\nbillion, $39.9 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate resulting from\ndowngrades, primarily in Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in Technology and Media, partially offset by\nConsumer & Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The contractual amounts of these\nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible\ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these\ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations\nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently\nfail to perform according to the terms of these\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced, extended,\ncancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the Firm does not\nbelieve that the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm’s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for\nfurther information on wholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment\nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the\nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on\ndeposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors\nthe required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to\ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally\nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of\nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and\nthe Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s\nobligation to provide, additional margin when the fair\nvalue of the collateral declines. Because of these\nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not\nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses\nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\nbased on the value of the collateral and probability\nof borrower default. These receivables are reported\nwithin accrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s\naccounting policies for the allowance for credit\nlosses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange\nand equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs\nand uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, the\nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),\nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also\nbe exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP.\nWhere possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit\nrisk exposures arising from derivative contracts\nthrough the use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage\nof the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to\ncollateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity and\ncentrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was\napproximately 86% and 87% at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements\nand for a further discussion of derivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets was $61.0 billion and\n$54.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The increase was primarily as a result\nof market movements. Derivative receivables represent\nthe fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by the\nFirm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the\nFirm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition of\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits\nof these additional collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are subject to a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement and limited to the net amount\nof the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily\ncash, G7 government securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed securities, and\ncorporate debt and equity securities) delivered by\nclients at the initiation of transactions, as well as\ncollateral related to contracts that have a non-daily\ncall frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of the reporting\ndate. Although this collateral does not reduce the\nreceivables balances and is not included in the tables\nbelow, it is available as security against potential\nexposure that could arise should the fair value of the\nclient’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s\nfavor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on\nthe Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative\ntransactions.\n134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods\npresented.\nDerivative receivables\nDecember 31, (in millions)                              2024              2023\nTotal, net of cash collateral               $   60,967        $   54,864\nLiquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative             -28,160           -22,461\nreceivables\nTotal, net of liquid securities and         $   32,807        $   32,403\nother cash collateral\nOther collateral held against derivative        -1,021              -993\nreceivables\nTotal, net of collateral                    $   31,786        $   31,410\nRatings profile\nof derivative\nreceivables\nDecember 31,                        2024                                            2023       % of exposure\n(in millions,            Exposure net of    % of exposure net            Exposure net of                 net\nexcept ratios)                collateral        of collateral                 collateral       of collateral\nInvestment-grade    $             23,783                   75  %    $             24,004                  76  %\nNoninvestment-g…                   8,003                   25                      7,406                  24\nTotal               $             31,786                  100  %    $             31,410                 100  %\nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure, the\nnet fair value of the derivative receivables does not\ncapture the potential future variability of that\ncredit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm\ncalculates, on a client-by-client basis, three\nmeasures of potential derivatives-related credit loss:\nPeak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average\nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level\nover the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value\nof the Firm’s derivative exposures, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG\nover the total life of the derivative contract is used\nas the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used\nto calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further\ndescribed below.\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in\nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the\ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In\naddition, the Firm’s risk management process for\nderivatives exposures takes into consideration the\npotential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly\ndefined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact of a default by\nthe same counterparty, which could cause exposure to\nincrease at the same time as the counterparty’s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many\nfactors may influence the nature and magnitude of\nthese correlations over time. To the extent that these\ncorrelations are identified, the Firm may adjust the\nCVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG.\nThe Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by\nentering into credit derivative contracts, as well as\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity\nderivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s\ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years\nas calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The\nthree measures generally show that exposure will\ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    135\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-\nmaker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit\nportfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate\nthe credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management\nactivities”). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also\nuses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain\nsecurities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit\nportfolio management activities.\nCredit derivatives and credit-related\nnotes used in credit portfolio management\nactivities\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nCredit derivatives and credit-related            Notional amount of protection purchased\nnotes used to manage:                                                        and sold(a)  2024             2023\nLoans and lending-related commitments         $                                   25,216        $  24,157\nDerivative receivables                                                            15,672           12,832\nCredit derivatives and credit-related\nnotes used in credit portfolio                $                                   40,888        $  36,989\nmanagement activities\n(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s\nnet protection purchased or sold with respect to each\nunderlying reference entity or index. The credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting under\nU.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair\nvalue, with gains and losses recognized in principal\ntransactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and\nlending-related commitments being risk-managed are\naccounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in\naccounting treatment, between loans and lending-\nrelated commitments and the credit derivatives used in\ncredit portfolio management activities, causes\nearnings volatility that is not representative, in the\nFirm’s view, of the true changes in value of the\nFirm’s overall credit exposure. The effectiveness of\ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the\nFirm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of\nfactors, including the named reference entity (i.e.,\nthe Firm may experience losses on specific exposures\nthat are different than the named reference entities\nin the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the\nCDS (which may have a defined credit event that does\nnot align with an actual loss realized by the Firm);\nand the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which\nin some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s\nexposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to\npurchase credit protection with a maturity date that\nis the same or similar to the maturity date of the\nexposure for which the protection was purchased, and\nremaining differences in maturity are actively\nmonitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit\nderivatives in Note 5 for further information on\ncredit derivatives and derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities.\n136    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm's financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's\nallowance for credit losses generally consists of:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is reflected in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024\nwas $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1\nbillion from December 31, 2023. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses included: • $2.1\nbillion in consumer , reflecting: – a $2.2 billion net\naddition in Card Services, predominantly driven by\nloan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances,\nincluding the seasoning of vintages originated in\nrecent years, partially offset by – a $125 million net\nreduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of\n2024, and • a net reduction of $30 million in\nwholesale , reflecting: – changes in certain\nmacroeconomic variables, an update to loss assumptions\non certain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to\ncharge-offs largely from collateral-dependent loans,\npredominantly offset by – net downgrade activity,\nprimarily in Real Estate, and the impact of\nincorporating the First Republic portfolio into the\nFirm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second\nquarter of 2024. The Firm’s qualitative adjustments\ncontinued to include additional weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and\ndownside risks related to the geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for\ncredit losses is estimated using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed macroeconomic scenarios.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December 31,\n2024, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was\n$678.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–90\nand Note 10 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer\nto Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for\nfurther information on related liquidity risk. Refer\nto Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent in the\nportfolio. Governance and oversight Investment\nsecurities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk\nAppetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk\nCommittee with regular updates provided to the Board\nRisk Committee. The Firm’s independent control\nfunctions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including capital\nand credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The Firm’s investments will continue to\nevolve based on market circumstances and in line with\nits strategic initiatives.

Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14\nand 25 for additional information. Governance and\noversight The Firm’s approach to managing principal\ninvestment risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk\ngovernance structure. The Firm has established a\nFirmwide risk policy framework for all principal\ninvesting activities that includes approval by\nexecutives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate. The Firm’s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investments\nin accordance with relevant policies. As part of the\nrisk governance structure, approved levels for\ninvestments are established and monitored for each\nrelevant business or segment in order to manage the\noverall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts\nstress testing on these portfolios using specific\nscenarios that estimate losses based on significant\nmarket moves and/or other risk events.\n140    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of\nassets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies\nand procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to facilitate efficient\nrisk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating\nperformance and provide transparency into the Firm’s\nmarket risk profile for senior management, the Board\nof Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is\nresponsible for the following functions:\nMaintaining a market risk policy framework\nIndependently measuring and monitoring LOB,\nCorporate, and Firmwide market risk\nDefining, approving and monitoring limits\nPerforming stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and\ntherefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics,\nboth statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk\nincluding:\nValue-at-risk\nStress testing\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nEarnings-at-risk\nEconomic Value Sensitivity\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting limits,\nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration\nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity,\naccommodation of client business, and management\njudgment. Market Risk Management maintains different\nlevels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and\nstress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented\nby certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit\nand loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis.\nLimits that have not been reviewed within specified\ntime periods by Market Risk Management are reported to\nsenior management. The LOBs and Corporate are\nresponsible for adhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely\nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In the event of a\nbreach, Market Risk Management consults with senior\nmembers of appropriate groups within the Firm to\ndetermine the suitable course of action required to\nreturn the applicable positions to compliance, which\nmay include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the\nbreach or granting a temporary increase in limits to\naccommodate an expected increase in client activity\nand/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level\nlimit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous\n12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are representative\nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the\nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that\nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made\nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification\nacross product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results\nare reported as appropriate to various groups\nincluding senior management, the Board Risk Committee\nand regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market\nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product\ntypes. To capture material market risks as part of the\nFirm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses\nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR\nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk\nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as\nsensitivities and historical time series used to\ngenerate daily market values may be different across\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR\nmodel results across all portfolios are aggregated at\nthe Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time horizons, and\nother factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict\nlosses, particularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm\nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It\nis likely that using an actual price-based time series\nfor these products, if available, would affect the VaR\nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in\naddition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk\npositions.\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market data\nused may be different than the independent third-party\ndata collected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data sources may\ndiffer. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for\nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 160 for information regarding model\nreviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR\nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory\nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital\nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently\nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an\nexpected tail-loss methodology which approximates a\n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to\n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital\nrules, which may be different than the positions\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the\ndiversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory\nCapital Disclosures reports, which are available on\nthe Firm’s website, for additional information on\nRegulatory VaR and the other components of market risk\nregulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based\nmeasure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective\nbacktesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    143\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and\nrisk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR\nfor each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans\nand lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include\nthe retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model\ngovernance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio\nVaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were\nalso removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM\nVaR due to the increase associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-\nrelated commitments. The VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.\n(e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares which the Firm\ndisposed of in the second and third quarters of 2024. The impact of Visa C shares resulted in elevated average and\nmaximum Corporate VaR, Other VaR and Total VaR. Refer to Executive Overview on pages 54–58 for additional\ninformation.\n2024 compared with 2023\nAverage Total VaR increased by $4 million for the year\nended December 31, 2024 when compared with the prior\nyear. The increase was predominantly driven by the\nimpact of the Firm’s receipt of Visa C shares on\nCorporate VaR and increases associated with credit\nprotection purchased against certain retained loans\nand lending-related commitments within Credit\nPortfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset by market\nvolatility rolling out of the one-year historical\nlook-back period impacting the Fixed income risk type.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the four trailing quarters. The increase in VaR\nand subsequent decline observed in the second quarter\nof 2024 was primarily driven by changes in Visa C\nshare exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nFirst Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter\n2024             2024              2024             2024\n144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which\ncompares the daily Risk Management VaR results with\nthe daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR\nbacktesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in\nthe chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported\nrevenue as they exclude certain components of total\nnet revenue, such as those associated with the\nexecution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-\ndriven trading and intraday risk management\nactivities), fees, commissions, other valuation\nadjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset\nthe backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under\nBasel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily\nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management\nVaR methodology, assuming current changes in market\nvalues are consistent with the historical changes used\nin the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading\ndays on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically\nexpected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during\nthe 12 months of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Firm\nposted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260 days, and\nobserved eight VaR backtesting exceptions, of which\nthree were in the three months ended December 31,\n2024. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from\nthe loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and\nEquity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB\nMarkets revenue, as the population of positions which\ncomprise each metric are different and due to the\nexclusion of certain components of total net revenue\nin backtesting gains and losses as described above.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of\nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December 31,\n2024. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management\nVaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point\nintervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within\nthe intervals that are greater than one hundred\npercent.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but\npossible economic and market scenarios. The results\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for\nthose potential losses and are measured against\nlimits.\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of\npotential stress for both market rallies and market\nsell-offs, assuming significant changes in market\nfactors such as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array\nof hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on\ntail events in specific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact multiple market\nfactors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate\nspecific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk\nbetween different products. The flexibility in the\nstress framework allows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible\nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are\nreported periodically to senior management of the\nFirm, as appropriate.\nStress methodologies are governed by the overall\nstress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress\nMethodology Committee reviews and approves changes to\nstress testing methodology and scenarios across the\nFirm. Significant changes to the framework are\nescalated to senior management, as appropriate. In\naddition, stress methodology and the models to\ncalculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s\nEstimations and Model Risk Management Policy\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board\nof Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework,\nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance.\nA profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\nStructural interest rate risk management\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities which are included in VaR, but also from\nthe Firm’s traditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit facilities,\ntaking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the\ninvestment securities portfolio, and associated\nderivative instruments. Refer to the table on page 142\nfor a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying\npositions included in earnings-at-risk.\nGovernance\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest\nrate risk management policy and related limits, which\nare subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee.\nTreasury and CIO, working in partnership with the\nLOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate\nrisk profile and reviews it with senior management,\nincluding the CTC Risk Committee. In addition,\noversight of structural interest rate risk is managed\nthrough a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC\nCRO. This risk function is responsible for providing\nindependent oversight and governance around\nassumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for\nstructural interest rate risk, including limits\nrelated to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value\nSensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate\nrisk generally through its investment securities\nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\nKey risk drivers and risk management process\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments\nas interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide\nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate\nrisk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer\npricing, which takes into account the elements of\ninterest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in\nfinancial markets. These elements include asset and\nliability balances and contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment schedules, expected\nprepayment\n146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nexperience, interest rate reset dates and maturities,\nrate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate\nceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\nEarnings-at-Risk\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest\nrates and, in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes\nto this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets\nand liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained and held-for-\nsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and\nfinancing activities, investment securities, long-term\ndebt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer\npricing of other positions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as described on page\n142. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these\nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar\nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital\ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange\nrisk on page 149 for more informa tion.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a baseline over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a\nsteeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates\nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter\nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different factors, including:\nThe impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other factors\nwhich are updated periodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in\nthe Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening\nand usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that\nrequire management judgment. The amount of deposits\nthat the Firm holds at any given time may be\ninfluenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as\nbroader monetary conditions and competition for\ndeposits.\nThe pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit\nrates paid could change upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ\nfrom the modeled assumptions, primarily due to\ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits.\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and forecasts\nof deposit balances, both of which are especially\nsignificant in the case of consumer deposits. The\nresults of these sensitivity analyses are reported to\nthe CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s\nsimulation and other factors. In the second quarter of\n2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid\nassumptions which take into account observed pricing\nand client and customer behavior during the most\nrecent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates\npaid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios,\nresulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in\nhigher interest rate scenarios, and an increase in\nnegative sensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures\nof the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s\nactual net interest income for the rate changes\npresented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any\nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients\nor customers in response to rate changes. Other\nsignificant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk\nscenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit\nrates paid, may also differ from actual results. The\nFirm’s forecast for net interest income is included in\nthe Firm’s outlook on page 57.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    147\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe Firm’s sensitivities are presented in the table\nbelow.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\nParallel shift:                          2024(a)       2023(b)\n+100 bps shift in rates               $      2.3    $      3.1\n-100 bps shift in rates                     -2.5          -2.8\n+200 bps shift in rates                      4.6           6.2\n-200 bps shift in rates                     -4.9          -6.1\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates            1.0           0.6\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates          -1.4          -2.2\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates           1.2           2.5\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates           -1.1          -0.6\n(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and\nnon-U.S. dollar rates, and the inclusion of the hedges\nof non-U.S. dollar capital investments. This inclusion\nhad no impact on total sensitivities but increased\nU.S. dollar and decreased non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities. Subsequent to this change, non-U.S.\ndollar sensitivities were insignificant. (b) At\nDecember 31, 2023, represents the total of the Firm’s\nU.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities as\npreviously reported. The change in the Firm’s\nsensitivities as of December 31, 2024, compared to\nDecember 31, 2023, were primarily driven by Treasury\nand CIO balance sheet actions where the Firm added\nduration through investment securities activity, cash\nflow hedges of retained loans and fair value hedges of\nFirm debt. The impact on the sensitivities of the\nTreasury and CIO balance sheet actions were largely\noffset by the impact of deposits, primarily from the\nsecond quarter of 2024 update of the deposit rates\npaid assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale\ndeposit products. Additionally, the results as of\nDecember 31, 2024 reflected the update to include\nhedges of the Firm’s non-U.S. dollar capital\ninvestments. Although total results were not impacted,\nthese hedges increase U.S. dollar sensitivities and\ndecrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities.

EVS\nstress tests the longer-term economic value of equity\nby measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current\nbalance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits,\ndebt and investment securities as well as related\nhedges, under various interest rate scenarios. The\nFirm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated\nwith deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions for\nloans and securities, are significant factors in the\nEVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate\nrisk management policy, the Firm has established\nlimits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain\nassumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from\nthose required in the fair value measurement note to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. For example,\ncertain assets and liabilities with no stated\nmaturity, such as credit card receivables and\ndeposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS\nmeasure. Additional information on long-term debt and\nheld to maturity investment securities is disclosed on\npage 201 in Note 2.\n148    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNon-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\nNon-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or\nliabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital\ninvestments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of\nthe Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment &\nCorporate Results on page 71 for additional information.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to\nchanges in relevant market variables.

The Country Risk Management group actively\nmonitors the various portfolios which may be impacted\nby these developments and measures the extent to which\nthe Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s\nstrategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that assesses and monitors\nexposure to country risk across the Firm.\nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes\nthe following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards\nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks\nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and\nstress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting\ntrends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling\nmodels and ratings indicators, for early\nidentification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of\nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero\nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities\nwhich result in contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country exposure\nmeasure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not\nsuitable for attribution to an individual country. The\nuse of different measurement approaches or assumptions\ncould affect the amount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\nDeposits with banks are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central banks, commercial banks,\nand other financial institutions\nLending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their\nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral\nreceived\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair\nvalue of all positions, including both long and short\npositions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives exposure is measured at the net\nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for\nthe same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the\nfair value of the derivative receivable or payable,\nreflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these\nexposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims\nto estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements\nto a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management\nperiodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of\ncountries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and\ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as\nnecessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk\nManagement to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management\npurposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including dependent\nterritories and Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) such as Hong Kong SAR, separately from the independent\nsovereign states with which they are associated. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2024, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2023. The\ntop 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may\nfluct uate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity\nmanagement activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when compared to December 31,\n2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Germany, predominantly due to client-driven\nmarket-making activities and higher client deposits. The increase in exposure to Japan when compared to December\n31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of client-driven\nmarket-making activities.

Climate change is\nviewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing\ntypes of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is\ncategorized into physical risk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk involves economic costs and financial\nlosses due to a changing climate. Acute physical risk\ndrivers include the increased frequency or severity of\nclimate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires\nand tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers\ninclude more gradual shifts in the climate, such as\nsea level rise, persistent changes in precipitation\nlevels and increases in average ambient temperatures.\nTransition risk involves the financial and economic\nconsequences of society’s shift toward a lower-carbon\neconomy. Transition risk drivers include possible\nchanges in public policy, adoption of new technologies\nand shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks\nmay also be influenced by changes in the physical\nclimate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that\nis responsible for establishing and maintaining the\nFirmwide framework and strategy for managing climate\nrisks that may impact the Firm.\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\nSetting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across the\nFirm\nDeveloping metrics, scenarios and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of potential\nclimate-related financial and economic impacts to the\nFirm\nEstablishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy\nand the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of climate\nrisks present in their business activities and for the\nadherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules\nand regulations.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s framework and strategy for managing climate\nrisk is integrated into the Firm’s risk governance\nstructure. This framework allows for the escalation of\nsignificant climate risk-related issues to LOB Risk\nCommittees. The Board Risk Committee also receives\ninformation on significant climate risks and climate-\nrelated initiatives, as appropriate.\n152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nRisk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest\nitself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,\nbusiness disruptions (including those caused by\nextraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or\nfailure of vendors or other third party providers to\nperform in accordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of the\nFirm’s financial position, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and regulatory\nenvironments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk\n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable\nthe Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and\ntest, manage and report on the Firm’s operational\nrisk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management\nOrganization, which consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the\nday-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and\nFRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nis responsible for defining the CCOR Management\nFramework and establishing the minimum standards for\nits execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead\nOfficers report to the Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are\nindependent of the respective businesses or functions\nthey oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is\nincluded in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy\nthat is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their\nrespective control environment to assess circumstances\nin which controls have failed, and to determine where\nremediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s\nOperational Risk and Compliance organization\n(“Operational Risk and Compliance”)\nprovides oversight of and challenge to these\nevaluations and may also perform independent\nassessments of significant operational risk events and\nareas of concentrated or emerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the control\nenvironments and reporting the results to senior\nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses\noperational risks through quantitative means,\nincluding operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach\n(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the\nprojected frequency and severity of operational risk\nlosses based on historical data. The LDA model is used\nto estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a\none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level.\nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal operational\nrisk losses in the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after\nthe issues or business activities giving rise to the\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the\nFirm’s operational risk capital methodology, which\nuses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),\nincorporates internal and external losses as well as\nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of\nkey business environment and internal control metrics.\nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in\nits AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The\nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR\nand other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 for\ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and Testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in connection\nwith their independent monitoring and testing\ncompliance of the LOBs and Corporate with\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    153\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nlaws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance independently\nidentify areas of heightened operational risk and\ntests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs\nand Corporate.\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation of\naction plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational\nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate\nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed.\nOperational Risk and Compliance has established\nstandards designed to ensure that consistent\noperational risk reporting and operational risk\nreports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by\nthe LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the\nevaluation of key risk and performance indicators\nagainst established thresholds as well as the\nassessment of different types of operational risk\nagainst stated risk appetite. The standards establish\nescalation protocols to senior management and to the\nBoard of Directors.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm.\nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers\nand maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park\nAssurance Company. Insurance may also be required by\nthird parties with whom the Firm does business.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.\nOperational risk subcategories include Compliance\nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and\nModel risk. Refer to pages 157, 158, 159 and 160,\nrespectively for more information on Compliance,\nConduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of operational risks\nsuch as business and technology resiliency, payment\nfraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as\ncybersecurity, are provided below.\nFirmwide resiliency risk\nDisruptions of the Firm’s business and operations can\noccur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as\nthe spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe\nweather, natural disasters, the effects of climate\nchange, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a\nthird party to provide expected services,\ncyberattacks, civil or political unrest or terrorism.\nThe Firm’s resiliency framework is intended to enable\nthe Firm to prepare for and adapt to changing\nconditions and withstand and recover from, and address\nadverse effects on its operations caused by,\ndisruptions that may impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets, including its staff,\ntechnology, data and facilities, as well as those of\nthird-party service providers. The framework includes\ngovernance, awareness training, planning and testing\nof recovery strategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage\nresiliency risks. The framework operates in accordance\nwith the Firm’s overall approach to Operational Risk\nManagement, including alignment with technology,\ncybersecurity, data, physical security, crisis\nmanagement, real estate and outsourcing programs.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The Firm employs various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well as providing\nemployee and client education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers and other third parties to an\nappropriate standard of operational performance and to\nmitigate key risks, including data loss and business\ndisruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group\nis responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring,\nreporting and standards with respect to third-party\noutsourcing risks.\n154    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the\nunauthorized disclosure of data.\nOverview\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously\nevolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are\ndevoted to protecting and enhancing the security of\ncomputer systems, software, networks, storage devices,\nand other technology. The Firm’s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks that can result in unauthorized\naccess to confidential information, the destruction of\ndata, disruptions to or degradations of service, the\nsabotaging of systems or other damage. The Firm has\nexperienced, and expects that it will continue to\nexperience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber\nattacks against the backdrop of heightened\ngeopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented\nmeasures and controls reasonably designed to address\nthis evolving environment, including enhanced threat\nmonitoring. In addition, the Firm continues to review\nand enhance its capabilities to address associated\nrisks, such as those relating to the management of\nadministrative access to systems. Third parties with\nwhich the Firm does business, that facilitate the\nFirm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply\nchain, exchanges, clearing houses, central\ndepositories, and financial intermediaries) or that\nthe Firm has acquired are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party incidents\nsuch as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by\nthe employees of such parties, or cyber attacks,\nincluding ransomware and supply-chain compromises,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Firm,\nincluding in circumstances in which an affected third\nparty is unable to deliver a product or service to the\nFirm or where the incident delivers compromised\nsoftware to the Firm or results in lost or compromised\ninformation of the Firm or its clients or customers.\nClients and customers are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information\nassets, particularly when their activities and systems\nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control\nsystems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions with\nits clients, customers and other external parties\nconcerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities\nto improve cybersecurity. Risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, including any previous cybersecurity events,\nhave not materially affected the Firm or its business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial\ncondition.Notwithstanding the comprehensive approach\nthat the Firm takes to address cybersecurity risk, the\nFirm may not be successful in preventing or mitigating\na future\ncybersecurity incident that could have a material\nadverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nOrganization and management\nThe Global Chief Information Security Officer\n(“CISO”)reports to the Global Chief Information\nOfficer, and is a member of key cybersecurity\ngovernance forums. The CISO leads the Global\nCybersecurity and Technology Controls organization,\nwhich is responsible for identifying technology and\ncybersecurity risks and for implementing and\nmaintaining controls to manage cybersecurity threats.\nThe CISO and the members of senior management within\nGlobal Technology and the Cybersecurity and Technology\nControls organizations all have relevant expertise and\nexperience in cybersecurity and information technology\nrisk management, including relevant experience at the\nFirm, at other financial services companies or in\nother highly-regulated industries.\nThe CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information\nSecurity Program, which is designed to prevent, detect\nand respond to cyber attacks in order to help\nsafeguard the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the Firm's infrastructure, resources\nand information. The program includes managing the\nFirm’s global cybersecurity operations centers,\nproviding training, conducting cybersecurity event\nsimulation exercises, implementing the Firm’s policies\nand standards relating to technology risk and\ncybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed,\nthe Firm’s cybersecurity capabilities.\nThe Firm’s Information Security Program includes the\nfollowing functions:\nCyber Operations , which is responsible for\nimplementing and maintaining controls designed to\ndetect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and\nincludes a dedicated function for incident response\nand ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and\nvulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s\nthird-party suppliers.\nTechnology Governance, Risk & Controls , which is\nresponsible for operationalizing technology risk and\ncontrol frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments\nthat may impact the Firm, and developing control\ncatalogs and assessments of controls, as well as\noverseeing governance and reporting of technology and\ncybersecurity risk.\nSecurity Awareness , which provides awareness and\ntraining that reinforces information risk and security\nmanagement practices and compliance with the Firm's\npolicies, standards and practices. The training is\nmandatory for all employees globally on a periodic\nbasis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing\ninitiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The\nFirm also provides specialized security training to\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    155\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nemployees in specific roles, such as application\ndevelopers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires\nall employees to take periodic training on data\nprivacy that focuses on confidentiality and security,\nas well as responding to unauthorized access to or use\nof information.\nTechnology Resiliency , which establishes control\nrequirements for planning and testing the prioritized\nrecovery of technology services in the event of\ndegradation or outage, including incident response\nplanning, data backup and retention, and recovery\nreadiness in support of the Firmwide Business\nResiliency Program and operational risk management\npractices.\nThe Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan\ndesigned to enable the Firm to respond to attempted\ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate\nwith law enforcement and other government agencies,\nnotify clients and customers, as applicable, and\nrecover from such incidents. In addition, the Firm\nactively partners with appropriate government and law\nenforcement agencies and peer industry forums,\nparticipating in discussions and simulations to assist\nin understanding the full spectrum of cybersecurity\nrisks and in enhancing defenses and improving\nresiliency in the Firm’s operating environment.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity\nand Technology Controls organization is designed to\nappropriately identify, escalate and mitigate\ncybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk management and\nits governance and oversight are integrated into the\nFirm’s operational risk management framework,\nincluding through the escalation of key risk and\ncontrol issues to management and the development of\nrisk mitigation plans for heightened risk and control\nissues.IRM independently assesses and challenges the\nactivities and risk management practices of the Global\nCybersecurity and Technology Controls organization\nrelated to the identification, assessment, measurement\nand mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As needed, the\nFirm engages third-party assessors or auditing firms\nwith industry-recognized expertise on cybersecurity\nmatters to review specific aspects of the Firm’s\ncybersecurity risk management framework, processes and\ncontrols.\nThe governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement includes governance forums that inform\nmanagement of key areas of concern regarding the\nprevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of\ncybersecurity risks.\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating\nCommittee (“CTOC”) is the principal management\ncommittee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and\nmanagement of cybersecurity risk, including oversight\nof the implementation and maintenance of appropriate\ncontrols in support of the Firm’s Information Security\nProgram.The membership of the CTOC includes senior\nrepresentatives from the Global Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Controls organization and relevant\ncorporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit.\nThe CTOC escalates key operational risk and control\nissues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology\nOperating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control\ncommittee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate\nControl Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the\ngovernance of the Firmwide Global Technology\norganization, including oversight of Firmwide\ntechnology strategies, the delivery of technology and\ntechnology operations, the effective use of\ninformation technology resources, and monitoring and\nresolving key operational risk and control matters\narising in the Global Technology organization. As part\nof its oversight of management’s implementation and\nmaintenance of the Firm’s risk management framework,\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors receives periodic\nupdates from the CIO, the CISO and senior members of\nthe CTOC concerning cybersecurity matters.These\nupdates generally include information regarding\ncybersecurity and technology developments, the Firm’s\nInformation Security Program and recommended changes\nto that program, cybersecurity policies and practices,\nand ongoing initiatives to improve information\nsecurity, as well as any significant cybersecurity\nincidents and the Firm's efforts to address those\nincidents.The Audit Committee and the Risk Committee\nassist the Board in this oversight.\n156    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-\nregulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership\nof and accountability for managing their compliance\nrisk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\nOrganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”),\nwhich is independent of the LOBs and Corporate,\nprovides independent review, monitoring and oversight\nof business operations with a focus on compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the\ndelivery of the Firm’s products and services to\nclients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations across the LOBs and\nCorporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks\nrelated to financial products and services,\nrelationships and interactions with clients and\ncustomers, and employee activities. For example,\ncompliance risks include those associated with anti-\nmoney laundering compliance, trading activities,\nmarket conduct, and complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations related to the offering of products\nand services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance\nrisk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary\nactivities, including the failure to exercise the\napplicable standard of care to act in the best\ninterest of fiduciary clients and customers or to\ntreat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance\nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s\nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\ncompliance risk through the CCOR Management Framework.\nThe Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular\nupdates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit\nCommittee on significant compliance risk issues, as\nappropriate.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets\nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will\nconduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The\nCode provides the principles that help govern employee\nconduct with clients, customers, suppliers, vendors,\nshareholders, regulators, other employees, as well as\nwith the markets and communities in which the Firm\noperates. The Code requires employees to promptly\nreport any potential or actual violation of the Code,\nFirm policies, or laws, rules or regulations\napplicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires\nemployees to report any illegal or unethical conduct,\nor conduct that violates the underlying principles of\nthe Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants,\nclients, customers, suppliers, contract or temporary\nworkers, or business partners or agents.

A dedicated\nindependent function, Model Risk Governance and Review\n(“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies\nrelating to the management of model risk and risks\nassociated with certain analytical and judgment-based\nestimations, such as those used in risk management,\nbudget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific\npurposes of such models. Users and developers of\nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing\nand testing their models, as well as referring models\nto MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been\napproved, model users and developers are responsible\nfor maintaining a robust operating environment, and\nmust monitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers\nmay seek to enhance models in response to changes in\nthe relevant portfolios and in product and market\ndevelopments, as well as to capture improvements in\navailable modeling techniques and systems\ncapabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated\nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In\nits review of a model, MRGR considers whether the\nmodel is suitable for the specific purposes for which\nit will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes\nand challenges the model methodology and the\nreasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform\nor require additional testing, including back-testing\nof model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the\nappropriate level of management within MRGR based on\nthe relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well\nas material changes to existing models, prior to their\nuse. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be\ngranted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be\nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to\nmitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the\ninterim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of\nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly\ntrue when the current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed.\nThis increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater\ndegree of judgment and analytics to inform any\nadjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs\nthan would otherwise be the case. In addition, the\nFirm may experience increased uncertainty in its\nestimates if assets acquired differ from those used to\ndevelop the models.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 161–164 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\n160    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its reported\nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm’s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance\nfor credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than\ntwenty variables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses vary by\nportfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional\nU.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.\ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.\nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the\nloans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed\nas of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating\nmethodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the\nongoing integration of products and systems, the\nallowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale\nportfolio was initially measured based on similar risk\ncharacteristics from other facilities underwritten by\nthe Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the\nacquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in\nthe wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to\nNote 34 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 137 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    161\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nunemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 3.0% in the fourth quarter\nof 2025. This analysis is not intended to estimate\nexpected future changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses, for a number of reasons, including: • The\nallowance as of December 31, 2024, reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the central\nscenario due to the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios. • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are\nboth interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of\nthis analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables.\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate\nthe sensitivity of credit loss estimates to\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2024, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative\nadverse scenario to its central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: • An increase of approximately\n$850 million for residential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $3.7 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $4.1 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the\nFirm believes that its process to consider the\navailable information and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable\nand appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2024\n.\nFair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nincluding certain mortgage, home equity and other\nloans, where the carrying value is based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n162    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair\nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand\nhierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in\nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with\neach business combination is allocated to the related\nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated market\ncost of equity, as well as actual business results and\nprojections of business performance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired as of December 31, 2024. For each of the\nreporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by\nat least 10% and there was no indication of a\nsignificant risk of goodwill impairment based on\ncurrent projections and valuations.\nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are\nconsistent with management’s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best\nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in\nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of December 31, 2024.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorganChase offers credit cards with various rewards\nprograms which allow cardholders to earn rewards\npoints based on their account activity and the terms\nand conditions of the rewards program. Generally,\nthere are no limits on the points that an eligible\ncardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the\npoints can be redeemed for a variety of rewards,\nincluding cash (predominantly in the form of account\ncredits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a\nrewards liability which represents the estimated cost\nof rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed\nby cardholders. The liability is accrued as the\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the\ncardholder redeems points. This liability was $14.4\nbillion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and is recorded in accounts\npayable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The increase in the liability was\ndriven by continued growth in rewards points earned on\nhigher spend and promotional offers outpacing\nredemptions throughout 2024.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate\n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    163\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions. These\nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and\nmanagement judgment. Updates to these assumptions will\nimpact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2024,\na combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the rewards\nliability by approximately $442 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws of the\nvarious jurisdictions in which it operates, including\nU.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be\nsubject to different interpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of accounting for income\ntaxes, including the provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make\nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret and\napply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions\nand business events, as well as make judgments\nregarding the timing of when certain items may affect\ntaxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\njurisdictions.\nJPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws around the\nworld are subject to review and examination by the\nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where\nthe Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding\nits view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities\nmay be settled by audit, administrative appeals or\nadjudication in the court systems of the tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm operates.\nJPMorganChase regularly reviews whether it may be\nassessed additional income taxes as a result of the\nresolution of these matters, and the Firm records\nadditional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.\nIn addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of\nincome taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results\nof operations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets\nand liabilities measured for financial reporting\nversus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets\nare recognized if, in management’s judgment, their\nrealizability is determined to be more likely than\nnot. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years\nin which those temporary differences are expected to\nbe recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes\nof a change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax\ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs\nregular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews include\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions regarding\nfuture taxable income, including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be available\nto utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In\nconnection with these reviews, if it is determined\nthat a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. The valuation\nallowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting\nperiod if the Firm determines that, based on revised\nestimates of future taxable income or changes in tax\nplanning strategies, it is more likely than not that\nall or part of the deferred tax asset will become\nrealizable. As of December 31, 2024, management has\ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm\nwill realize its deferred tax assets, net of the\nexisting valuation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the\nreassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective\nincome tax rate in the period in which the\nreassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that\nits estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount\ncould be different from the amounts reflected in the\nFirm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the\nextent that the final outcome of these amounts is\ndifferent than the amounts recorded, such differences\nwill generally impact the Firm’s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination is\nmade.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of\ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred\ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and\nassumptions that could differ from the actual results\nreflected in income tax returns filed during the\nsubsequent year.

(“JPMorganChase” or\nthe “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed by, or under the supervision of,\nthe Firm’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and\neffected by JPMorganChase’s Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorganChase’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of\nJPMorganChase’s management and directors; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making\nthe assessment, management used the “Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2024,\nJPMorganChase’s internal control over financial\nreporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013\nframework. Additionally, based upon management’s\nassessment, the Firm determined that there were no\nmaterial weaknesses in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their\nreport which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 14, 2025\n168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2024, including the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”).

Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP• 300 Madison Avenue\nNew York, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    169\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component\nof Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total\nportfolio-based retained loans of $919.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024 . The Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the\nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the\nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied\nare determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take\ninto consideration the Firm's economic outlook as\nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S. unemployment and\nU.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of\nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as\nthe Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining\nthe quantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate, which in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nobtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the\nappropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss\nestimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use\nof professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls\nover model validation and generation of macroeconomic\nscenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i)\nevaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables.\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion\nof its assets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at\nfair value on a recurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $10.9 billion of trading assets and $51.8\nbillion of liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, collectively financial instruments,\nwhich are classified as level 3 as they contain one or\nmore inputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation models and\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the\nlevel 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs\nused by management to estimate the fair value of\ncertain of these financial instruments include\ninterest rate volatility, equity volatility, Bermudan\nswitch value and correlation relating to interest\nrates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange,\n170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\nequity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and equity-\nto-interest rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the inputs to\nestimate fair value, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\nin performing procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence obtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s determination of the fair value, including\ncontrols over models, inputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included, among others, the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an independent\nestimate of fair value for a sample of these financial\ninstruments and comparing management’s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair value.\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement, developing independent inputs and, as\nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s\naforementioned unobservable inputs.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary

consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 – Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further discussion of the Firm's reportable\nbusiness segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory authorities. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorganChase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the\nFirm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines\nwhether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that\nhave sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it\nhas a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the\nFirm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity\ninterests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but\ndoes not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method\nof accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included\nin other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds\nare structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the\ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm\nas the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote,\nor the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm\ndoes not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners\nor members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and\nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially\nsignificant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-\nheld and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These\ninvestments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage\nof equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded\nin other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the\naccounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that,\nby design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to\nmake significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation\nto absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most\ncommon type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company\nselling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal\ndocuments that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s\ninvestors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate\ninvestors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of\nthe assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is\nrequired to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    177\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To\nassess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s\neconomic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the\nVIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power\nover those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as\nasset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s\nassets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the\nactivities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to\nreceive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its\neconomic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements\ndeemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining\nwhether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in\nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of\ninterests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital\nstructure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1)\nwhether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on\ncertain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts\nand circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm\nrecognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis,\nbased on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information. Revenue from contracts with\ncustomers JPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment\nbanking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card\nincome, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of\nthe Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorganChase carries a portion of\nits assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions\nrevenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further\ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency\ntranslation JPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into\nU.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency\nfinancial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains\nand losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional\ncurrency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and\nliabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance\nsheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and\npurchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be\npresented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including\nderivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned\n178    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nagreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions\ngoverned by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single\ncurrency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or\ndeliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting\nparty (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the\nmoney” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only\nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of\ndefault rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are\nterminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all\nsuch sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to\npay the netted termination amount. Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often\ncontain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or\ncash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The\ncollateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a\nvalue equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master\nnetting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default\nby the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or\nthe cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate\ncollateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5 for further\ndiscussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities\nfinancing agreements. Statements of cash flows For JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is\ndefined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented\ninvestments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by program\nbasis, to be accounted for using the proportional amortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible\ninvestments, within an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the\nresulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and\nother tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially all of the return\nis from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under the\nmodified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to the classification and timing\nof the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments. As a result\nof the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously recognized in other income is now\nrecognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $\n161million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense and the effective tax rate by approximately $ 450million and\ntwopercentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net income. The\nguidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax\nbenefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the proportional\namortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant\nmodifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's\nrelationship with the underlying project. Refer to Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information. Accounting\nstandards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method The adoption\nof this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationship. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designated those\nsecurities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained\nearnings was not material.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    179\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (“TDRs”) The adoption of this guidance\neliminated the requirement to measure the allowance\nfor TDRs using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”)\nmethodology and allowed the option of a non-DCF\nportfolio-based approach for modified loans to\ntroubled borrowers. The Firm elected this option for\nall portfolios of modified loans to troubled borrowers\nexcept collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-\nrated loans, for which the Firm elected to continue\napplying a DCF methodology. The adoption of this\nguidance under the modified retrospective method on\nJanuary 1, 2023, resulted in a $ 446million increase\nto retained earnings.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorganChase’s other\nsignificant accounting policies and the Note and page\nwhere a detailed description of each policy can be\nfound.\nFair value measurement                      Note 2     page 181\nFair value option                           Note 3     page 203\nDerivative instruments                      Note 5     page 209\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest         Note 6     page 225\nexpense\nInterest income and Interest expense        Note 7     page 229\nPension and other postretirement            Note 8     page 230\nemployee benefit plans\nEmployee share-based incentives             Note 9     page 233\nInvestment securities                       Note 10    page 235\nSecurities financing activities             Note 11    page 240\nLoans                                       Note 12    page 243\nAllowance for credit losses                 Note 13    page 266\nVariable interest entities                  Note 14    page 271\nGoodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and    Note 15    page 280\nother intangible assets\nPremises and equipment                      Note 16    page 285\nLeases                                      Note 18    page 286\nAccounts payable & other liabilities        Note 19    page 288\nLong-term debt                              Note 20    page 289\nEarnings per share                          Note 23    page 294\nIncome taxes                                Note 25    page 296\nOff–balance sheet lending-related\nfinancial instruments, guarantees and       Note 28    page 302\nother commitments\nLitigation                                  Note 30    page 309\n180    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are\npredominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and\nreported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded\nlending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at\nfair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for\nexample, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not\navailable, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant\ntransaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters,\nincluding yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices),\ncorrelations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The\nlevel of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and\nconsistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment\nand may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants\ncompared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the\nreporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for\nassets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group\n(“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible\nfor verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the\nFirm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under\nthe direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, AWM and certain corporate\nfunctions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by\nthe risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where\navailable. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including\nclient unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of\nstructured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and\nloss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review\nfor more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the\nestimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments\nclassified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair value hierarchy on page\n182 for further information). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios\nthat meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows\na consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable\nexternal price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity.\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in\ndetermining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument\nbeing traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of\nreasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial\ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair\nvalue of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction.\nWhere this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal\nmarket-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    181\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nbased on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position,\nincluding the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to sufficiently\nreduce the net open risk position. • Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when\npositions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of\nmarket activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be\nestimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty\ninherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its\nestimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own\ncreditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to\nCredit and funding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for more information on such adjustments. Valuation model\nreview and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is\ngenerally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as\ninputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process\ndescribed above is applied to the inputs in those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to\nimplementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s\npolicy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate\nactions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair value hierarchy\nhas been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based\non the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three\nlevels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for\nidentical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted\nprices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 –\none or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A\nfinancial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\n182    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024

term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge\naccounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities\ninventories have been included in each period presented.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    187\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both December 31, 2024 and\n2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate\nand other funds, were $ 1.0billion, primarily reported in other assets.\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair\nvalue is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181–185 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to\nthe lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of\nsuch inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In\naddition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input\nvalues presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the\ndegree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and\narithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    189\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3\ninputs(…\nDecember\n31, 2024\nFair                 Principal    Unobserv…

Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following\ndiscussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that\naffect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the\ninterest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield,\nin isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the\namount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for\ntaking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security\nprimarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the\ncoupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the\nrange of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit\nspreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a\ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par\nand an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the\nremaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being\npaid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The\nconditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between\nconditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has\nhigh prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in\nthe conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional\ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional\ndefault rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the\ninverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate\nliquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An\nincrease in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in\nvaluing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV\nratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    191\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation\ninputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one\nparameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or\na decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in\nisolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the\nvaluation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of\nthose risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between\ntwo interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as\nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or\nacross asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of\nthe variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular\ninstrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including\nequity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Given a long position in an option, an increase in\nvolatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of\nvolatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including\nthe nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be\nsignificantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the\nstrike price of the option. Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of\na Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption\nand reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent\non market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying\nswap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result\nin an increase in a fair value measurement. Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the\nrelationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash\nflow. Forward price – The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a\nforward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at\ninception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of\nfactors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received\nand costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in\nthe forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair\nvalue measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nfor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. When a determination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable\nor level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to\nexternal sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part\nto observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components\nof level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2\nof the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the\ngains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related\nto such level 3 instruments.\n192    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nFa…                                                                                          Ch…\nva…

These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty\nnonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make\nadjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to\nthe relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA\nusing a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated\nrecovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the\nFirm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i)\nthe probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS\nspreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery\nrates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is\nevidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument.\nThe Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s\npositions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized\nderivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight\nindexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is\nnot necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue\nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality\non the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality\nover time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                             2024            2023           2022\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA                    $  29          $  221          $  22\nDerivatives FVA                       99             114             42\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on\nfair value option elected liabilities reflects changes\n(subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the\nFirm’s probability of default and LGD, which are\nestimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread\nobserved in the bond market.

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect\nthe different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the\nFirm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held\nas of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments\nrecorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are\nincluded in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                         2024              2023\nOther assets\nCarrying value(a)                           $  3,737          $  4,457\nUpward carrying value changes(b)                  89                93\nDownward carrying value                         -286              -325\nchanges/impairment(c)\n(a) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward\ncarrying value changes.\n(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2024 were $ 1.1billion.\n(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2024 were $(\n1.5) billion .\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2 common shares\n(\"Visa B-2 shares\") and 37.2million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) reflected in the Firm's principal\ninvestment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Visa B shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January 24, 2024. On\nApril 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1 shares. On May 6,\n2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2million Visa B-1 shares in exchange\nfor a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in an initial gain\nof $ 8.0billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In addition, the second quarter of 2024 also\nreflected other Visa-related activity, including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative\ninstruments, as well as dividends, resulting in the $ 7.9billion net gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third\nquarters of 2024 and through a $ 1.0billion contribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common\nshares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters\ninvolving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5430at December 31, 2024 and may be\nadjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation\nmatters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown.\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on\nVisa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result\nof these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar\nto Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.\nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative\ninstruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the\nconversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on\nsubsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B\nshares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with\nthe previously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted\nfor at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and\nmagnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading\nliabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. The notional amount of shares associated\nwith those derivative instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31,\n2024, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share\nsales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\n200    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial\ninstruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as\nnonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion\nof management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorganChase. Financial instruments for\nwhich carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature\nand generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks,\nfederal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables\nand accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under\nrepurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair\nvalue of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be\nequal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values\nat December 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDec…                                                   Dec…\n31,                                                    31,\n2024                                                   2023\nEst…                                                   Es…\nfair                                                   fa…\nval…                                                   va…\nhie…                                                   hi…\nTot…                                                 Tot…\n(in       Car…       Lev…       Lev…       Lev…       est…       Car…       Le…       Lev…       Le…       est…\nbi…       val…          1          2          3       fair       val…         1          2         3       fair\nval…                                                 val…\nFi…\nas…\nCa…\nand\ndue    $  23.4    $  23.4    $     —    $     —    $  23.4    $  29.1    $  29…    $     —    $    —    $  29.1\nfr…\nba…\nDe…\nwi…       445…       445…        0.1          —       445…       595…       59…        0.5         —       595…\nba…\nAc…\nin…\nand       101…          —       101…        0.1       101…       107…         —       107…       0.1       107…\nac…\nre…\nFe…\nfu…\nso…\nand\nse…        8.2          —        8.2          —        8.2       16.3         —       16.3         —       16.3\npu…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSe…       135…          —       135…          —       135…       130…         —       130…         —       130…\nbo…\nIn…\nse…       274…       97.4       150…          —       247…       369…       16…       182…         —       342…\nhe…\nLo…\nnet\nof\nal…       1,2…          —       268…       1,0…       1,2…       1,2…         —       285…       96…       1,2…\nfor\nlo…\nlo…\nOt…       82.7          —       81.3        1.6       82.9       76.1         —       74.9       1.4       76.3\nFi…\nli…\nDe…    $  2,3…    $     —    $  2,3…    $     —    $  2,3…    $  2,3…    $    —    $  2,3…    $    —    $  2,3…\nFe…\nfu…\npu…\nand\nse…\nlo…       70.5          —       70.5          —       70.5       47.5         —       47.5         —       47.5\nor\nso…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSh…       26.4          —       26.3          —       26.3       24.7         —       24.7         —       24.7\nbo…\nAc…\npa…\nand       232…          —       219…       12.6       232…       241…         —       233…       8.1       241…\not…\nli…\nBe…\nin…\nis…       27.3          —       27.4          —       27.4       23.0         —       23.0         —       23.0\nby\nco…\nVI…\nLo…       300…          —       251…       50.7       301…       303…         —       252…       51…       303…\nde…\n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,\nincluding expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary\nmarket spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    201\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at\nfair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between\nthe measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an\naccrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as\nwell as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair\nvalue includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing\nactivity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related\ncommitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets\nthat contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a\nderivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial\ninstruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities\nCertain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying\nassets are carried at fair value\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    203\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value\nfor the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are\ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s\ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of\nagreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the\nprincipal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-\nspecific credit risk related to these agreements.\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and long-term\nbeneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nDece…\n31,                                               Fair                                                 Fair\n(in                                              value                                                value\nmill…         2024                              over/…             2023                              over/…\nLoans       Contr…                              contr…           Contr…                              contr…\nNona…       princ…                   Fair       princ…           princ…                   Fair       princ…\nloans       outst…                  value       outst…           outst…                  value       outst…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas       $   3,429              $     464    $  -2,965        $   2,987              $     588    $  -2,399\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans        1,711                  1,492         -219              838                    732         -106\nSubt…        5,140                  1,956       -3,184            3,825                  1,320       -2,505\n90 or\nmore\ndays\npast\ndue\nand\ngove…\nguar…\nLoan…           50                     45           -5               65                     59           -6\nAll\nother\nperf…\nloan…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas          12,171                 10,852       -1,319            9,547                  7,968       -1,579\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoan…       40,342                 39,813         -529           38,948                 38,060         -888\nSubt…       52,513                 50,665       -1,848           48,495                 46,028       -2,467\nTotal    $  57,703              $  52,666    $  -5,037        $  52,385              $  47,407    $  -4,978\nloans\nLong…\ndebt\nPrin…    $  57,414        -e    $  47,780    $  -9,634        $  47,768        -e    $  38,882    $  -8,886\ndebt\nNonp…               NA             53,000               NA               NA             49,042               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $  100,7…               NA               NA          $  87,924               NA\ndebt\nLong…\nbene…\ninte…\nNonp…               NA          $       1               NA               NA          $       1               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $       1               NA               NA          $       1               NA\nbene…\ninte…\n(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies.\n(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.\n(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term\nbeneficial interests.

JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit\nrisk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are\nmanaged primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the\nportfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty\nbasis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,\nsecuritizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular\nloan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.

JPMorganChase makes markets in\nderivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of\nthe Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to\nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or\nselling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk\nmanagement derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments,\nincluding derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the\nrisk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in\nmarket value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of\nvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses\non the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain\nforeign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or\nforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to\nmanage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are\nexpected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are\nused to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the\nCredit derivatives section on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to\nthe risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables\non pages 218–221 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and\nsettlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the\nderivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange\nand cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared\nderivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges\nand clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the\noffsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not\nthe transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as\nhedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 213–221 of this\nNote provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and\nlosses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    209\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorganChase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management\nactivities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk\nof loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For\nthe same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity\nderivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be\ndesignated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must\nidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as\ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those\nterms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS\nsecurities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain\namounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life\nof the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to\nearnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the\nclassification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. The Firm\nemploys the portfolio layer method to manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout\nthe life of the open hedge, basis adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to\nindividual assets under certain circumstances. These include instances where the portfolio amount falls below the\nhedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation. JPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to\nhedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign\ncurrency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts\naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest\nrevenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in\nvalue of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect\nearnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur\naccording to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized\nin earnings. JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net\ninvestment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are\nrecorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded\ndirectly in earnings.\n210    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from\nthe same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been\neither sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those\nderivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).\nThese amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not\neligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are\nshown separately as \"Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets\" in the tables, up to the fair\nvalue exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty\nlevel, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and\ncollateral held or transferred that relates to

It is the policy of JPMorganChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty\ncredit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk,\nas the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as\nthe fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and\nits subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the\ncontract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-\ncleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings\ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2024\nand 2023.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables\ncontaining downgrade triggers\n(in millions)                                  December 31, 2024                 December 31, 2023\nAggregate fair value of net derivative                              $  15,371                         $  14,655\npayables\nCollateral posted                                                      15,204                            14,673\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrelated to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be\ntriggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating\nagency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major\nrating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing\ntransactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale\nand a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management\ncategories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    221\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection\npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments\nunder the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its\nobligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has\nthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is\nboth a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit\nderivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the\nneeds of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives\ncounterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial\ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-\nname”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts.\nSingle-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are\nused to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P\n500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series\nof CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the\nreference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios\nof reference names or against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide protection against the first $\n1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as\ntranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event,\nunder the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The\nprotection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS\ncontract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known\nas the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying\nreference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related\nnotes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-\nrelated note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the\ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in\nreturn, the issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The\nissuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the\nentities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the\nissuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference\nbetween the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following\ntables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically\npay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid\non the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement.

The related contracts are\noften terminable on demand and the Firm has no\nremaining obligation to deliver future services. For\narrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue associated\nwith these remaining performance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future events or\nunderlying asset values, and is not recognized until\nthe outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue category includes\ndebt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via\npublic offering and private placement of various types\nof debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are recognized as\nrevenue typically upon execution of the client’s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan\narrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees,\nincluded within debt underwriting fees, are recorded\nas revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing\nand yield criteria.

In\nconnection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments,\nderivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference\ncommodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:\nderivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and\nforeign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit,\nforeign exchange and interest rate risks.

The cost to the Firm related to\nthese proprietary rewards programs varies based on\nmultiple factors including the terms and conditions of\nthe rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder\nreward redemption rates and cardholder reward\nselections. The Firm maintains a liability for its\nobligations under its rewards programs and reports the\ncurrent-period cost as a reduction of card income.\nCredit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has\ncontractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners\nthat grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-\nbranded credit card products and market them to the\ncustomers of such partners. These partners endorse the\nco-brand credit card programs and provide their\ncustomer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may\nalso conduct marketing activities and provide rewards\nredeemable under their own loyalty programs that the\nFirm will grant to co-brand credit cardholders based\non account activity. The terms of these agreements\ngenerally range from fiveto ten years. The Firm\ntypically makes payments to the co-brand credit card\npartners based on the cost of partners’ marketing\nactivities and loyalty program rewards provided to\ncredit cardholders, new account originations and sales\nvolumes. Payments to partners based on marketing\nefforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the\nFirm as incurred and reported as marketing expense.\nPayments for partner loyalty program rewards are\nreported as a reduction of card income when incurred.\nPayments to partners based on new credit card account\noriginations are accounted for as direct loan\norigination costs and are deferred and recognized as a\nreduction of card income on a straight-line basis over\na 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales\nvolumes are reported as a reduction of card income\nwhen the related interchange income is earned.\nThe following table presents the components of card\nincome:\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                      2024                2023                2022\nInterchange and merchant processing    $   33,847          $   31,021          $   28,085\nincome\nReward costs and partner payments         -26,784             -24,601             -22,162\nAll other(a)                               -1,566              -1,636              -1,503\nTotal card income                      $    5,497          $    4,784          $    4,420\n(a) Predominantly represents the amortization of\naccount origination costs and annual fees, which are\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\na 12-month period.

Interest income and interest expense includes the current-period\ninterest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and certain financial\ninstruments containing embedded derivatives; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any\ninterest elements, are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not\nmeasured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable.\nInterest income and interest expense also includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting\nwhere applicable. Interest income on loans and securities include the amortization and accretion of purchase\npremiums and discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on loans. These amounts are deferred in loans and\ninvestment securities, respectively, and recognized on a level-yield basis.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new\nparticipants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S.\nemployees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1,\n2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts\nbased on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that\nprovide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered\nunder these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements\nin certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the\n401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k)\nSavings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit\ncontributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts\nrecorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB\nplans.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                           2024                2023\nProjected benefit obligations               $  -14,459          $  -14,740\nFair value of plan assets                       22,201              22,013\nNet funded status                                7,742               7,273\nAccumulated other comprehensive                 -1,649              -1,517\nincome/(loss)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was\n5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in\nOCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent\nperiods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected\nbenefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected\nremaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended December 31,\n2024, the net loss was attributable to lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by projected\nbenefit obligation net gains primarily related to changes in the discount rate. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets, partially offset\nby changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the\ndefined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)                2024            2023              2022\nTotal net periodic defined benefit plan    $   -462        $   -393          $   -192          -b\ncost/(credit)(a)\nTotal defined contribution plans              1,733           1,609             1,408\nTotal pension and OPEB cost included in    $  1,271        $  1,216          $  1,216\nnoninterest expense\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive    $    131        $   -421          $  1,459\n(income)/loss\n(a) The service cost component of net periodic defined benefit cost is reported in compensation expense; all other\ncomponents of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of\nincome.\n(b) Includes pension settlement losses of $ 92million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n230    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit\ncosts for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nYear ended December 31,                 2024       2023       2022\nDiscount rate                           5.16  %    5.14  %    2.54  %\nExpected long-term rate of return on    6.15  %    5.74  %    3.68  %\nplan assets\nPlan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of\nreturn is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for the\nvarious asset classes, taking into consideration local\nmarket conditions and the specific allocation of plan\nassets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a\nforward-looking approach and are not strictly based on\nhistorical returns, with consideration given to\ncurrent market conditions and the portfolio mix of\neach plan. The discount rates used in determining the\nbenefit obligations are generally provided by the\nFirm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by\nreference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with\nmaturity dates and coupons that closely match the\nplan’s projected annual cash flows.\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in\nvarious trusts and are invested in well-diversified\nportfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash\nand cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The\nFirm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset\nmanagers, as well as other factors that could impact\nthe portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed\nnecessary.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2024, 81million shares of common stock were available for\nissuance through May 2028. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based\nincentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs\nare awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate\nof 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting\ndate. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to\nvest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and\nother restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may\nresult in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to\nreceive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs\nare outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject\nto the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-yearperiod. The number of awards that vest\ncan range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are\nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted\ninto shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the\nshares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional\nholding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately fiveto eight yearsfrom the grant\ndate depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were\ngranted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorganChase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs\nexpire ten yearsafter the grant date. There were nogrants of SARs in 2024, 2023 or 2022. The Firm separately\nrecognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a\nseparate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized\non a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the\nemployees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility\nprovisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value\nof awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of\npost-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the\nvesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier\nof the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for\nissuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common\nstock or treasury shares. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by\nissuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for\npurposes of calculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    233\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by\nthe stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation\nmodel. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.

Debt securities classified as\ntrading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury\nand CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities are carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or\nallowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried\nat amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM\nsecurities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over\nthe contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    235\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates\nindicated.\nDec…\n31,\n(in\nmil…\nAva…\nsec…        2024       Gross       Gross                    2023        Gross       Gross\nMor…       Amor…       unre…       unre…        Fair       Amor…       unrea…       unre…    Fair\nsec…       cost…       gains       loss…       value       cost…        gains       loss…    value\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand     $  95,6…    $    251    $  4,029    $  91,8…    $  88,3…    $     870    $  4,077             $  85,170\ngov…\nage…\nRes…\nU.S.       4,242          16          50       4,208       2,086           10          68                 2,028\nNon…         600           3           —         603       1,608            4           1                 1,611\nCom…       4,115          20          70       4,065       2,930           12         139                 2,803\nTot…\nmor…       104,…         290       4,149       100,…       95,0…          896       4,285                91,612\nsec…\nU.S.\nTre…\nand        235,…         545       1,261       234,…       58,0…          276         522                57,805\ngov…\nage…\nObl…\nof\nU.S.       18,3…         110         534       17,9…       21,2…          390         266                21,367\nsta…\nand\nmun…\nNon…\ngov…       36,6…          94         504       36,2…       21,3…          254         359                21,282\ndebt\nsec…\nCor…\ndebt          71           —           1          70         128            —          28                   100\nsec…\nAss…\nsec…\nCol…\nloan       14,8…          59           3       14,9…       6,769           11          28                 6,752\nobl…\nOth…       2,125          17           9       2,133       2,804            8          26                 2,786\nUna…\npor…\nlay…\nfair       -1,1…           —       -1,1…          NA          73          -73           —                    NA\nval…\nbas…\nadj…\nTot…\nava…       411,…       1,115       5,308       406,…       205,…        1,762       5,514                201,7…\nsec…\nHel…\nsec…\nMor…\nsec…\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand        97,1…           6       13,5…       83,6…       105,…           39       11,6…                94,010\ngov…\nage…\nU.S.       8,605           4         904       7,705       9,709            4         970                 8,743\nRes…\nCom…       8,817          24         389       8,452       10,5…           13         581                 9,966\nTot…\nmor…       114,…          34       14,8…       99,8…       125,…           56       13,1…                112,7…\nsec…\nU.S.\nTre…\nand        108,…           —       11,2…       97,4…       173,…            —       13,0…                160,5…\ngov…\nage…\nObl…\nof\nU.S.       9,310          32         631       8,711       9,945           74         591                 9,428\nsta…\nand\nmun…\nAss…\nsec…\nCol…\nloan       40,5…          84          14       40,6…       58,5…           47         352                58,260\nobl…\nOth…       1,354           2          39       1,317       1,815            1          61                 1,755\nTot…\nhel…       274,…         152       26,7…       247,…       369,…          178       27,2…                342,7…\nsec…\nTot…\ninv…\nsec…\nnet\nof      $  685,…    $  1,267    $  32,0…    $  654,…    $  575,…    $   1,940    $  32,7…             $  544,4…\nall…\nfor\ncre…\nlos…\n(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed\nportfolio.

The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and\nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default\n(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at\nacquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the\nlife of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm\nhas the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment\nloss is recognized in investment securities\ngains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and is equal to the full difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and\nthe fair value of the security. For impaired debt\nsecurities that the Firm has the intent and ability to\nhold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a\ncredit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit\nloss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance\nfor credit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on\ndebt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded\nin OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses\ninclude adverse conditions specifically related to the\nindustry, geographic area or financial condition of\nthe issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and\npayment structure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess spread,\novercollateralization or other forms of credit\nenhancement, and compares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the\nlevel of credit enhancement in the securitization\nstructure to determine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a\ncredit loss exists. For beneficial interests in\nsecuritizations that are rated below “AA” at their\nacquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or\notherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would\nnot recover substantially all of its recorded\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit\nlosses when there is an adverse change in expected\ncash flows. HTM securities – credit risk Allowance for\ncredit losses The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities represents expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the securities. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities is calculated by applying\nstatistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD)\nto the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are\nderived using a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation\nto revert to long run historical information for\nperiods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13\nfor further information on the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S.\nresidential mortgage-backed securities is calculated\nas the difference between the amortized cost and the\npresent value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the security’s effective\ninterest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed\nbased on expectations of underlying collateral\nperformance derived using the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as considering the\nstructural features of the security. The application\nof different inputs and assumptions into the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is\nsubject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or\nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect\nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities. Credit quality indicator The primary\ncredit quality indicator for HTM securities is the\nrisk rating assigned to each security.At both December\n31, 2024 and 2023, all HTM securities were rated\ninvestment grade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 99% rated at least AA+ (based upon\nexternal ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities was $ 152million, $ 128million\nand $ 96million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, which included a cumulative-effect\nadjustment to retained earnings related to the\ntransfer of HTM securities to AFS for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio\nhedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal\nprepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected\nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield\nis calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 49million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.2) billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 103million at December 31, 2024.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    239\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,\n“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover\nshort sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s\nexcess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the\nsame counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets\nand liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the\nlife of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm\nhas elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option\nhas been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,\nwith changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for\nhybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024\nand 2023. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)\nthat it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged\ncollateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin\nlevels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the\npermissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash\nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to\nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It\nis also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in\nsecurities financing agreements.\n240    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December\n31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the\neconomic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet\npresentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master\nnetting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or\nobtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where\nthe Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can\nbe pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and\nthe obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nDecember 31,\n2024\nAmounts             Amounts        Amounts not\nnetted on the        presented on        nettable on\n(in                Gross amounts        Consolidated                 the                the                 Net\nmillions)                                    balance        Consolidated       Consolidated          amounts(c)\nsheets             balance            balance\nsheets          sheets(b)\nAssets\nSecurities\npurchased       $        607,154    $       -312,183    $        294,971    $      -282,220    $         12,751\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               267,917             -48,371             219,546           -170,702              48,844\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        603,683    $       -312,183    $        291,500    $      -249,763    $         41,737\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                58,989             -48,371              10,618            -10,557                  61\nother(a)\nDecember 31,\n2023\nAmounts             Amounts        Amounts not\nnetted on the        presented on        nettable on\n(in                Gross amounts        Consolidated                 the                the                 Net\nmillions)                                    balance        Consolidated       Consolidated          amounts(c)\nsheets             balance            balance\nsheets          sheets(b)\nAssets\nSecurities\npurchased       $        523,308    $       -247,181    $        276,127    $      -267,582    $          8,545\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               244,046             -43,610             200,436           -144,543              55,893\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        459,985    $       -247,181    $        212,804    $      -182,011    $         30,793\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                52,142             -43,610               8,532             -8,501                  31\nother(a)\n(a) Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $ 5.9billion and $ 5.6billion at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.\n(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that\ncounterparty.

The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n“retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of\nthe Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment,\nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign\nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on\nperforming loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are recognized in\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued\ninterest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then\nrecognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit\nlosses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not\nrecognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them\noff no later than 90days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on\nwhich the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment\nof principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has\nbeen in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment\nis due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual\nstatus. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed\nagainst interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on\nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded\nloan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the\nrecorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest\nincome on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the\nterms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from\nbeing placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue\nuntil the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents\nthe estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses resulting from lending-related activity, macroeconomic variables, changes\nin credit and other inputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of\nincome. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan\nlosses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or\nthe net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an\noffset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards\nestablished by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking\nloans are generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans,\nincluding modified credit card\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    243\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\naccounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain consumer loans are\ncharged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the\nfollowing circumstances: • Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are determined to be\ncollateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or\nhighly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are\ncharged off or charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon\nrepossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize\ncharge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly\ncertain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many\nfactors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring\nof the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower\nof its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the\nfair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the\ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes.\nFor illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation\nsources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s\nprice opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation\n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12months, or more frequently depending on various\nmarket factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by\ntaking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that\nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted\nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans,\ncollateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values\nare typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans\nheld-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded\nin noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans,\nthe valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts\nor premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and\ndiscounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s\nnonaccrual policies. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at\nfair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued\nand recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized\nin the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are\nsubject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair\nvalue accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried\nat fair value and classified as trading assets.\n244    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-\nrelated losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to\nchanges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event\nthat management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to\nmodify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorganChase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the\nFirm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments\nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays\nor principal forgiveness. Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual\nstatus, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may\nbe returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the\nborrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm\nhas an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s\ndebt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations.\nIn certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans\nare not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. The allowance for credit losses associated with\nFDMs is measured using the Firm’s established allowance methodology, which considers the expected default rates for\nthe modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from\nborrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property\n(e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles,\naircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a\nloan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm\ngenerally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure\ntransaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets\nand initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired\nproperty is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair\nvalue are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance,\nare charged to other expense.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    245\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to\ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

These loans include home equity loans\nsecured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an\ninterest-only payment period, and certain payment-\noption loans that may result in negative amortization.\nThe following table provides information about\nretained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by\nclass.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                          2024              2023\nResidential real estate    $  309,513        $  326,409\nAuto and other                 66,821            70,866\nTotal retained loans       $  376,334        $  397,275\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30days past\ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable\nor unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely\nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater\nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar\nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary\nbased on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or\nthe combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the\nevent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit\npayment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher\nrisk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a\nlow FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit\nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights\ninto the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\n248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate\nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

Loans\nin a trial payment period continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with the original contractual\nterms. At the completion of a trial period, the loan\nmodification is considered permanent.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not\nTDRs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, auto and other TDRs were not material.\n254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nCredit card loan portfolio\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency\nrates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that\nborrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been\ndelinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the\ngeographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does\nnot view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a\nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the\nportfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random\nsample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the\nindustry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the\ncardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency and gross charge-offs.\n(in millions, except ratios)                         December 31, 2024\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due      $                  226,532     $  1,284     $  227,816\nand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                           2,291          109          2,400\n90 or more days past due and still                               2,591           53          2,644\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                  231,414     $  1,446     $  232,860\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                          2.11  %     11.20  %        2.17  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                          1.12         3.67           1.14\nloans\nGross charge-offs                           $                    7,951     $    247     $    8,198\n(in millions, except ratios)                         December 31, 2023\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due      $                  205,731     $    882     $  206,613\nand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                           2,217           84          2,301\n90 or more days past due and still                               2,169           40          2,209\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                  210,117     $  1,006     $  211,123\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                          2.09  %     12.33  %        2.14  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                          1.03         3.98           1.05\nloans\nGross charge-offs                           $                    5,325     $    166     $    5,491\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    255\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)                           December 31, 2024              December 31, 2023\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia                                 $   36,385                     $   32,652\nTexas                                          24,423                         22,086\nNew York                                       18,525                         16,915\nFlorida                                        17,236                         15,103\nIllinois                                       12,442                         11,364\nNew Jersey                                      9,644                          8,688\nOhio                                            6,976                          6,424\nColorado                                        6,962                          6,307\nPennsylvania                                    6,558                          6,088\nArizona                                         5,796                          5,209\nAll other                                      87,913                         80,287\nTotal retained loans                       $  232,860                     $  211,123\nPercentage of portfolio based on\ncarrying value with estimated refreshed\nFICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660                     85.5  %                        85.8  %\nLess than 660                                    14.3                           14.0\nNo FICO available                                 0.2                            0.2\n(a) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at December 31, 2024.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These\nmodifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for\n60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not\nmake the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and\nwill be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not\nreinstate the borrower's line of credit.\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on retained credit card FDMs.\nYear ended December\n31,\n(in millions)            Loan modifications  2024                            2023\nTerm extension and\ninterest rate\nreduction(a)(b)\nAmortized cost basis                               $                    926        $                     648\n% of total\nmodifications to\ntotal                                                                  0.40  %                          0.31  %\nretained credit card\nloans\nTerm extension with a            Term extension with a\nreduction in the                 reduction in the\nFinancial effect of                                        weighted average                 weighted average\nloan modifications                                     contractual interest             contractual interest\nrate from23.64%                  rate from23.19%\nto3.20%                          to3.64%\n(a) Term extension includes credit card loans whose terms have been modified under long-term programs by placing\nthe customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan.\n(b) The interest rates represent weighted average at the time of modification.\n256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nPayment status of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on the\npayment status of retained credit card FDMs during the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                Amortized cost basis  2024          2023\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due    $                   811        $  558\nand still accruing\n30-89 days past due and still accruing                         74            59\n90 or more days past due and still                             41            31\naccruing\nTotal                                     $                   926        $  648\nDefaults of FDMs Retained credit card FDMs that\ndefaulted during the year ended December 31, 2024 and\nthat were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior\nto the default were not material.

Defaulted\nmodified credit card loans remain in the modification\nprogram and continue to be charged off in accordance\nwith the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.\nFinancial effects of TDRs and defaults For periods\nending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of\ncredit card loans where the Firm granted concessions\nto borrowers who were experiencing financial\ndifficulty were generally accounted for and reported\nas TDRs. The Firm granted concessions for most of the\ncredit card loans under long-term programs. These\nconcessions involved placing the customer’s credit\ncard account on a fixed payment plan, generally for\n60months, and typically included reducing the interest\nrate on the credit card account. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm’s long-term programs were\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that were not considered\nconcessions were not reported as TDRs.\nThe following table provides information about the\nfinancial effects of the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and defaults for the\nperiods presented.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the\ninternal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the\nlikelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the\ndefault of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.\nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt\ncapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the\nlevel and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor\noperates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and\nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical\nexperiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics\nequivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-\ninvestment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and\nthe criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s\nassessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized\nloans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional\ninformation. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as\nnecessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the\nrisk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall\ncredit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client\nexposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4\nfor further detail on industry concentrations.\n258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nInternal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.

Additional commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in Secured by real estate were not material at each period.\nNature and extent of TDRs\nPrior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided\nvarious concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm\nelected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $ 801million. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022\nreflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the\nFirm.\nAs a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or\ninvolves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered\nTDRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    265\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • the allowance for loan losses,\nwhich covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses\nis complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller\nof the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and\nother factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future\nperiods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related\ncommitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to\ndetermine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are\nnot unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally\ncancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance\non other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90days past\ndue by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual\nterm, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of\nfunded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account,\nand determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the\nbalance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the\npayment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009,\ngenerally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes\nexpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result\nin a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk\ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively,\nconsidering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will\ndeteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment.\nEmphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.\nRelevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO\nscores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics\nfor the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,\ngeography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the\nFirm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively\nassessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans,\nperforming risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk\ncharacteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis,\nconsidering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The\nasset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that\nconsiders the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The\nquantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by\napplying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the\n266    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nprobability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-\nquarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse,\nrelative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios\ntake into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across\nthe Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management\nacross LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\nreflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in\nmaking this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political\nconditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an\nindustry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit\nquality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by\nmanagement to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine\nthe asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which\nforeclosure is probable) and nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated\nindividually. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell, as\napplicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the\nloan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries\nof prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of the collateral). For non-collateral\ndependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized\ncost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s\neffective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the\nallowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans\nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates,\nprincipal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to\nrepay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as\nthese cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing\nof interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of\ncurrent and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of\ncurrent overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of\ninsolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. Other financial\nassets In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial assets that are measured at\namortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit exposures arising from lending activities\nsubject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management estimates the allowance for other financial assets using\nvarious techniques considering historical losses and current economic conditions. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term\nnature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s\nobligation to provide additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these exposures generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, management may also\nconsider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements,\nor whether collateral is significantly concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar risk\ncharacteristics. If in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the\nFirm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    267\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses and includes a breakdown of loans and\nlending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: • $ 2.1billion in\nconsumer , reflecting: – a $ 2.2billion net addition in Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth,\nreflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, partially\noffset by – a $ 125million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and • a net reduction of $\n30million in wholesale , reflecting: – changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an update to loss assumptions on\ncertain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely from collateral-dependent loans, predominantly\noffset by – net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the impact of incorporating the First Republic\nportfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second quarter of 2024. The Firm’s qualitative\nadjustments continued to include additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties\nand downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table\nbelow, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and\na weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter\nof 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2023\n2Q24       4Q24       2Q25\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated\nas the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from\nthe prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments\nwith the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper\nconduit.\nLine of Business               Transaction Type                 Activity                        2024 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB                            Credit card securitization       Securitization of originated    pages 271–272\ntrusts                           credit card receivables\nServicing and securitization\nMortgage securitization        of both originated and           pages 272–274\ntrusts                         purchased residential\nmortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other               originated and purchased\nCIB                            securitization trusts            residential and commercial      pages 272–274\nmortgages, and other\nconsumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits          markets in a cost-efficient      page 274\nmanner and structuring\ntransactions to meet investor\nneeds\nMunicipal bond vehicles        Financing of municipal bond      pages 274–275\ninvestments\nThe Firm’s other business segments and Corporate are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored),\nbut to a lesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is\ncompetitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to\nbe significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCorporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are\ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of\ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties\nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not\nhave the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these\nentities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third\nparties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily\nthrough the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain\nsenior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and\nliabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these\nsecuritization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing\nresponsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those\ntrusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other\ncontinuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm\nthe right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying\nsecuritized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of\nthe beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other\nobligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts\nrequire the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December\n31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $\n6.6billion and $ 4.9billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal\nreceivables owned by\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    271\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nthose trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Firm\ndid not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit\ncard securitization trusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card\ntrusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization\ntrusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial\nmortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular\ntransaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or\nretain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.

The retained interests in prime residential\nmortgages consisted of $ 2.9billion and $ 2.5billion of investment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and $ 216million and $ 88million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $\n6.0billion and $ 6.1billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $ 1.4billion and $ 1.7billion of\nnoninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n272    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential\nmortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased from third\nparties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains\nservicing for all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for certain mortgage\nloans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is\nresponsible for decisions related to loan\nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization\ntrusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior\nand/or subordinated interests (including residual\ninterests and amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization, and/or\nreacquires positions in the secondary market in the\nnormal course of business. In certain instances, as a\nresult of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered\ntogether with the servicing arrangements entered into\nby CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm\ndoes not consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-\nsponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore\ndoes not have the power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and\nother consumer securitizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in\nunderwriting and trading activities involving the\nsecurities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may\nretain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests\n(including amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization but,\ngenerally, the Firm does not service commercial loan\nsecuritizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest\nin these securitizations as well. For commercial\nmortgage securitizations the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE generally is held by\nthe servicer or investors in a specified class of\nsecurities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally\ndoes not retain an interest in the controlling class\nin its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization\ntransactions.\nRe-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-\nsecuritization transactions in which debt securities\nare transferred to a VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential\nmortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is\nlargely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in\nthe re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of\nsecurities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                   2024               2023               2022\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  44,456          $  18,864          $  16,128\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort\nand decisions in establishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the significant\neconomic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did\nnot transfer any private label securities to re-\nsecuritization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, and\nretained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not material.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial\ninterests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations\nand generally purchases these interests in the\nsecondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm\ndoes not have the unilateral ability to direct the\nmost significant activities of the re-securitization\ntrust, either because it was not involved in the\ninitial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved\nwith an independent third-party sponsor and\ndemonstrated shared power over the creation of the\ntrust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the\nre-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    273\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's\ninterests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                      Nonconsolidated\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies  2024     re-securitization VIEs    2023\nInterest in VIEs                         $                   3,219          $  3,371\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization\nVIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit\nentities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of\nreceivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities\nthrough the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is\nthe cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit\nenhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit\nenhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and\nare typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements\nmitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the\ncommercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the\nconduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a\nminimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities\nand program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit\nenhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of\ncommercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power\nto direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding\nasset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s\ninterests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and\nliquidity and program-wide\ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement\nfacilities provided to the conduits. In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes markets in and invests\nin commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 2.9billion and $\n9.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding\nneeds and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant\nto credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper\nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity\nand credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 10.3billion and $ 10.8billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to\nextend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their\nmunicipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated\nmunicipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable\nfloating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The\nfloaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with\nrequisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal\nbond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as\ncustomer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm.\nCustomer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters\nfor TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters,\nconducting the initial\n274    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nplacement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in\nfloaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2024 and 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The\nliquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”),\nwhich include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of\ntaxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In\naddition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the\nunderlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the\nreimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to\nthe TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the\nliquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it\ndirectly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm\nconsolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive\nbenefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLiabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,                                                                        intere…\n2024          Assets                                                            in\n(in          Trading                                           Total           VIE                        Total\nmilli…        assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…       assets…       Other(f)       liabil…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $  13,531          $      168    $    13,699    $    5,312    $        10    $    5,322\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             1       20,383                 133         20,517        18,228             26        18,254\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           3,388            —                  22          3,410         3,617             15         3,632\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          630                   8            638           115             48           163\nentit…\nOther            496        1,966    -b           350          2,812            51            355           406\nTotal     $    3,885    $  36,510          $      681    $    41,076    $   27,323    $       454    $   27,777\nAssets                                                       Liabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,          Trading                                           Total       intere…                        Total\n2023          assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…            in       Other(f)       liabil…\n(in                                                                            VIE\nmilli…                                                                     assets…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $   9,460          $      117    $     9,577    $    2,998    $         6    $    3,004\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             1       27,372                 194         27,567        17,781             30        17,811\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,056            —                  22          2,078         2,116             11         2,127\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          693                   8            701           125             57           182\nentit…\nOther            113           86                 250            449             —            159           159\nTotal     $    2,170    $  37,611          $      591    $    40,372    $   23,020    $       263    $   23,283\n(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities.

The holders of these beneficial\ninterests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase.

These transactions are conducted\nat arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are\nbased on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into\nconsideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest\nthat could potentially be significant, the Firm\ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records\nand reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and\nreport positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds\ninvestments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles,\nwhich are limited partnerships and similar entities\nthat own and operate affordable housing, alternative\nenergy, and other projects. These entities are\nprimarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically\nthe general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit\nvehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and\nearns a return primarily through the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss\nexposure, represented by equity investments and\nfunding commitments, was $ 35.2billion and $\n35.1billion, of which $ 15.0billion and $ 14.7billion\nwas unfunded at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The Firm assesses each project and to\nreduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts\nof its capital investment until the project qualifies\nfor tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information\non off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to\nthe Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\nguidance which expanded the types of tax-oriented\ninvestments, beyond affordable housing tax credit\ninvestments, that the Firm can elect on a program by\nprogram basis, to be accounted for using the\nproportional amortization method. Refer to Notes 1, 6\nand 25 for further information. The proportional\namortization method requires the cost of eligible\ninvestments, within an elected program, be amortized\nin proportion to the tax benefits received with the\nresulting amortization reported directly in income tax\nexpense, which aligns with the associated tax credits\nand other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain\ncriteria to be eligible,\nincluding that substantially all of the return is from\nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits. In\naddition, under this method deferred taxes are\ngenerally not recorded as the investment is now\namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and\nother income tax benefits received. Delayed equity\ncontributions that are unconditional and legally\nbinding or conditional and probable of occurring are\nrecorded in other liabilities with a corresponding\nincrease in the carrying value of the investment. The\nguidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible\ninvestments when significant modifications or events\noccur that result in a change in the nature of the\ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with\nthe underlying project. During the period, there were\nno significant modifications or events that resulted\nin a change in the nature of an eligible investment or\na change in the Firm's relationship with the\nunderlying project.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to\napply the proportional amortization method.\nAlternative energy and affordable\nYear ended December 31,                                               housing\n(in millions)                     2024                            programs(d)  2023             2022\nPrograms for which the Firm\nelected\nproportional amortization:\nCarrying value(a)                       $                              31,978        $  14,644        $  12,052\nTax credits and other tax                                               6,379            2,044            1,786\nbenefits(b)\nInvestments that qualify to be\naccounted\nfor using proportional\namortization:\nAmortization losses recognized\nas a                                                                   -5,018           -1,561           -1,353\ncomponent of income tax expense\nNon-income-tax-related\ngains/(losses)\nand other returns received that                                           142               -1               -1\nare\nrecognized outside of income tax\nexpense(c)\n(a) Recorded in Other assetson the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,\nas liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,\nupon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.\nThe Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make\ndecisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum\nexposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $ 5.8billion and $\n5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 8.1billion\nand $ 7.3billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,\nincluding residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The\npurposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the\nFirm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the\ntransfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are\nmet: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or\nbeneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not\nmaintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred\nassets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the\ntransferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on\nthe difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets\nreceived) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in\nnoninterest revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    277\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,                   2024       Commercial             2023       Commercial             2022       Commercial\n(in             Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and\nmillions)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)\nPrincipal    $      19,988    $      17,683    $       7,678    $       3,901    $      10,218    $       9,036\nsecuriti…\nAll cash\nflows\nduring\nthe\nperiod:(…\nProceeds\nreceived\nfrom loan    $      19,870    $      17,346    $       7,251    $       3,896    $       9,783    $       8,921\nsales as\nfinancial\ninstrume…\nServicing\nfees                    35               35               24                5               62                2\ncollected\nCash\nflows\nreceived               405            1,303              325              425              489              285\non\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Primarily includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These\nloans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the\npurpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who\nprovide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit\nenhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans\ninto securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie\nMae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or\nguaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm\ndoes not consolidate the securitization vehicles\nunderlying these transactions as it is not the primary\nbeneficiary.

The goodwill\nimpairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying\nvalue. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not\nto be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the amount\nby which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a\nproxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit\nequity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a\nvariety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is\nreviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating Committee. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the\nfair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period\nand uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are\nbased on the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate.\nThe discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit\nand is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher\nlevels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess\nthe reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the\nestimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In\naddition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s\noverall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis\nare then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and\ntransaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair\nvalues, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that\n280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nnaturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. The Firm also takes into consideration a\ncomparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorganChase’s market\ncapitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium\nthat would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at\nthe Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other\nfactors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in business\nperformance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or\nmarket conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity,\ncould cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in\na material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nMortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing\nactivities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by\nestimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either\npurchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as\na single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its\nMSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair\nvalue of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest\nrate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic\nfactors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also\nconsiders recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    281\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs\ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase\nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.\nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorganChase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is\nto offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related\nrisk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)                                                 2024               2023              2022\nFair value at beginning of period           $   8,522          $   7,973          $  5,494\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                              325                253               798\nPurchase of MSRs(a)                               601              1,028             1,400\nDisposition of MSRs(b)                            -21               -188              -822\nNet additions/(dispositions)                      905              1,093             1,376\nChanges due to collection/realization of       -1,068             -1,011              -936\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and          670                424             2,022\nother(c)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to               102                -22                14\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                     14                 14                 —\nPrepayment model changes and other(d)             -24                 51                 3\nTotal changes in valuation due to other            92                 43                17\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs          762                467             2,039\nand assumptions\nFair value at December 31,                  $   9,121          $   8,522          $  7,973\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $     762          $     467          $  2,039\nat December 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and         1,606              1,590             1,535\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at            652                632               584\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at December            577                659               758\n31(e)\n(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid\nwithin 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.\n(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities\n(“SMBS”).

The Firm also capitalizes certain costs\nassociated with the acquisition or development of\ninternal-use software. Once the software is ready for\nits intended use, these costs are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the software’s expected\nuseful life. The estimated useful lives range from\n10to 50years for buildings and leasehold improvements,\nand 3to 10years for internal-use software and\nfurniture and equipment.\nImpairment is assessed when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset may not be fully recoverable.\nNote 17 – Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing deposits were as follows:\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nU.S. offices                                             2024                  2023\nNoninterest-bearing (included$28,904and    $    592,500          $    643,748\n$75,393at fair value)(a)\nInterest-bearing (included$1,101and           1,345,914             1,303,100\n$573at fair value)(a)\nTotal deposits in U.S. offices                1,938,414             1,946,848\nNon-U.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing (included$2,255and           26,806                23,097\n$1,737at fair value)(a)\nInterest-bearing (included$1,508and             440,812               430,743\n$681at fair value)(a)\nTotal deposits in non-U.S. offices              467,618               453,840\nTotal deposits                             $  2,406,032          $  2,400,688\n(a) Includes structured notes classified as deposits\nfor which the fair value option has been elected.\nRefer to Note 3 for further discussion.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, time deposits in\ndenominations that met or exceeded the insured limit\nwere as follows:\nDecember 31, (in millions)                2024                2023\nU.S. offices                  $  149,239          $  132,654\nNon-U.S. offices(a)               92,639              90,187\nTotal                         $  241,878          $  222,841\n(a) Represents all time deposits in non-U.S. offices\nas these deposits typically exceed the insured limit.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining maturities of\ninterest-bearing time deposits were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)    U.S.                  Non-U.S.                 Total\n2025                     $  222,676                $  89,427             $  312,103\n2026                            749                       87                    836\n2027                            482                        2                    484\n2028                            149                       18                    167\n2029                            314                      721                  1,035\nAfter 5 years                   162                      129                    291\nTotal                    $  224,532                $  90,384             $  314,916\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    285\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 18 - Leases\nFirm as lessee At December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of\nnoncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business\npurposes. These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the\nlease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain\nthat it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease\nliability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on\nthe Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease\nagreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on\nmaintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and\nnon-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent\npayments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the\nlease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The\nfuture lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for\nfinancing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating\nlease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus\ninitial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income.\nThe carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases\nwere as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted)\n2024                                              2023\nRight-of-use assets                            $        8,494  $        8,431\nLease liabilities                                       8,900           8,833\nWeighted average remaining lease term                     8.3             8.4\n(in years)\nWeighted average discount rate                    4.24      %     4.01      %\nSupplemental cash flow information\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities -             $        1,734  $        1,662\noperating cash flows\nSupplemental non-cash information\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange       $        1,565  $        2,094\nfor operating lease obligations\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                        2024            2023\nRental expense\nGross rental expense       $  2,231        $  2,079\nSublease rental income          -41             -72\nNet rental expense         $  2,190        $  2,007\nThe following table presents future payments under\noperating leases as of December 31, 2024.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2025                                       1,709\n2026                                       1,553\n2027                                       1,412\n2028                                       1,248\n2029                                       1,048\nAfter 2029                                 3,721\nTotal future minimum lease payments       10,691\nLess: Imputed interest                    -1,791\nTotal                                  $   8,900\nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31,\n2024, the Firm had additional future operating lease\ncommitments of $ 887million that were signed but had\nnot yet commenced.

The\nFirm’s lease financings are predominantly auto\noperating leases. These assets subject to operating\nleases are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the\nasset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation\nexpense is included in technology, communications and\nequipment expense in the Consolidated statements of\nincome. The Firm’s lease income is generally\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm and is included in other income in the\nConsolidated statements of income. On a periodic\nbasis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment,\nand if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds\nthe undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments\nand the estimated residual value upon disposition of\nthe leased asset, an impairment is recognized. The\nrisk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets\nrelating to the residual value of the leased assets is\nmonitored through projections of the asset residual\nvalues at lease origination and periodic review of\nresidual values, and is mitigated through arrangements\nwith certain manufacturers or lessees.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of\nassets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                      2024             2023\nCarrying value of assets subject to\noperating leases, net of accumulated    $  12,988        $  10,663\ndepreciation\nAccumulated depreciation                    2,509            3,288\nThe following table presents the Firm’s operating\nlease income and the related depreciation expense on\nthe Consolidated statements of income.\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)              2024            2023            2022\nOperating lease income                   $  2,795        $  2,843        $  3,654\nDepreciation expense                        1,685           1,778           2,475\nThe following table presents future receipts under\noperating leases as of December 31, 2024.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2025                                      2,381\n2026                                      1,707\n2027                                        704\n2028                                         47\n2029                                          5\nAfter 2029                                    4\nTotal future minimum lease receipts    $  4,848\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    287\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 19 – Accounts payable and other liabilities\nAccounts payable and other liabilities consist of brokerage payables, which include payables to customers and\npayables related to security purchases that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, such as compensation\naccruals, credit card rewards liability, merchant servicing payables, operating lease liabilities, accrued interest\npayables, income tax payables and litigation reserves.\nThe following table presents the components of accounts payable and other liabilities.\nDecember 31, (in millions)                       2024                2023\nBrokerage payables                   $  153,153          $  161,960\nOther payables and liabilities(a)       127,519             128,347\nTotal accounts payable and other     $  280,672          $  290,307\nliabilities\n(a) Includes credit card rewards liability of $ 14.4billion and $ 13.2billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe credit card rewards liability represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be\nredeemed by cardholders.

The interest rates shown\nexclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.\n(g) As of December 31, 2024, long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 297.1billion was redeemable at the option of\nJPMorganChase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.\n(h) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2024 is $\n41.0billion in 2025, $ 64.5billion in 2026, $ 32.7billion in 2027, $ 93.4billion in 2028 and $ 26.9billion in 2029.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    289\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for\nat fair value were 3.82% and 3.65% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to modify exposure to\ninterest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorganChase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily\ninterest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of\nthese instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average\ninterest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.15% and\n5.20% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of\nits subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness.

Under the two-class method, all earnings\n(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorganChase grants\nRSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive\nnonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s\ncommon stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights\nto receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS.\nParticipating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for\nadditional information. Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including\nawards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is\ncalculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each\nof the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of net\nincome applicable to common stockholders and basic and\ndiluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions,\nexcept per share amounts)                             2024              2023              2022\nBasic earnings per share\nNet income                                $   58,471        $   49,552        $   37,676\nLess: Preferred stock dividends                1,259             1,501             1,595\nNet income applicable to common equity        57,212            48,051            36,081\nLess: Dividends and undistributed\nearnings allocated to participating              344               291               189\nsecurities\nNet income applicable to common           $   56,868        $   47,760        $   35,892\nstockholders\nTotal weighted-average basic shares          2,873.9           2,938.6           2,965.8\noutstanding\nNet income per share                      $    19.79        $    16.25        $    12.10\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet income applicable to common           $   56,868        $   47,760        $   35,892\nstockholders\nTotal weighted-average basic shares          2,873.9           2,938.6           2,965.8\noutstanding\nAdd:\nDilutive impact of unvested PSUs,                5.1               4.5               4.2\nnondividend-earning RSUs and SARs\nTotal weighted-average diluted shares        2,879.0           2,943.1           2,970.0\noutstanding\nNet income per share                      $    19.75        $    16.23        $    12.09\n294    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNote 24 – Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\nAOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), fair value changes of excluded components on\nfair value hedges, cash flow hedging activities, net gain/(loss) related to the Firm’s defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans, and fair value option-elected liabilities arising from changes in the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA).\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…                                                                                  D…\n…                                                                  D…              on\n…    U…                   T…                                       b…              f…\n…    g…                   a…                Fa…                    p…              v…              A…\n…    on                   n…                va…    C…              a…              o…              o…\n…    i…                   of                he…    f…              O…              e…              c…\n…    s…       2…          h…       (…       (1…    h…       (2…    p…       (2…    l…       (1…    i…       (8…\n…             -…                   -…        98             -5…             -1…             1,…             -1…\n…\n…\n…\n…          $  -…    -a          $  -…    $  -33          $  -5…          $  -1…          $  468          $  -1…\n…\n…\n…             5…                   3…       -1…             1,…             373             -8…             6,…\n…\n…\n…\n…          $  -…    -a          $  -…    $  -1…          $  -3…          $  -1…          $  -3…          $  -1…\n…\n…\n…             -…                   -…       -87             -8…             -63             -36             -2…\n…\n…\n…\n…          $  -…    -a          $  -…    $  -2…          $  -4…          $  -1…          $  -3…          $  -1…\n…\n…\n(a) Included after-tax net unamortized unrealized gains/(losses) of $( 651) million, $( 895) million, and $( 1.3)\nbillion for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to AFS securities that have been transferred\nto HTM.

This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future\ntax consequences of temporary differences between the\ncarrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and\ntax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or\nliability for each temporary difference is determined\nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in\neffect when the underlying items of income and expense\nare realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for income taxes\nincludes the current and deferred portions of that\nexpense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities\narising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being taxed in a\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions, significant\njudgments and estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between JPMorganChase and\nthe many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax\nreturns may not be finalized for several years.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits are certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These unrecognized\nitems include the tax effect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state and local\nunrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the\nbenefit from associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.\nunrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in\nother jurisdictions. JPMorganChase evaluates the need\nfor changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its\nanticipated tax return filing positions as part of its\nU.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In\naddition, the Firm is presently under audit by a\nnumber of taxing authorities, most notably by the\nInternal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax\nexamination status table below. The evaluation of\nunrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for\naudit settlements make it reasonably possible that\nover the next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by\nas much as approximately $ 2.4billion.

(“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the\nloans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company\nor to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred\nto as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are\ngenerally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital\nguidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates\nis limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC\ngenerally holds the stock of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent\nCompany is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal\nsources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and\nextensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit\nor to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and\nits subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking\norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain\ncapital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s\nmanagement or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2025, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the\naggregate, approximately $ 15.5billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior\napproval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2025 will be supplemented by the\nbanking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    299\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 27 – Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding\ncompanies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the rules currently in effect, two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”),\nand an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The three components of regulatory capital\nunder the Basel III rules and their primary drivers are as illustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and\nleverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for\nCET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum\nrequirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-\nrelated commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13\nfor further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following\ntable summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total\navailable credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available\nlines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these\ncommitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has\nbeen a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of\nunderlying property.\n302    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nO…\ns…\nl…\nf…\ni…\ng…\na…\no…\nc…\nBy\nr…\nm…\nas\nof\nD…       Co…\n3…       am…\n(…       20…         Ex…         Ex…\nm…       Ex…         af…         af…\nL…        in           1           3\nC…         1         ye…         ye…         Ex…\ne…       ye…         th…         th…         af…                                     Ca…\nc…        or           3           5           5                       20…           va…\nc…       le…         ye…         ye…         ye…         To…           To…           20…             2023\nR…\nR…    $  10…      $  7,…      $  4,…      $  7,…      $  30…        $  30…        $  534    -j    $   678    -j\nE…\nA…\na…       10…          14           5         3,…         14…           15…            37    -j        148    -j\no…\nT…\nc…\ne…       21…         7,…         4,…         11…         44…           45…           571              826\nc…\nc…\nC…       1,…           —           —           —         1,…           91…             —                —\nc…\nT…       1,…         7,…         4,…         11…         1,…           96…           571              826\nc…\nW…\nO…\nu…\nc…       10…         19…         17…         24…         49…           50…           2,…    -j       2,7…    -j\nto\ne…\nc…\nS…\nl…\nof\nc…       15…         8,…         3,…         565         28…           28…           473              479\na…\no…\nf…\ng…\nO…\nl…       3,…         278          21          97         4,…           4,…            37               37\nof\nc…\nT…       12…         20…         17…         25…         53…           53…           3,…             3,3…\nw…\nT…    $  1,…      $  21…      $  18…      $  36…      $  1,…        $  1,…        $  3,…          $  4,1…\nl…\nO…\ng…\na…\nc…\nS…\nl…\ni…    $  31…      $    —      $    —      $    —      $  31…        $  28…        $    —          $     —\na…\na…\ng…\nD…\nq…       902         343         9,…         38…         49…           54…           113               89\nas\ng…\nU…\nr…\na…       11…           —           —           —         11…           95…             2                —\ns…\nb…\na…\nU…\nr…\na…       66…           —           —           —         66…           60…            -2                —\ns…\nl…\na…\nL…\ns…\na…\ns…\ni…\nM…\nr…            NA          NA          NA          NA          NA            NA        45               76\nl…\nL…\ns…            NA          NA          NA          NA     1,…           803            23               24\nw…\nr…\nE…\n&\nc…\nh…       40…           —           —           —         40…           26…             —                —\ng…\na…\nc…\nO…\ng…       10…         425         435         884         12…           15…            28               38\na…\nc…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $\n85million and $ 88million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 9.5billion and $\n8.2billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $ 556million and $\n589million, respectively, for other letters of credit.

Refer to Note 34 for additional\ninformation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    303\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of\ncommitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper\nfacilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well\nas committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount\nequal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a\ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform\nunder a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and\nthe guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of\nconsideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records\nthis fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation\nis recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any\nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds\nis allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For\nthese indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time\nor when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications\nare included in the table on page 303. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2024                                              2023\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of\ncredit and                                        credit and\nDecember 31,    other                                             other                                   Other\n(in             financial                        Other letters    financial                             letters\nmillions)       guarantees                           of credit    guarantees                          of credit\nInvestment-…                     $  20,443    $          3,380                     $  19,694    $         3,552\nNoninvestme…                         8,233                 974                         9,178                836\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  28,676    $          4,354                     $  28,872    $         4,388\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $      94    $             37                     $     110    $            37\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              379                   —                           369                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     473    $             37                     $     479    $            37\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  16,805    $            357                     $  16,861    $           539\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\n304    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s\nsecurities lending program, counterparties’\nsecurities, via custodial and non-custodial\narrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of\nthis program, the Firm provides an indemnification in\nthe lending agreements which protects the lender\nagainst the failure of the borrower to return the lent\nsecurities. To minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or\nother highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan\nfrom the borrower. Collateral is marked to market\ndaily to help assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is called from the\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit the\nlending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal\ninvested. To minimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market\nvalue exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nThese contracts include written put options that\nrequire the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by\nthe option holder at a specified price by a specified\ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written\nput option contracts in order to meet client needs, or\nfor other trading purposes. The terms of written put\noptions are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives\ndeemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as “stable value\nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of\nthe difference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been met.\nStable value products are transacted in order to allow\ninvestors to realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected portfolio. These\ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to\nterminate the contract under certain conditions. The\nnotional value of derivative guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However,\nexposure to certain stable value products is\ncontractually limited to a substantially lower\npercentage of the notional amount.\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the\nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm\nwill be required to perform under the contract. The\nFirm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering\ninto offsetting transactions, or by entering into\ncontracts that hedge the market risk related to the\nderivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\n(in millions)                                      December 31, 2024               December 31, 2023\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  49,628                       $  54,562\nStable value contracts with                32,939                          32,488\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        1,740                           1,652\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                           113                              89\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal course\nof business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty.\nThe Firm also enters into repurchase and securities\nloaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the counterparty. Such\nagreements settle at a future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets until settlement date. These agreements\npredominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer\nto Note 11 for a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-\nrelated indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has\nmade representations and warranties that the loans\nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require\nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify\nthe loan purchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    305\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nPrivate label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and\ncertain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the\nprincipal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing\nadvances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans,\nsuch as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing\npredominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the\nsum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing\nof the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the\ntrust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related\nliability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets,\nwhich is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse\nobligations, are disclosed in the table on page 303. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification\nagreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay\nadditional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of\nwithholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the\nright to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification\nclauses such as in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a\nbusiness or assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees\nfor claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party\npurchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets.\nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would\nrequire an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have\nnot yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant\nServices business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card\ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the\nFirm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge\nback the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding\nfuture settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes\na valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. Clearing Services –\nClient Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales\nand derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and\nsecurities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the\nrelevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis\nbased on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative\ncontract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As\na clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients\nfor the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the\ncollection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can\nalso cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement.\nIn the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available\nmargin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to\nbe paid by the Firm as a clearing member.\n306    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables\nfrom clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not\nreflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible\nexposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients\nmay execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to\nthe Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these\narrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that\nthe Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Exchange & Clearing\nHouse Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in\nthe U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these\norganizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of\nthe default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited\nto the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a\nclearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default.\nAlternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the\nguarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of\nlosses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin,\nunrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should\nsuch losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the\nlosses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure\nunder these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against\nthe Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss\nto the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in\nthe table on page 303, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients\nthat become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full\npayment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm\nminimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss\nto be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer to Note 11 for\nadditional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged\nunder repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may\nprovide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a\ncontract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are\nincluded on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore,\nthe Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the\noccurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The\nParent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan\nChase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully\nand unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these\nsecurities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are\nnot included in the table on page 303 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    307\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that\nit owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at\ndiscount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various\nother central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the\nFirm’s pledged assets.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                              2024                2023\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $    152.5          $    145.0\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged         297.9               244.2\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks          724.0               675.6\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  1,174.4          $  1,064.8\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities.

The litigations range from individual actions\ninvolving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations\nand regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and\nself-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of\nclaims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.4billion at December 31, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was\nbased upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate\nof reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can\nbe made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves\nsignificant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that\nmany are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the\nFirm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of\nthe proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions\nconcerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties\nor regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a\ndefendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian\nstate-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)\nSA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB\nand paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company\nbetween 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the\nvalidity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by\n1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a\nnew claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to\nhear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions\narising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons\nfor the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement\nDirectorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010\nand 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects\ndeveloped by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential\nunits. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,\nand the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making\npreliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore\nfunds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the\ninquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain\ngovernment authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to\nthose activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    309\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\naffiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only\nremaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently\npending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related\nindividual and putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands,\nBrazil and Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's\nearlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision\nto the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action,\nwhich remains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed\na series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set\nthe price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively\ncontributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action\nseeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval\nof a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their\nrespective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are\nconsidering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who\nopted out representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s\n(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro\nInterbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which\nthe Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European\nCommission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to\nEURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but\nexercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of\nthis decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant\nalong with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S.\ndollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of antitrust claims\nrelated to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained\ndismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for\nsummary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims,\nalleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and\nconspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023\nand affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December 2024. The Firm has\nresolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with international\nsanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with\nindividuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and\nthreatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from\npaying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other\nfinancial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum\nselection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have\nentered judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has been\nexecuted against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total\namount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian courts'\ndecisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered interim freezes of\nFirm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized\ncapital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination of\n310    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\ncertain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts and\nrelated freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further\nclaims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper\napplication of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could also be\nseized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries . In October 2024, the\nFirm entered into settlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, among other things, conflict\ndisclosures concerning the selection of portfolio managers and the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares\ndistributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds and certain\nother matters. The resolutions required the Firm to pay a combined $ 151million in civil penalties and voluntary\npayments to customers. The Firm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC inquiries concerning the aggregation\nof accounts for fee billing and various other matters. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class\nactions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against\nthe Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits\nrelate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and\nrelated conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and\nfiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC\nin November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York\nin May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading\npractices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above.\nIn December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the\nplaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action relating to the historical\ntrading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. Zelle Network Litigation . In December 2024,\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”),\nBank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District Court for\nthe District of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that EWS and the defendant banks have failed to take sufficient efforts\nto prevent fraud on the Zelle network. The defendants will file a response to the complaint. * * * In addition to\nthe various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are\notherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has\nestablished reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the\nprovisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable\nthat such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates\nits outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such\nreserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel.\nThe Firm’s legal expense was $ 740million, $ 1.4billion and $ 266million for the years ended December 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories,\ninvolve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what\nwill be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its\ncurrent knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described\nabove and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible\nlosses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on\nthe Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved\nin such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly\nexceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As\na result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular\nperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of\nJPMorganChase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    311\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 31 – International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase by major\ninternational geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation\nas business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is\nbased predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed,\nbooking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve\ninternational businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have\nbeen made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and\nassumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The\nFirm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation\nto total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for\nthe year\nended\nDecember 31,                                            Income before\n(in millions)                                              income tax\n2024                Revenue(b)       Expense(c)               expense       Net income       Total assets\nEurope/Middle    $      22,353    $      12,843    $            9,510    $       6,713    $       552,407    -d\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific            11,995            6,922                 5,073            3,615            296,430\nLatin                    3,885            1,895                 1,990            1,512             73,631\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   38,233           21,660                16,573           11,840            922,468\ninternational\nNorth                  139,323           80,815                58,508           46,631          3,080,346\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     177,556    $     102,475    $           75,081    $      58,471    $     4,002,814\n2023\nEurope/Middle    $      20,974    $      11,947    $            9,027    $       6,402    $       529,335    -d\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific            10,605            6,550                 4,055            2,709            251,588\nLatin                    3,294            1,971                 1,323              994             83,003\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   34,873           20,468                14,405           10,105            863,926\ninternational\nNorth                  123,231           76,024                47,207           39,447          3,011,467\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     158,104    $      96,492    $           61,612    $      49,552    $     3,875,393\n2022\nEurope/Middle    $      18,765    $      11,754    $            7,011    $       5,158    $       558,430    -d\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific            10,025            6,763                 3,262            2,119            281,479\nLatin                    3,178            1,697                 1,481            1,156             78,673\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   31,968           20,214                11,754            8,433            918,582\ninternational\nNorth                   96,727           62,315                34,412           29,243          2,747,161\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     128,695    $      82,529    $           46,166    $      37,676    $     3,665,743\n(a) Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b) Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.\n(c) Expense is composed of noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.\n(d) Total assets for the U.K. were approximately $ 369billion, $ 352billion and $ 357billion at December 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n312    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNote 32 – Business segments & Corporate\nBusiness segment reorganization: Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable\nbusiness segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to\nform one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the reorganization, the Firm has\nthree reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth\nManagement – with the remaining activities in Corporate. Adoption of accounting standard — Segment Reporting —\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures: This guidance was adopted retrospectively for the Firm’s annual\nConsolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of this guidance requires\nadditional reportable segment disclosures, primarily relating to significant segment expenses and the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”). Adoption of this guidance did not result in changes to the identification of the\nFirm’s reportable business segments, or of its CODM. The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. The business segments are\ndetermined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner\nin which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as\nthe Firm’s CODM. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment & Corporate results in this\nfootnote for a further discussion of JPMorganChase’s reportable business segments and Corporate. The following is a\ndescription of each of the Firm’s reportable business segments, and the products and services that they provide to\ntheir respective client bases, as well as a description of Corporate activities. Consumer & Community Banking\nConsumer & Community Banking offers products and services to consumers and small businesses through bank branches,\nATMs, digital (including mobile and online) and telephone banking.

The majority of AWM’s\nclient assets are in actively managed portfolios. Corporate Corporate consists of Treasury and Chief Investment\nOffice (“CIO”) and Other Corporate. Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring,\nreporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\nOther Corporate includes staff functions and expense that is centrally managed as well as certain Firm initiatives\nand activities not solely aligned to a specific LOB. The major Other Corporate functions include Real Estate,\nTechnology, Legal, Corporate Finance, Human Resources, Internal Audit, Risk Management, Compliance, Control\nManagement, Corporate Responsibility and various Other Corporate groups.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    313\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business\nsegment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the\nassumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further\nrefinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB\non at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm\nand its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses\nwithin each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the\nparticipating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or businesses\ninvolved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Expense\nallocation Where business segments use services provided by Corporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated\nbased on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to\nCorporate that are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were\nstand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular reportable business segment. Funds\ntransfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury\nand CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of\nnet interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect\nto consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest\nincome that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. Foreign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and\nexpenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements\nrelated to the transferred risk in its results. Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the\nFTP process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and\npreferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is\nretained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs\nof the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net\ninterest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a business segment’s net\nincome applicable to common equity. Capital allocation Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking into\nconsideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of\nan LOB’s performance. The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and\nthe GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe\nstress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change.\n314    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nSegment & Corporate results\nThe following table provides a summary of results for the Firm’s reportable business segments and Corporate\nactivities as of or for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition\nof managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total\nnet revenue for the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the\nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the\ncomparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding\nincome tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

The acquisition\nresulted in a bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets\nacquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination\nunder U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally\nmeasured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required\nmanagement to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other\nvaluation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain.\nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The final\nbargain purchase gain of $ 2.9billion reflects adjustments of $ 103million and $ 63million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, made during the one-year measurement period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP,\nto finalize management's fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31,\n2024, certain matters related to the final settlement remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. On\nJanuary 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding items. As a\nresult of the agreement, the Firm made a payment of $ 609million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its\nadditional payable to the FDIC, which will result in a gain of approximately $ 600million to be recorded in other\nincome in the first quarter of 2025. In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC\nentered into twoshared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the \"shared-\nloss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”).\nThe CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery period\nfor certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a\npari passu basis, for 7years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in\ncooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the fair value\nof the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of the\nconsideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money\nNote\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired\nloans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion deposit\nwith First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large\nU.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated\nallowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $ 25billion of\ndeposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    319\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe computation of the purchase price, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of\nthe First Republic acquisition and the related bargain purchase gain are presented below, which reflects\nadjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.

The core deposit intangible of $ 1.3billion\nwas valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the\nfavorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the\ncost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available\nto market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated\nafter-tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible\nasset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair\nvalues, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the\nrelationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles are amortized over a\nprojected period of future cash flows of approximately 7years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other\nintangible assets.\n320    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the\nFDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The indemnification\nassets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The\nfair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying\nthe related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is\nbased on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with\nthe shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to\nmake a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and\nrecoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent\nconsideration as part of the purchase price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money\nNote is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note\nwas estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The\nFHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair\nvalues of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB\nadvance issuance rates.\nLoans\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and fair values of the loans acquired as of May\n1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the\nloans acquired .\nMay 1, 2023\n(in millions)                         UPB       Fair value\nResidential real estate    $      106,240    $      92,053\nAuto and other                      3,093            2,030\nTotal consumer                    109,333           94,083\nSecured by real estate             37,117           33,602\nCommercial & industrial             4,332            3,932\nOther                              23,499           21,625\nTotal wholesale                    64,948           59,159\nTotal loans                $      174,281    $     153,242\nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the\nestimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2billion .

presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between\nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in\nthe table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more information on average balances and\nrates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated\nseparately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net\nspread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result,\nchanges in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result,\nand due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended               2024 versus\nDecember 31,                    2023                                 2023 versus 2022\n(On a                Increase/(decr…                                 Increase/(decre…\ntaxable-equiv…         due to change                                    due to change\nbasis;

A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans\nare subject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting\nspecified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good\ncredit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

Loans (other than\ncredit card loans and certain consumer loans insured\nby U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus when full payment of principal and interest is\nnot expected, regardless of delinquency status, or\nwhen principal and interest have been in default for a\nperiod\nof 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-\nsecured and in the process of collection. Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual\nstatus.\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other commercial\nand personal property.\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\nOAS: Option-adjusted spread\nOCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nOCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)\nOPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit\nOperating losses: Primarily refer to fraud losses\nassociated with customer deposit accounts, credit and\ndebit cards; exclude legal expense.\nOver-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\nOver-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives:\nDerivative contracts that are negotiated and executed\nbilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central\nclearing house, such that each derivative counterparty\nis only exposed to the default of that clearing house.\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of\ntotal net revenue.\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nParticipating securities: Represents unvested share-\nbased compensation awards containing nonforfeitable\nrights to dividends or dividend equivalents\n(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the\nearnings per share calculation using the two-class\nmethod. JPMorganChase grants RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common\nstock. These unvested awards meet the definition of\nparticipating securities. Under the two-class method,\nall earnings (distributed and undistributed) are\nallocated to each class of common stock and\nparticipating securities, based on their respective\nrights to receive dividends.\nPCAOB: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\nPCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent\nacquired financial assets that as of the date of\nacquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since origination, as\ndetermined by the Firm.\nPD: Probability of default\nPillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three\n“Pillar” approach.

The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing the\nability of a lending institution to generate income in\nexcess of its provision for credit losses.\nPre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax\nexpense divided by total net revenue, which is, in\nmanagement’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax\nperformance derived by measuring earnings after all\ncosts are taken into consideration. It is one basis\nupon which management evaluates the performance of AWM\nagainst the performance of their respective\ncompetitors.\nPrincipal transactions revenue: Principal transactions\nrevenue is driven by many factors, including:\nthe bid-offer spread, which is the difference\nbetween the price at which a market participant is\nwilling and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and\nthe price at which another market participant is\nwilling and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice\nversa; and\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses on\nfinancial instruments and commodities transactions,\nincluding those accounted for under the fair value\noption, primarily used in client-driven market-making\nactivities.\n– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of\ninstruments, closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments.\n– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in\nvaluation.\nIn connection with its client-driven market-making\nactivities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity\ninstruments, derivatives and commodities, including\nphysical commodities inventories and financial\ninstruments that reference commodities.\nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized\nand unrealized gains and losses related to:\nderivatives designated in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges\nof commodity and foreign exchange risk;\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign\nexchange and interest rate risks.\nProduction revenue: Includes fees and income\nrecognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with\nthe intent to sell, and the impact of risk management\nactivities associated with the mortgage pipeline and\nwarehouse loans. Production revenue also includes\ngains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair\nvalue adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies), and changes in the fair value of\nfinancial instruments measured under the fair value\noption.\nPSU(s): Performance share units\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\nREO: Real estate owned\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\nRetained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e., excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue).\nRevenue wallet: Proportion of fee revenue based on\nestimates of investment banking fees generated across\nthe industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from\ninvestment banking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the calculation\nof credit risk RWA between the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,\ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches\nwhich largely rely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on\nsupervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is\ncalculated on a generally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.\nS&P: Standard and Poor’s\nSAR as it pertains to Hong Kong: Special\nAdministrative Region\n332    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nGlossary of Terms and Acronyms\nSAR(s) as it pertains to employee stock awards: Stock\nappreciation rights\nSCB: Stress capital buffer\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that\npredominantly include residential real estate loans,\ncredit card loans, auto loans to individuals and\ncertain small business loans.\nSEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nSecurities financing agreements: Include resale,\nrepurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned\nagreements\nSecuritized Products Group: Comprised of Securitized\nProducts and tax-oriented investments.\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in\nproducts, such as mutual funds, with the intention of\nensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a\nviable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its\nshares, and allowing the manager to develop a track\nrecord.

          "content": "Part I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well\nas the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a\nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding\ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject\nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The\nFederal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the\nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of\nJPMorganChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated\ndirectly by additional authorities based on the\nactivities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorganChase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and,\nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorganChase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and\nregulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the Firm that\nengage in certain futures-related and swaps-related\nactivities are supervised and regulated by the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc holds a banking license in the\nU.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential\nRegulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution jointly\nregulated by the European Central Bank (“ECB”), the\nGerman Financial Supervisory Authority and the German\nCentral Bank, as well as the local regulators in each\nof the countries in which it operates. The Firm’s\nother non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the\nbanking, securities, prudential, payments and conduct\nregulatory authorities, as applicable, in the\ncountries in which they operate.\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business\nactivities other than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted\nto engage in a broader range of financial activities.\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nactivities if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also\nimpose corrective capital and/or managerial\nrequirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are\npersistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s\ndepository institutions. If any\ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails to\nmaintain a satisfactory rating under the Community\nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit\nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new\nactivities other than those permissible for BHCs, or\nacquiring a company engaged in such activities.\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorganChase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries\nand branches are also subject to local capital and\nliquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators\nreleased a proposal to amend the U.S. risk-based\ncapital framework to incorporate certain elements of\nthe revised international Basel III capital framework.\nThe proposal would significantly revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S.\nglobal systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\").\nFinalization of the proposal, including the required\nimplementation date, is uncertain. The Firm continues\nto monitor developments and potential impacts.\nIn the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized the\nrules implementing their Basel III frameworks. The new\nrules became effective in the EU beginning January 1,\n2025, with market risk aspects delayed until January\n1, 2026. In January 2025, the PRA announced that it\nintends to delay the implementation of the new rules\nin the U.K. to January 1, 2027. There are certain\ntransitional arrangements applicable in both the EU\nand U.K. until 2032 and 2030, respectively.\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an\nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking\ninto account the results of separate stress tests\ndesigned by each of the Firm and the Federal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve uses the results under the\nseverely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress\ntest to determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer\n(“SCB”) requirement for the coming year, which forms\npart of the Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The\nFirm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on\nApril 5, 2025. The Federal Reserve will notify the\nFirm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30,\n2025 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2025. The\nFirm’s final\n2\nSCB requirement will become effective on October 1,\n2025. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to\nperform separate, similar stress tests annually. The\nFirm publishes each year the results of the annual\nstress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse”\nscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nIn December 2024, the Federal Reserve indicated in a\npress release that it intends to seek public comment\non changes to its stress testing framework.\nAdditionally, there is a pending legal challenge to\nthe manner in which stress testing is administered.\nRefer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on pages\n6-7 for further information.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for more\ninformation.\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate\nto identify and monitor risks to the financial\nstability of the U.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and\nreporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial institutions\n(“SIFIs”), such as JPMorganChase. The Federal Reserve\nhas adopted several rules to implement those\nheightened prudential standards, including rules\nrelating to risk management and corporate governance\nof subject BHCs. JPMorganChase is required under these\nrules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall\nrisk management standards, including oversight by the\nboard of directors of risk management activities.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the\nFederal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and\ntheir banks are subject to requirements, limitations\nand prohibitions established by law and by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are\nrequired to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares\nof an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by\nfinancial companies are generally prohibited if, as a\nresult of the acquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies, as determined\nunder Federal Reserve regulations. Furthermore, for\ncertain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written\nnotice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring\ndirect or indirect ownership or control of any voting\nshares of any company with over $10 billion in assets\nthat is engaged in activities that are “financial in\nnature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a\nbroader range of activities (including acquisitions)\nthan BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to\nlimit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise\npermissible acquisitions if the FHC or any of its\ndepository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet\napplicable eligibility requirements.\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to a five-\nyear cooperation obligation under an order issued by\nthe CFTC on September 29, 2020, relating to precious\nmetals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations. The\nFirm also remains subject to consent orders entered\ninto in March 2024 with the OCC and the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and a\nresolution entered into in May 2024 with the CFTC,\nwhich relate to the Firm’s processes to inventory\ntrading venues and confirm the completeness of certain\ndata fed to trade surveillance platforms.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those\nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could include limiting\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities, or imposing\ncorrective capital or managerial requirements on the\nbank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on banks, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC is required to\nmaintain a minimum reserve ratio, which measures the\nbalance of reserves in the deposit insurance fund\nagainst an estimate of FDIC-insured deposits, of\n1.35%. The reserve ratio is currently below the\nstatutory minimum and, in October 2022, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule to raise bank assessments and\naccelerate the time by which the reserve ratio would\nmeet the statutory minimum. As a result, the FDIC has\nadopted a restoration plan to bring the reserve ratio\nup to the required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a\nlonger-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio of\n2%.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad\npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the\napproval of the institution’s creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to a depository\ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain\n3",

The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the\nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the\nundercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In\ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration\nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nHeightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the OCC\nhas established guidelines setting forth heightened\nstandards for large banks, including minimum standards\nfor the design and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s\nrisk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s\nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from\nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.\nThe bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for\napproving the bank’s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking\nactivities, and holding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance framework.\nThe Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. are\nsubject to supervisory expectations published by the\nECB and the PRA, respectively, addressing bank\nstrategy, governance and risk management in the areas\nof climate change, operational resilience, reliance on\nIT systems and third-party services, and resilience\nfrom macro-financial and geopolitical shocks.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of\ncredit to, investments in stock or securities of, and\nderivatives, securities lending and certain other\ntransactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain\nother affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries unless\nthe loans are secured in specified amounts and comply\nwith certain other requirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations\non the payment of dividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the\namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\ncould pay, at January 1, 2025, to JPMorganChase\nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The\nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank\nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of\nthe financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of\na receiver of an insured depositary institution\n(“IDI”) for administrative expense and the claims of\nholders of\nU.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and\ndeposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable\nin the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority\nover the claims of other unsecured creditors of the\ninstitution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches\nand public noteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorganChase and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision\nand regulation in the U.S. by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal\nconsumer protection laws, including laws relating to\nfair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices in connection with the\noffer, sale or provision of consumer financial\nproducts and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction\nover small business lending activities with respect to\nfair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As\npart of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions against firms\nthat offer certain products and services to consumers\nusing practices that are deemed to be unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive. In March 2024, the CFPB released\na final rule which significantly reduces the late\npayment fees that large credit card issuers, including\nthe Firm, are permitted to charge to customers (the\n“CFPB Late Fee Rule”). The final rule is currently\nstayed pending resolution of an industry-led challenge\nin federal court. Refer to Litigation and regulatory\nchallenges on pages 6-7 for further information.\nIn addition, in October 2024, the CFPB issued a final\nrule that requires data providers, including banks, to\nmake certain consumer data available to consumers and\nauthorized third parties in electronic form beginning\nin April 2026 (the “CFPB Data Sharing Rule”). Refer to\nLitigation and regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for\nfurther information.\nSeparately, in December 2024, the CFPB announced a\nfinal rule that would significantly restrict overdraft\nfees for certain insured depository institutions,\nincluding the Firm (the “CFPB Overdraft Rule”). The\nrule imposes certain requirements on overdraft\nprotections that are similar to those that apply to\ncredit cards, unless the institution prices the\noverdraft fee at $5 per transaction or the\ninstitution’s cost as outlined by the CFPB . Refer to\nLitigation and regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for\nfurther information.\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed to\nlower the maximum interchange fee that large debit\ncard issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted\nto receive for a debit card transaction. The proposal\nwould also establish a process for automatically\npublishing an updated maximum fee amount every other\nyear going forward. The Firm’s consumer activities are\nalso subject to regulation under state\n4\nstatutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or\nempowered agency of each state.\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through\nJ.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides\nretail investment management services through Nutmeg\nSaving and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is\nregulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are\nregulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of\nfinancial services in the U.K., including obligations\nrelating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is\nalso regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator\nwith respect to its operation and use of payment\nsystems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL\nand Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection\nlegislation.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and\nbrokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations\nof the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange,\namong others. The Firm conducts similar securities\nactivities outside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities\nare primarily conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc\nand in the EU, those activities are primarily\nconducted by JPMSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws\nand regulations covering all aspects of the securities\nbusiness, including sales and trading practices,\nsecurities offerings, publication of research reports,\nuse of customer funds, the financing of client\npurchases, capital structure, record-keeping and\nretention, and the conduct of their directors,\nofficers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer\nregulatory capital on page 107 for information\nconcerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,\nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc and JPMSE. In addition, the\nFirm's sales and trading activities, which are\nconducted through both bank and non-bank subsidiaries,\nare subject to laws and regulations relating to market\nconduct, including prohibitions on manipulative or\nanti-competitive practices.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are\nsubject to significant regulation in jurisdictions\naround the world relating to, among other things, the\nsafeguarding and management of client assets,\nofferings of funds and marketing activities. Certain\nof the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and\nsubject to oversight by, the SEC as investment\nadvisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered\ninvestment advisers in the U.S. are subject to the\nfiduciary and other obligations imposed under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state\nand federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities\nare subject to supervision by the OCC.\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses\ncontinue to be subject to ongoing rule-making and\nimplementation of new regulations and other guidance,\nincluding by the SEC and certain U.S. states with\nrespect to enhanced standards of conduct and conflicts\nof interest. In April 2024, the Department of Labor\n(“DOL”) finalized a new “fiduciary” rule that would\nsignificantly expand the scope for defining who can be\ndeemed investment advice fiduciaries for purposes of\nretirement plans and individual retirement accounts\n(“IRAs”) under the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as amended (the “Fiduciary Rule”). Among\nthe most significant impacts of the rule and related\namendments to prohibited transaction exemptions would\nbe the impact on the fee and compensation practices at\nfinancial institutions that offer investment\nrecommendations to retirement clients, including in\nthe context of rollovers from an employer plan to an\nIRA. The effective date of the Fiduciary Rule has been\nstayed by two federal courts. Refer to Litigation and\nregulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further\ninformation.\nDerivatives regulation:\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its\nderivatives businesses. In the U.S., JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap\ndealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC\nas “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these\nentities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory\nframework applicable to their swap or security-based\nswap activities, including capital requirements, rules\nrequiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and\nsecurity-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of\ncounterparty collateral, business conduct and\ndocumentation standards, rules requiring the central\nclearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives, requirements that certain standardized\nOTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues,\nrecord-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-\nfraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar\nrequirements have also been established in the\nEuropean Union (“EU”) under the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as well\nas in the U.K. and other jurisdictions around the\nworld.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the\nCFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member\nof the National Futures Association.\nData, privacy, cybersecurity and artificial\nintelligence regulation:\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws,\nrules and regulations globally concerning data,\nincluding data protection, consumer protection,\nprivacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and\nrelated\n5",

These laws, rules and regulations are\nconstantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain\na focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by\nprivate parties or government bodies, and continue to\nhave a significant impact on all of the Firm’s\nbusinesses and operations.\nFor example, the Digital Operational Resilience Act\n(DORA) mandates that the Firm’s financial services\nsubsidiaries operating in the EU comply with\nrequirements relating to information and\ncommunications technology (“ICT”) risk management,\nreporting, security control testing and ICT third\nparty risks beginning in January 2025. In addition,\nthe EU Artificial Intelligence Act regulates the\ndevelopment and deployment of artificial intelligence\nsystems within the EU, with phased-in requirements\nthat began in February 2025.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal\ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA\nincludes a variety of record-keeping and reporting\nrequirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-\ncustomer documentation requirements. The Firm is also\nsubject to the regulations and economic sanctions\nprograms administered and enforced by the U.S.\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)\nand EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in countries that\nare, involved in activities including terrorism,\nhostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.\nThe Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws,\nrules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which\nit operates, including those that conflict with or\nprohibit a firm such as JPMorganChase from complying\nwith certain laws, rules and regulations to which it\nis otherwise subject.\nAnti-Corruption:\nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices:\nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to\noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other\nagencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued\nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to\nensure that incentive compensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking\nthat threatens the organizations’ safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has\nalso established standards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm’s compensation\npractices are also subject to regulation and oversight\nby regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the\nFifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as\nimplemented in the EU and as largely adopted in the\nU.K, which includes compensation-related provisions.\nThe European Banking Authority has instituted\nguidelines on compensation policies including under\nCRD V which in certain countries (such as Germany) are\nimplemented or supplemented by local regulations or\nguidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted\nregulations and guidelines on compensation policies,\nwhich diverge in certain areas from EU rules. The Firm\nexpects that the implementation of regulatory\nguidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and\nother countries will continue to evolve, and may\naffect the manner in which the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\nSustainability:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and the EU have continued to\nimplement and enhance sustainability-related\ninitiatives and disclosure requirements. The Corporate\nSustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will\nreplace and significantly expand the scope and content\nof certain EU ESG reporting requirements, with phased-\nin requirements expected to start with fiscal year\n2024. The implementation of CSRD into local law has\nbeen delayed in a number of member states, including\nin Germany, and the Firm continues to monitor\ndevelopments and potential impacts. In addition, in\nJuly 2024, the EU enacted the Corporate Sustainability\nDue Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”), which provides for\nphased-in requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD\nsets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies\nto address actual and potential human rights\nviolations and environmental adverse impacts stemming\nfrom their own operations and business relationships,\nincluding the activities of certain companies with\nwhich they have established business relationships and\nalso requires the adoption of company-specific\nclimate-related transition plans. Both the CSRD and\nCSDDD will impact certain of the Firm’s EU and non-EU\nentities.\nLitigation and regulatory challenges:\nTrade organizations representing the financial\nservices industry and others have filed lawsuits\nchallenging various laws, rules and regulations that,\nif enacted, adopted or implemented, could have\nsignificant adverse impacts on the results of\noperations or compliance costs of financial\ninstitutions, including the Firm. These matters\ninclude:\nStress tests: The Bank Policy Institute (“BPI”), the\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and other trade organizations\nfiled an action against the Federal Reserve in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District\nof Ohio in December 2024 challenging the manner in\nwhich the annual stress testing process is\nadministered.\n6\nCFPB Late Fee Rule : This rule has been stayed\npending resolution of an action challenging the rule\nfiled against the CFPB in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Texas in March 2024\nby trade organizations including the American Bankers\nAssociation and the Consumer Bankers Association.\nCFPB Data Sharing Rule : The BPI, the Kentucky\nBankers Association and other organizations filed an\naction against the CFPB in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Kentucky in October\n2024 challenging key aspects of this rule.\nCFPB Overdraft Rule : An action filed by trade\norganizations led by the Mississippi Bankers\nAssociation against the CFPB in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nMississippi in December 2024 seeks a preliminary\ninjunction to stay the October 1, 2025 effective date\nof this rule. The CFPB has consented in part to stay\nthe effective date of the rule by 90 days and to\ntemporarily stay the litigation. The preliminary\ninjunction and the stay of litigation are pending\ncourt approval.\nFiduciary Rule : Trade organizations including the\nFederation of Americans for Consumer Choice and the\nAmerican Council of Life Insurers filed actions\nagainst the DOL seeking to enjoin this rule, and in\nJuly 2024, the effective date of the rule was stayed\nby two United States District Courts.\n7",

          "content": "Part I\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services\nregulation and supervision can negatively impact\nJPMorganChase’s businesses, operations and financial\nresults.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms can\nvary according to factors such as the size of the\nfirm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorganChase are often subject\nto more stringent supervision, regulation and\nregulatory scrutiny\nfinancial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation, or may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not have the same\nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies that supervise more diversified financial\nservices firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory and supervisory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction may favor\nfinancial institutions that are based in that\njurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework can result in JPMorganChase\nlosing market share to competitors that are less\nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways\nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are implemented in the\nU.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorganChase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to implement a global\nregulatory or supervisory standard, a national\nregulator may introduce additional or more restrictive\nrequirements, which can create competitive\ndisadvantages for financial services firms, such as\nJPMorganChase, that may be subject to those enhanced\nregulations.\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have\nadopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict\nwith or prohibit JPMorganChase from complying with\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise\nsubject, creating conflict of law issues that also\nincrease its risk of non-compliance in those\njurisdictions.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. have required and could in the future require\nJPMorganChase to make significant modifications to its\noperations and legal entity structure in the relevant\ncountries or regions in order to comply with those\nrequirements. These include laws, rules and\nregulations that have been adopted or proposed, as\nwell as regulatory expectations, relating to:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital\nor liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nthe implementation of processes within locally-based\nsubsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements or expectations\nthe separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking\nproducts and services from markets activities\nrequirements for the orderly resolution of financial\ninstitutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions\non exchanges or through central counterparties\n(“CCPs”), or for depositing funds with other financial\ninstitutions or clearing and settlement systems\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorganChase\nto:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nmaintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, or\nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs\nincur higher operational and compliance costs\nchange the prices that it charges for its products\nand services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to\nits customers and clients\ncurtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\nbecome subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorganChase’s\nability to compete against other firms that are not\nsubject to the same laws, rules and regulations or\nsupervisory oversight, or harm JPMorganChase’s\nbusinesses, results of operations and profitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorganChase to significant penalties and collateral\nconsequences, and could result in higher compliance\ncosts or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorganChase is subject to heightened oversight and\nscrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorganChase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other\n12\npenalties and experienced other repercussions in\nconnection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies.\nJPMorganChase could become subject to similar\nregulatory or governmental resolutions or other\nactions in the future, and addressing the requirements\nof any such resolutions or actions could result in\nJPMorganChase incurring higher operational and\ncompliance costs, including devoting substantial\nresources to the required remediation or needing to\ncomply with other restrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorganChase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to JPMorganChase’s reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, government officials in the U.S. and\nother countries have demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against financial institutions\nand have required that institutions plead guilty to\ncriminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in\nconnection with resolving regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have\nsignificant collateral consequences for the subject\nfinancial institution, including:\nloss of clients, customers and business\nrestrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorganChase expects that:\nit and other financial services firms will continue\nto be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions\ngovernmental authorities will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be penalized for actual or\ndeemed violations of law with formal and punitive\nenforcement actions, including the imposition of\nsignificant monetary and other sanctions, rather than\nresolving these matters through informal supervisory\nactions, and\ngovernmental authorities will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions\nagainst JPMorganChase to the extent that it has\npreviously been subject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\nIf JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of any\nresolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and\nexpectations of its regulators, it could be required\nto, among other things:\nenter into further resolutions of investigations or\nenforcement actions\npay additional regulatory penalties or enter into\njudgments, or\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution\nor civil litigation with respect to the conduct that\ngave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nIn addition, JPMorganChase can be subject to higher\ncosts or requests for additional capital in connection\nwith the resolution of governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions involving newly-acquired\nbusinesses, companies in which JPMorganChase has made\nprincipal investments, parties to joint ventures with\nJPMorganChase, and vendors with which JPMorganChase\ndoes business.\nJPMorganChase’s operations and financial results can\nbe negatively impacted in jurisdictions with less\npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\nJPMorganChase conducts existing and new business in\ncertain countries, states, municipalities, territories\nand other jurisdictions in which the application of\nthe rule of law is inconsistent, extralegal or less\npredictable, including with respect to:\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business or\ntransactions\nconflicting or ambiguous laws, rules, regulations\nand judicial orders, or the inconsistent application\nor interpretation of existing laws, rules, regulations\nand judicial precedents\nactions by or at the direction of government\nofficials or agencies\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of\nintellectual property rights or contractual or other\nobligations\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive\nthe threat of regulatory investigations, civil\nlitigations or criminal prosecutions that are\narbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal\nprinciples in other parts of the world, and\n13",

For example, JPMorganChase has\nfaced actual and threatened litigation in Russia with\nrespect to payments that JPMorganChase cannot make\nunder, and is contractually excused from paying as a\nresult of, relevant economic sanctions laws. That\nlitigation has also resulted in the seizure of assets.\nIn addition, conducting business in jurisdictions with\nless predictable legal and regulatory frameworks could\nrequire JPMorganChase to devote significant additional\nresources to understanding local laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as structuring its operations to\ncomply with local laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementing and administering related internal\npolicies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in compliance\nwith the laws, rules and regulations of all of the\njurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of\nnon-compliance, or of interference with\nJPMorganChase's businesses, can be greater in\njurisdictions that have less predictable legal and\nregulatory frameworks.\nJPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively impacted\nby governmental policies that either discourage or\npenalize business with certain industries or require\nspecific business practices.\nJPMorganChase's businesses and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by\nnational, state or local governmental authorities\nthat:\nseek to discourage financial institutions from doing\nbusiness with companies engaged in certain industries,\nor conversely, to penalize financial institutions that\nelect not to do business with such companies, or\nmandate specific business practices that companies\noperating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction may\ndiffer or conflict with those in other jurisdictions,\nJPMorganChase may face negative consequences\nregardless of the course of action it takes or elects\nnot to take, including:\nrestrictions or prohibitions on doing business\nwithin a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental\nentities in a jurisdiction\nthe threat of enforcement actions, including under\nantitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and\nregulations, and\nharm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists and\nother stakeholders.\nJPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business activities in specific jurisdictions\nas a result of these types of governmental actions,\nand there is no assurance that it will not face\nsimilar restrictions on its business and operations in\nthe future.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of\nJPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or curtail\nits businesses.\nJPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those\nagencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly\nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorganChase’s\nresolution plan by these agencies may change, and the\nrequirements for resolution plans may be modified from\ntime to time. Any such determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorganChase needing to make changes\nto its legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to\nserve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by\nJPMorganChase has deficiencies, they could jointly\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on JPMorganChase’s\ngrowth, activities or operations. The agencies could\nalso require that JPMorganChase restructure,\nreorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that\ncould materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s\noperations and strategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter into\na resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible\nLTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorganChase’s\noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to\nenter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).\n14\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,\nholders of eligible LTD, other unsecured creditors and\nholders of equity securities of the Parent Company\nwill absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under\nJPMorganChase’s resolution plan contemplates that the\nParent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings and\nJPMorganChase’s material subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue\nnormal operations or subsequently be divested or wound\ndown in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent\nCompany’s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on\nits unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD. Claims of the Parent Company's shareholders and\nunsecured creditors would have a junior position to\nthe claims of creditors of JPMorganChase’s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as\ndetermined by statute) and secured creditors of the\nParent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in\nbankruptcy, unsecured creditors of the Parent Company,\nincluding holders of eligible LTD of the Parent\nCompany, would realize value only to the extent\navailable to the Parent Company as a shareholder of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries,\nand only after any claims of priority and secured\ncreditors of the Parent Company have been fully\nrepaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point\nof entry recapitalization model would be its expected\nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title\nII. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted or\ncommitted to any specific resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into,\na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorganChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and\nlosses to unsecured creditors of the Parent Company,\nincluding holders of eligible LTD, and to holders of\nequity securities of the Parent Company, under\nwhatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be\ngreater than they might have been under\nJPMorganChase’s preferred strategy.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical and geopolitical developments can negatively\nimpact JPMorganChase’s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries\ncan cause uncertainty in the economic environment and\nmarket conditions in which JPMorganChase operates its\nbusinesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives,\nas well as heightened geopolitical tensions,\ncould significantly affect U.S. and global economic\ngrowth and cause higher volatility in the financial\nmarkets, including:\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal\nReserve and other central banks or governmental\nauthorities, including changes in interest rate levels\nand any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any\nsuspension or reversal of those actions\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation\nand spending\nisolationist foreign policies\neconomic or financial sanctions\nthe implementation of tariffs and other\nprotectionist trade policies\nchanges to immigration policies, or\nactions that the government takes or fails to take\nin response to the effects of health emergencies, the\nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty\nabout the possible outcomes of these developments,\ncould:\nerode investor or consumer confidence in the U.S.\neconomy and financial markets, which could potentially\nundermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe\nhaven currency\nprovoke retaliatory countermeasures by other\ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in\nregulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations\nincrease the risk of targeted cyber attacks\nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government\nwill be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at\nany particular time\nresult in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government\ninfluence investor perceptions concerning government\nsupport of certain sectors of the economy or the\neconomy as a whole\ninfluence monetary policy actions of the Federal\nReserve to moderate the economic impact of political\ndevelopments, including decisions on interest rate\nlevels and asset purchases and sales\nadversely affect the financial condition or credit\nratings of clients and counterparties with which\nJPMorganChase does business, or\ncause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging in\nbusiness opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.\nThese factors could lead to:\nslower growth rates, rising inflation or recession\ndisruptions in labor markets\ngreater market volatility\n15",

In addition, sustained low growth, low or\nnegative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand\nfor the products and services offered by\nJPMorganChase’s consumer businesses.\n16\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which\ncan reduce JPMorganChase’s earnings. These\nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain\ngeographies, including where declining industrial or\nmanufacturing activity has resulted in or could result\nin higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels\nof consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans,\ncould impair the ability of customers to pay their\nother consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer businesses\ncould also be adversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration and housing, or that\nmay impact employment status\nlaws, rules and regulations relating specifically to\nthe financial services industry, such as limitations\non late payment, overdraft and interchange fees, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as\nhigher taxes and increased regulation, which could\nresult in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorganChase’s wholesale\nbusinesses.\nIn JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorganChase executes for its clients or for\nwhich it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorganChase receives from those transactions.\nThese factors can also influence the willingness of\nother financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that\nJPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant\nand sustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase’s\nbusinesses engaged in capital markets activities,\nincluding loan syndication, securities underwriting\nand leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to\nthe extent that those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations\nin unfavorable market conditions, or\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss,\nor hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nThe fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing client\nassets or holding assets under custody for clients\ncould be diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuation of client\nassets that JPMorganChase manages or holds under\ncustody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorganChase’s\nrevenue from fees that are based on the amount of\nassets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse\nmacroeconomic or market conditions could prompt\noutflows from JPMorganChase funds or accounts, or\ncause clients to invest in products that generate\nlower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorganChase fund can also hamper the\ninvestment performance of the fund, particularly if\nthe outflows create the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular\nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe\ndownturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, severe declines in commercial real\nestate values, or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that affect specific economic sectors, could\nhave a material adverse effect on clients of\nJPMorganChase whose operations or financial condition\nare directly or indirectly dependent on the health or\nstability of those market segments or economic\nsectors, as well as clients that are engaged in\nrelated businesses. JPMorganChase could incur credit\nlosses on its loans and other commitments to clients\nthat operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of\nthe economy that is or comes under stress.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that results in shifts in consumer and\nbusiness spending could also have a negative impact on\ncertain of JPMorganChase’s wholesale clients, and\nthereby diminish JPMorganChase’s earnings from its\nwholesale operations. For example, the businesses of\ncertain of JPMorganChase’s wholesale clients are\ndependent on consistent streams of rental income from\ncommercial real estate properties, including offices,\nwhich are owned or being built by those clients.\nSustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid work\nmodels could result in reductions in the rental cash\nflows that owners or developers receive from their\ntenants which, in turn, could depress the values of\nthe properties, impair the ability of borrowers to\nservice or refinance their commercial real estate\nloans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These\nconsequences could result in JPMorganChase\nexperiencing increases in the allowance for credit\nlosses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs\nwithin its commercial real estate loan portfolio and\nincurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume\nof delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in\nforeclosures could result in higher operational risk\nassociated with JPMorganChase owning and managing real\nproperty,\n17",
