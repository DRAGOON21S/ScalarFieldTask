          "content": "Part I\nalso impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively\nmanage its credit risk exposure from its market\nactivities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant\nmarket participant, such as a major financial\ninstitution or a CCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market participant or its\nability to fulfill its obligations, can cause\nsubstantial and cascading disruption within the\nfinancial markets, including in circumstances where\ncoordinated action by multiple other market\nparticipants is required to address the failure or\ndisruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event, particularly\nif it leads to other market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or\ndefaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with, and credit\nexposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased\nwhen:\nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the estimated value\nof the collateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning\nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or illiquidity,\nand JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the fair value of\ncollateral or to manage declines in the value of\ncollateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising\nfrom concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market\nrisk to the extent that groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties, or obligors on securities and other\nfinancial instruments:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations to\nbe similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit\nquality of a counterparty, borrower or other obligor\ncould lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of\nother counterparties, borrowers or obligors in\nsimilar, related or dependent industries. This type of\ninterrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s\ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses,\nincluding fair value losses in its market-making\nbusinesses and investment portfolios. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the\nallowance for credit losses or establish other\nreserves with respect to certain clients, industries\nor country exposures in order to align with directives\nor expectations of its banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect\na particular industry or geographic area could lead to\nconcerns about the credit quality of counterparties,\nborrowers or other obligors not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These\nconditions could also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer\nbusinesses who live in those areas or work in those\naffected industries or related or dependent industries\nto meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan\nChase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit and market risk exposures to assess the\npotential risks of concentration or contagion, but its\nability to diversify or hedge its exposure against\nthose risks may be limited.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by\nbank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition\nfor certain types of consumer loans could prompt\nindustry-wide reactions such as significant reductions\nin the pricing or margins of those loans or the making\nof loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently default on their\nloans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an\neconomic downturn or other factors, this could impair\ntheir ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan\nChase and result in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly, widespread\ndefaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s\nconsumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an\nenvironment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks associated\nwith those positions and the level of risk-weighted-\nassets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its\nbalance sheet. These factors could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and\nthe profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase’s liquidity can be impacted at any\ngiven time as a result of factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nchanges in liquidity or capital requirements\nresulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations,\nincluding those in response to economic effects of\nsystemic events\nactions taken by the U.S. government or by the\nFederal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which may\nreduce\n18\ndeposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other financial\ninstitutions\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, periods of market stress, low\ninvestor confidence and significant market illiquidity\ncould result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan\nChase and could limit its access to some of its\ntraditional sources of liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced.\nAlternative sources of funding could be more expensive\nor limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding\ncosts could also be negatively affected by actions\nthat JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net\nstable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively\nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability\nto fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries,\nand thereby adversely affect its results of\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends\non the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments\non its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds\nthe stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings\nLLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The\nIHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany\nlending to the Parent Company.\nThe Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the\nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior\nand subordinated debt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC\nto make payments to the Parent Company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions,\nas well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity\nrequirements and other regulatory restrictions on its\nability to make payments to the Parent Company. The\nIHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the Parent Company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are\notherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management\nor Board of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the\nParent Company to make various payments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect the Parent Company’s ability\nto:\npay interest on its debt securities\npay dividends on its equity securities\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the Parent\nCompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or\notherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a\ntime earlier than would have been the case absent the\nexistence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to\nwhich JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are\nsubject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and\nindustry-specific factors when determining credit\nratings for a particular financial institution,\nincluding:\nexpected future profitability\nrisk management practices\nlegal expenses\nratings differentials between bank holding companies\nand their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\nregulatory developments\nassumptions about government support, and\neconomic and geopolitical developments.\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could influence\nits credit ratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be\ndowngraded in the future. Furthermore, any such\ndowngrade could occur at times of broader market\ninstability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for\nresponding to events may be more limited and general\ninvestor confidence is low.\n19",

          "content": "Part I\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and\nreduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk\non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This\ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving regulatory\nrequirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a Global\nSystemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase\nis required to hold additional capital buffers,\nincluding a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer\n(“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which\nis reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital\nthat JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to\nsatisfy these leverage- and risk-based requirements\ncould increase at any given time due to factors such\nas:\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in\nlaws, rules, and regulations\nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase RWA,\nsuch as increased market risk, customer delinquencies,\nclient credit rating downgrades or other factors, and\nincreases in estimated stress losses as determined\nby the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan\nChase’s SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital\nrequirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan\nChase’s shareholders, such as:\nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan\nChase is permitted to repurchase\nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management\nstrategy\nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\ncurtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or\noperations.\nBanking regulators have released a proposal to amend\nthe Basel III risk-based capital framework which could\nsignificantly revise the risk-based capital\nrequirements for banks with assets of $100 billion or\nmore, including JPMorgan Chase. Uncertainty remains as\nto the manner in which these requirements will\nultimately apply to JPMorgan Chase, however it is\npossible that these requirements could impact JPMorgan\nChase’s decisions concerning the business activities\nin which it will engage and its levels of capital\ndistributions to its shareholders.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of internal and external operational\nsystems.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and report a large\nnumber of transactions on a continuous basis, and to\ndo so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to\nproper design, installation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational systems depends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or\ncorrupted data can significantly compromise the\nfunctionality or reliability of a particular system\nand other systems to which it transmits or from which\nit receives information, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to continue to maintain and\nupgrade its systems on a regular basis in line with\ntechnological advancements and evolving security\nrequirements, carefully manage any changes introduced\nto its systems to maintain security and operational\ncontinuity, and adhere to all applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements, particularly in regions where\nJPMorgan Chase may face a heightened risk of malicious\nactivity.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced and expects that it\nwill continue to experience failures and disruptions\nin the stability of its operational systems, including\ndegraded performance of data processing systems, data\nquality issues, disruptions of network connectivity\nand malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in\nits ability to access and use the operational systems\nof third parties. These incidents have resulted in\nvarious negative effects for customers, including the\ninability to access account information or to make\ntransactions through ATM, internet or mobile channels,\nthe exfiltration of customer personal data, the\nrecording of duplicative transactions and extended\ndelays for customers requiring services from call\n20\ncenters. There can be no assurance that these and\nother types of operational failures or disruptions\nwill not occur in the future.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage the\nstability of its operational systems and\ninfrastructure could be hindered by many factors, any\nof which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan\nChase and its clients, customers and counterparties,\nincluding:\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively maintain and\nupgrade systems and infrastructure can become more\nchallenging as the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of transactions\ncontinue to increase\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase\nor its clients and customers are increasing, evolving\nand becoming more complex, and during periods of\nmarket disruption or economic uncertainty, these\nattempts can be expected to increase in volume\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, could\ncause widespread system disruption\nfailure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in\noperational systems in a timely manner\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems could compound, or migrate to\nother systems over time, to become larger issues\ndisruptions in operational systems or in the ability\nof systems to communicate with each other could be\ncaused by failures in synchronization or encryption\nsoftware, or degraded performance of microprocessors,\nand\nattempts by third parties to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of third parties,\nincluding its custodians, vendors (such as those that\nprovide data and cloud computing services, and\nsecurity and technology services) and other market\nparticipants (such as clearing and payment systems,\nCCPs and securities exchanges), and external\noperational systems with which JPMorgan is connected,\nwhether directly or indirectly, can be sources of\noperational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may\nbe exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber\nattack that may be experienced by a vendor or market\ninfrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly\nconnected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber\nattack involving another party to which such a vendor\nor infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers,\npayment systems and processors, data aggregators and\nother external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s\ncustomers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational risk. This is particularly the case where\nactivities of customers or other parties are beyond\nJPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet,\ncloud computing services, and personal smart phones\nand other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients\nand customers, including a heightened risk of\nfraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s\nsystems, losses from fraudulent transactions and\nreputational harm arising from the perception that\nJPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of\noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to\nthe systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or\nsystems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or\nhuman error or misconduct affecting other external\nparties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems\nor to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial\ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing\nhouses and other financial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that the disruption of an\noperational system involving one institution or\nentity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause\nindustry-wide operational disruptions that could\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct\nbusiness. In addition, the risks associated with the\ndisruption of an operational system of a third party\ncould be exacerbated to the extent that the services\nprovided by that system are used by a significant\nnumber or proportion of market participants.\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,\nincluding due to a systems malfunction, cyber incident\nor other systems failure, could result in unfavorable\nripple effects in the financial markets and for\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers,\nincluding:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services,\nincluding the provision of liquidity or information to\nclients and customers\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s ability to execute\ntransactions, including delays or failures in the\nconfirmation or settlement of transactions or in\nobtaining access to funds or other assets required for\nsettlement\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously\n21",

These\ncyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts\nto introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which\nare commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan\nChase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nsteal money, or\nextort money through the use of so-called\n“ransomware.”\nJPMorgan Chase also experiences:\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks intended to\ndisrupt JPMorgan Chase’s websites, including those\nthat provide online banking and other services,\na higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks\nagainst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical\ntensions, and\na high volume of disruptions to internet-based\nservices used by JPMorgan Chase that are provided by\nthird parties.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due\nto cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable\nthat additional breaches will occur in the future. Any\nsuch breach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide\nabsolute security against cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate, detect or\nrecognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches because:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched or may\ngo undetected for extended periods\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of\nsources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,\ncyber-criminals, hacktivists, well-resourced groups\nlinked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation-\nstates that can sustain malicious activities for\nextended periods, or third parties whose objective is\nto disrupt the operations of financial institutions\nmore generally\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network without\nbeing detected, may gain access to other networks and\nsystems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such as:\nJPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings and\nits internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud computing\nservices\nadvances in artificial intelligence, such as the use\nof machine learning and generative artificial\nintelligence by malicious actors to develop more\nadvanced social engineering attacks, including\ntargeted phishing attacks\nthe inability to maintain the security of\ninformation transmitted by JPMorgan Chase due to\nadvances in quantum computing that may counteract or\nnullify existing information protections, and\nthe acquisition and integration of new businesses.\n22\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile devices used by\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees.\nThe dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape\nnecessitates continuous enhancement and adaptation of\ncybersecurity controls. Failure to discover or address\nknown vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity\ncontrols, or to prioritize or complete enhancements to\naddress them, in each case in a timely manner, may\nleave JPMorgan Chase vulnerable to cyber attacks,\npotentially resulting in data breaches, financial\nlosses, reputational damage and regulatory penalties,\nincluding the failure to prioritize or complete\nenhancements relating to:\npreventing unauthorized access and protecting\nagainst the misuse of access, including the\nmaintenance and enhancement of controls related to\nsecure software development practices and identity and\naccess management, such as those relating to the\nmanagement of administrative access to systems\ndetecting, escalating and addressing effectively and\nin a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be\npresent either in internally-developed software or\nexternally-provided software or services, including\nvulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit\nunknown security flaws in software and hardware\n(“zero-day vulnerabilities”)\nenhancing early detection of attacks against third-\nparty vendors, including attacks targeting\nvulnerabilities in third-party open-source software,\nin support of the secure development and maintenance\nof internal systems\nmaintaining and enhancing controls related to\ntechnology asset management and inventory systems to\nprevent the risk of undetected vulnerabilities that\ncould undermine JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate an\neffective control process\nupgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems\nand controls to protect JPMorgan Chase and its clients\nand customers from the impact of distributed denial-\nof-service attacks, or to recover from outages that\ncould be caused by a malware or ransomware attack\nstrengthening network security and management of\noutbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss\nidentifying, assessing and mitigating insider threat\nactivities that could lead to the misuse of JPMorgan\nChase’s systems or client and customer information,\nand\nintegrating acquired businesses where system\nintegration may be complex or may require extensive\nand lengthy remediation or enhancement of controls.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of\na vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative consequences,\nincluding:\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to operational\nsystems\nmisappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems\nand those of its clients, customers and counterparties\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to\nfully recover and restore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent\nsystems from processing fraudulent transactions\ndemands that JPMorgan Chase pay a ransom to a\nmalicious actor that has perpetrated a cybersecurity\nbreach\nunintended violations by JPMorgan Chase of\napplicable privacy and other laws\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity\nand business resiliency measures\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack, the methods\nand tools used by various actors, and the steps that\nJPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the\nattack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a\nsignificant amount of time before such an\ninvestigation can be completed. While such an\ninvestigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by\nthe cyber attack, and that damage may continue to\nspread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s\nability to provide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and regulators, as well as\nthe public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best\nto contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber\nattack, and certain errors or actions could be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could further\nincrease the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to products,\nservices and delivery platforms or the adoption of new\ntechnologies.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services (including mobile\nconnectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing),\nacquires or invests in a business, makes changes to an\nexisting product, service\n23",

Governmental authorities around the world\nhave adopted and are considering the adoption of\nnumerous legislative and regulatory initiatives\nconcerning privacy, data protection and security.\nLitigation or enforcement actions relating to these\nlaws, rules and regulations could result in\nfines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change\nits data-related practices, which could have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide\nproducts and otherwise harm its business operations.\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws, rules\nand regulations in all relevant jurisdictions,\nincluding where the laws of different jurisdictions\nare in conflict, can:\nincrease JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating\ncosts\nhinder the development of new products or services,\ncurtail the offering of existing products or services,\nor affect how products and services are offered to\nclients and customers\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s\nmanagement, and\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses,\noperations and systems in less efficient ways.\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties may\nhave appropriate controls in place to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of the\ninformation exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase,\nparticularly where information is transmitted by\nelectronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions if personal information of clients,\ncustomers, employees or others were to be mishandled\nor misused, such as situations where such information\nis:\n24\nerroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized\nthird parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or\nthe perception that those measures are inadequate,\ncould cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or\npotential clients and customers or employees, and\nthereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to\ncomply with applicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations, or any failure to\nappropriately calibrate, manage and monitor access by\nemployees or third parties to personal information,\ncould subject JPMorgan Chase to inquiries,\nexaminations and investigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain operations or\npractices, significant liabilities or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these\ncould damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise\nadversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving\nthe inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage\nof personal information have led to expanded\ngovernmental scrutiny of practices relating to the\nprocessing or safeguarding of personal information by\ncompanies in the U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in\nthe future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules and regulations relating to the collection, use,\nsharing and storage of personal information. These\ntypes of laws, rules and regulations can prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms such\nas JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across\nnational borders or sharing information among\naffiliates or with third parties such as vendors,\nthereby increase compliance costs and operational\nrisk, or restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal\ninformation when developing or offering products or\nservices to customers. Some countries are considering\nor have adopted legislation implementing data\nprotection requirements or requiring local storage and\nprocessing of data which could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products\nand services. These restrictions could also inhibit\nJPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain\nproducts or services, or increase the costs of\noffering them to customers.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation\ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events\nbeyond its control.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems\ncould be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could\nbe harmed, by events or contributing factors that are\nwholly or partially beyond its control, including\nmaterial instances of:\ncyber attacks\nsecurity breaches of its physical premises,\nincluding threats to health and safety\npower, telecommunications or internet outages, or\nshutdowns of mass transit\nfailure of, or loss of access to, technology or\noperational systems, including any resulting loss of\ncritical data\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan\nChase or third parties, and any consequent injuries,\nincluding in connection with any construction projects\nundertaken by JPMorgan Chase\neffects of climate change\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\naccidents such as explosions or structural failures\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\nevents arising from local or larger-scale civil or\npolitical unrest, any outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program\nthat is designed to enable it to prepare for, adapt\nto, withstand and recover from business disruptions\nthat may impact critical business functions and\nsupporting assets, including staff, technology, third\nparty service providers and facilities, in the event\nof a business disruption, including due to the\noccurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its\ncontrol. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all\npotential business resiliency risks to JPMorgan Chase,\nits clients, and customers and third parties with\nwhich it does business, or that its resiliency plans\nwill be adequate to address the effects of\nsimultaneous occurrences of multiple business\ndisruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s\nability to respond effectively to a business\ndisruption event could be hampered to the extent that\nthe members of its workforce, physical assets or\nsystems and other support infrastructure needed to\naddress the event are geographically dispersed, or\nconversely, if such an event were to occur in an area\nin which they are concentrated. Further, should\nextraordinary events or the factors that cause or\ncontribute to those events become more chronic, the\ndisruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusiness and operations, and on its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and employees, could become\nmore significant and long-lasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan\nChase’s operations or operational systems, or the\noccurrence of one or more extraordinary events that\nare beyond its control, could:\nhinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services\nto its clients and customers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including\nfrom loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\n25",

Actual results associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition may differ from the\nanticipated positive results, including with respect\nto:\nthe settlement of the final purchase price\nthe total cost of integration\nthe time required to complete the integration\nthe overall performance of the assets and\nliabilities acquired in the First Republic\nacquisition, or\nan improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock.\nIntegration of an acquired business can be complex and\ncostly, and involves the combination of relevant\naccounting and data processing systems and management\ncontrols, as well as managing relevant relationships\nwith employees, clients, suppliers and other business\npartners. The integration process could result in the\ndisruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in\nstandards, controls, procedures and policies that\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to\nmaintain relationships with clients and customers. In\naddition, the loss of key employees in connection with\nthe First Republic acquisition could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to successfully conduct its\nbusiness.\nJPMorgan Chase could also incur unanticipated costs or\nlosses in connection with the First Republic\nacquisition, including if JPMorgan Chase fails to\ncomply with the conditions of the shared-loss\nagreements with the FDIC related to certain loans and\nlending-related commitments, which could diminish the\ncoverage of the credit losses these agreements are\ndesigned to provide.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers can\nresult in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing business\nwith vendors and other service providers, including\nstandards\nrelating to the outsourcing of functions as well as\nthe performance of significant banking and other\nfunctions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection with its\ninitiatives to address the risks associated with\noversight of its internal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately\nassess and manage these relationships, especially\nthose involving significant banking functions, shared\nservices or other critical activities, could\nmaterially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase.\nSpecifically, any such failure could result in:\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost\nrevenues\nincreased operational costs, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and control\nenvironment may not be effective in identifying and\nmitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure, practices,\nmodels or reporting systems, or in its control\nenvironment could expose it to unexpected losses, and\nits financial condition or results of operations could\nbe materially and adversely affected. Any such\ninadequacy or lapse could:\nhinder the timely escalation of material risk issues\nto JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of\nDirectors\nlead to business decisions that have negative\noutcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nrequire significant resources and time to remediate\nlead to non-compliance with laws, rules and\nregulations\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nlead to potential harm to customers and clients, and\nany liability associated with that harm\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various\nrisk exposures. Any deficiencies in the accuracy,\ntimeliness or completeness of data, or the\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering,\nanalysis and validation processes could result in\nineffective risk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in inaccurate or\nuntimely risk reporting.\n26\nMany of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior and\nto some degree are based on management’s subjective\njudgment or assumptions. For example, many models used\nby JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding\nhistorical correlations among prices of various asset\nclasses or other market indicators. In times of market\nstress, including difficult or less liquid market\nenvironments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic movements could, in some circumstances, limit\nthe effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management\nstrategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations\nor judgments, including those used in its financial\nstatements, are inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital, liquidity,\noperational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses\ninternal models and estimations as a basis for its\nstress testing and in connection with the preparation\nof its financial statements under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of\nassumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The\nmodels and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses,\nincluding those that use machine learning, artificial\nintelligence or quantum computing, may not be\neffective in all cases to identify, observe and\nmitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist\nin the future, including assumptions underlying the\nmodels and estimations such as correlations among\ncertain market indicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or\nmay not be indicative of severely negative market\nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or\nlack of liquidity\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices\nof certain loans and securities may make it more\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be\nwell understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, and\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models\nand estimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or the\npreparation of its financial statements are inadequate\nor incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices\nare not available for certain financial instruments\nthat require a determination of their fair value,\nJPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations\nbased on internally developed models or other means\nwhich ultimately rely to some degree on management\nestimates and judgment. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nmay experience increased uncertainty in its estimates\nif assets acquired differ from those used to develop\nthose models, which may lead to unexpected losses.\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for\nexpected credit losses related to its credit exposures\nwhich requires significant judgments, including\nforecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers\nto repay their loans or other obligations. These types\nof estimates and judgments may not prove to be\naccurate due to a variety of factors, including when\nthe current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed. The\nincreased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree\nof judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments\nthat JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than\nwould otherwise be the case.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing\nrisks are subject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These\nreviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations for calculating market\nrisk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA\nunder Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or\nestimations are not approved by its regulators, it may\nbe subject to higher capital charges, which could\nadversely affect its financial results or limit the\nability to expand its businesses.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial\nreporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability or reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations,\nboth within and outside the U.S., requiring continuous\nenhancements to various disclosures in its financial\nstatements and regulatory reports.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective\nin every circumstance, or that a material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency in internal control over\nfinancial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or\ndeficiencies could result in inaccurate financial\nreporting which, in turn, could:\n27",

These\nstrategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\nthe methods, distribution channels and third party\nservice providers by or through which it offers\nproducts and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and\ngoals that prove to be incorrect, are based on\nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do\nnot accurately assess the competitive landscape and\nindustry trends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or the expectations\nof clients, customers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values and growth\nprospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer\nand its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective\nbusiness plans to address these strategic priorities,\nboth in the near term and over longer time horizons.\nManagement’s effectiveness in this regard will affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term\nstability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest\nin\nmarket-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed\nenvironment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\nappropriately assess and monitor principal\ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate JPMorgan\nChase's business strategies\nconduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or effectively\nintegrate newly-acquired businesses\nappropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to climate and\nother ESG matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary to\ngrow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services\nindustry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to\nchanges in financial regulation, technological\nadvances, increased public scrutiny and changes in\neconomic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global financial services\nindustry will continue to be intense. Competitors\ninclude:\nother banks and financial institutions\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\nfinance companies\ntechnology companies, and\nother non-bank firms that are engaged in providing\nsimilar as well as new products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations. For example, aggressive\nor less disciplined lending practices by non-bank\ncompetitors could lead to a loss of market share for\ntraditional banks, and in an economic downturn could\nresult in instability in the financial services\nindustry and adversely impact other market\nparticipants, including JPMorgan Chase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-\n28\ndepository institutions to offer products and services\nthat traditionally were banking products. These\nadvances have also allowed financial institutions and\nother companies to provide electronic and internet-\nbased financial solutions, including electronic\nsecurities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and\nother extensions of credit to consumers, payments\nprocessing and online automated algorithmic-based\ninvestment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other products\nand services, including deposits and other traditional\nbanking products, could be significantly disrupted by\nthe use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies\nand other applications using secure distributed\nledgers, that may not require intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could require JPMorgan\nChase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to\nattract and retain clients and customers or to match\nproducts and services offered by its competitors,\nincluding technology companies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers, or breached or\ninfiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways,\nwhich can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations that apply\nto the offering of products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase\nearns from providing products and services through\nthose technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on\nthe pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share,\nparticularly with respect to traditional banking\nproducts. This competition may be based on quality and\nvariety of products and services offered, transaction\nexecution, innovation, reputation and price. The\nfailure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet\nthe expectations of clients and customers, whether due\nto general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or service,\nchanges in client and customer expectations or other\nfactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to\nattract or retain clients and customers. Any such\nimpact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s\nrevenues. Increased competition also may require\nJPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments\nin its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on\nbehalf of its clients to remain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both\ndirectly and as a result of impacts on its clients and\ncustomers.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its business, and\nthe activities of its clients and customers, could be\nadversely affected by climate change. Climate change\ncould manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase\neither through changes in the physical climate or from\nthe process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\nBoth physical risks and transition risks associated\nwith climate change could have negative impacts on the\nfinancial condition or\ncreditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers,\nand on its exposure to those clients and customers.\nPhysical risks include the increased frequency or\nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods,\nwildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in\nthe climate, such as persistent changes in\nprecipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases\nin average ambient temperature. Potential adverse\nimpacts of climate-related physical risks include:\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\nreduced availability or increased cost of insurance\nfor clients of JPMorgan Chase\ninterruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\npopulation migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to a\nlow-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy,\nadoption of new technologies or changes in consumer\npreferences towards low-carbon goods and services.\nThese risks could also be influenced by changes in the\nphysical climate. Potential adverse impacts of\ntransition risks include:\nsudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by\nchanges in climate policy\nincreased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as emission pricing and\naccelerated decarbonization policies\nnegative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due\nto any perception that its business practices are\ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\nClimate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and\nconflicts in the manner in which climate policy and\nfinancial regulations are implemented in the many\nregions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including\ninitiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation\nwith extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal\nmodels and estimations used in climate risk\nassessments have an increased level of uncertainty due\nto limited historical trend information and the\nabsence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive\ngreenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to\ninaccurate disclosures or financial reporting.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm\nclients and customers, impact market integrity, damage\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and\nregulatory action.\n29",

Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral component of JPMorgan\nChase’s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in improper\nor illegal conduct in the past. These instances of\nmisconduct have resulted in litigation, and\nresolutions of governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred\nprosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and\nother civil or criminal sanctions. There is no\nassurance that further inappropriate or unlawful\nactions by employees have not occurred or will not\noccur, lead to a violation of the terms of these\nresolutions (and associated consequences), or that any\nsuch actions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a failure\nby one or more employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations,\npolicies and practices, including by acting in ways\nthat harm clients, customers, other market\nparticipants, employees or others.

This latter risk can be magnified by the speed\nand pervasiveness with which information is\ndisseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists have been\nincreasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial services firms with public criticism\nconcerning their business practices, including\nbusiness relationships with clients that are engaged\nin certain sensitive industries, such as companies:\nwhose products are or are perceived to be harmful to\nhuman health, or\nwhose activities negatively affect or are perceived\nto negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights\nor communities.\nActivists have also taken actions intended to change\nor influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with\nrespect to ESG matters, including public protests at\nJPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties,\nand submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a\nvote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase and other companies have\nbeen and continue to be criticized by activists,\npoliticians and other members of the public concerning\npositions taken with respect to matters of public\npolicy. These criticisms can be more widespread during\nelection years in various jurisdictions, and could\nhave the effect of focusing attention on a company\nsuch as JPMorgan Chase as part of a wider public\ndebate on public policy matters.\nThese and other types of criticism and actions\ndirected at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender\ndissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors,\nemployees, government officials and other\nstakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation and its business and results of operations\ncould be harmed by :\ngreater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies, or further criticism from politicians and\nother members of the public\nunfavorable coverage or commentary in the media,\nincluding through social media campaigns\ncertain clients and customers ceasing doing business\nwith JPMorgan Chase, and encouraging others to do so\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract\nnew clients and customers, to expand its relationships\nwith existing clients and customers, or to hire or\nretain employees, or\ncertain investors opting to divest from investments\nin securities of JPMorgan Chase.\nActions by the financial services industry generally\nor individuals in the industry can also affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged\nby concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial\ninstitution, or\na financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products to\ncustomers.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers, employees or\nother stakeholders.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of\ninterest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as well\nas damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts\nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which encompass a variety\nof transactions, obligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan\nChase can become subject to litigation, enforcement\nactions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its\nreputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived\nfailure to:\nadequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts\nof interest that may arise in connection with\nproviding multiple products and services in, or having\none or more investments related to, the same\ntransaction\nidentify and address any conflict of interest that a\nthird party with which it is does business may have\nwith respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\n31",

Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly involved in such a\nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any\noperations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well as in any nation\nthat is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and\naggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such\na conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts\nbusiness have economies or markets that are less\ndeveloped and more volatile or may have political,\nlegal and regulatory regimes that are less established\nor predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan\nChase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local\neconomy and business activities are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or control. Some of\nthese countries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt a nd\nincreased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive\npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, such as:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of\ngovernment actions can negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations in the relevant country, either\ndirectly or by suppressing the business activities of\nlocal clients or multi-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor\neconomic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general\nstrikes\ncrime and corruption\nsecurity and personal safety issues\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other\ngeopolitical instabilities\noverthrow of incumbent governments\nterrorist attacks, and\n32\nother forms of internal discord.\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in the\nfuture could lead to, conditions that can adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries\nand impair the revenues, growth and profitability of\nthose operations. In addition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations and investments in another country\nor countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial services\nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented\nand diverse new employees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's\nefforts to hire and retain talented and diverse\nemployees could be hindered by factors such as:\nthe emerging need for more-skilled workers in an\nevolving labor and workplace environment, including\ndue to changes in technology, and\ntargeted recruitment of JPMorgan Chase employees by\ncompetitors.\nIf JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract\nor retain qualified and diverse employees, including\nsuccessors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of\nthe Operating Committee and other senior leaders,\nJPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its\ncompetitive position, could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chase’s use of hybrid work models could\nresult in deterioration in employee performance or\ndegradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment\nwhich may have a material and adverse effect on its\nbusiness and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing\nhybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto attract and retain employees.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the world.\nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S.\nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise\nmake it more difficult for employees or their family\nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between,\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations\nor conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees, and thereby dilute the quality of its\nworkforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make\nstructural changes to its worldwide or regional\noperating models that cause its operations to be less\nefficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise\ninvolved in many legal proceedings, including class\nactions, derivative actions and other litigation or\ndisputes with third parties, as well as criminal\nproceedings. Actions currently pending against\nJPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to\nJPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially\nand adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations, or cause\nserious reputational harm. As a participant in the\nfinancial services industry, it is likely that\nJPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high\nlevel of litigation and regulatory and government\ninvestigations related to its businesses and\noperations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nThere is no assurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other enforcement actions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law or regulation\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and officials in the\nU.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business activity\nor practice, this will often give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other governmental\nagencies of the same or similar activity or practice\nby JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to cease\noffering certain products or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation or lead to higher operational costs,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In addition, the\nextent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of reserves that\nJPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.\n33\nParts I and II",

Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and\n31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, respectively.\nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nNevertheless, because of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or\nlapses in internal controls may occur from time to\ntime, and there can be no assurance that any such\ndeficiencies will not result in significant\ndeficiencies or material weaknesses in internal\ncontrol in the future and collateral consequences\ntherefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting” on page 162 for\nfurther information.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired certain assets and\nassumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank\nfrom the FDIC.

Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $49.6 billion for 2023,\nup 32%, earnings per share of $16.23, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%. • Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%,\nreflecting:\n– Net interest income (“NII”) of $89.3 billion, up 34%, driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and\nhigher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average\ndeposit balances. NII excluding Markets was $90.0 billion, up 44%. – Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $68.8 billion,\nup 11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, higher\nMarkets noninterest revenue, and higher asset management fees, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the\nsale of Visa B shares in the prior year, higher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and lower auto operating\nlease income. • Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense,\nreflecting an increase in employees, primarily in technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The\nincrease in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and costs associated with the First\nRepublic acquisition. • The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-\noffs and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single name exposures in wholesale. The net addition\nto the allowance for credit losses included: – a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by\nCCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances,\npartially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and – a net addition of $657 million in\nwholesale , driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB.\nThe net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $2.9 billion. • The total allowance for credit losses was\n$24.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of\n1.75%, compared with 1.81% in the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at December\n31, 2023, up 5%, predominantly driven by wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of downgrades.\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–130 and pages 114–119, respectively,\nfor additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    49\nFirmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%,\npredominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB,\nprimarily as a result of First Republic.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down\n4%, driven by\n– continued migration into higher-yielding investments\nin AWM, the impact of higher customer spending in CCB,\ncontinued deposit attrition in CB, and a net decline\nin CIB, which included actions taken to reduce certain\ndeposits,\npartially offset by\n– the increase in deposits associated with First\nRepublic, and growth related to the Firm’s\ninternational consumer initiatives in Corporate.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109\nfor additional information.\nSelected capital and other metrics\nCET1 capital was $251 billion, and the Standardized\nand Advanced CET1 ratios were both 15.0%.\nSLR was 6.1%.\nTBVPS grew 18%, ending 2023 at $86.08.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-\nof-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of\napproximately $798 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $649\nbillion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67, and\nNotes 6 and 34 for additional information. 2023 compared with 2022 Investment banking fees decreased, reflecting in\nCIB: • lower advisory fees due to a lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced\ndeals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging environment, and • lower debt underwriting fees as\nchallenging market conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity across\nleveraged loans, investment-grade loans and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher issuance activity\nin high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance, partially offset by • higher equity underwriting fees\ndriven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of\nconvertible securities offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private\nplacements amid a challenging environment. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 72–77 and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Equity Markets principal\ntransactions revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, • higher Fixed Income Markets principal transactions\nrevenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income\nFinancing, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets; – the net increase in\nMarkets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets net interest income, primarily\ndue to higher funding costs; and • losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared with $836 million\nin the prior year. The prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded\ncommitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. The increase in principal transactions revenue also\nincluded the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO, reflective of the current\ninterest rate environment. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines,\nincluding net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue\nbasis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 72–77 and pages 84–85, respectively, and Note 6 for\nadditional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting: • higher lending-related revenue\ndriven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with\nFirst Republic, primarily in AWM and CB, predominantly offset by • lower deposit-related fees in CB and CIB driven\nby the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees. Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages\n72–77, pages 78–80 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management fees\nincreased driven by strong net inflows and the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year in\nAWM, and in CCB the impact of First Republic, as well as higher average market levels and strong net inflows.

Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion,\nconsisting of $2.6 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio continued to\nnormalize to pre-pandemic levels, and $698 million in wholesale. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses included $1.9 billion, consisting of: • $1.3 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting a\n$1.4 billion net addition in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending.\nThe net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially\noffset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook\nfor home prices; and • $657 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity and the net effect of changes\nin the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real\nestate in CB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The\nnet addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023.\nThe provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses ,\nconsisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in\nthe Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in\nuncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually receded, and net charge-offs\nof $2.9 billion.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business\ndue to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and\nmarket conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources,\nand its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating\nliquidity needs. • In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, lower other assets, and accrued interest\nand accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, lower accounts payable and other\nliabilities, and higher securities borrowed. • In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and\nother liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans\nheld-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets.\nInvesting activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans,\ninvesting in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. • In 2023, cash provided\nresulted from net proceeds from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-\ninvestment and lower securities purchased under resale agreements, largely offset by net originations of loans and\nnet cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition. • In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans\nand higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment\nsecurities. Financing activities The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing\nlong-term debt and preferred stock. • In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the\nrepayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm\nassumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher securities loaned under repurchase\nagreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits,\npartially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for\nrepurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance\nSheets Analysis on pages 58–60, Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages\n102–109, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 170 for a further discussion of the activities\naffecting the Firm’s cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    61\nEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE\nOF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 166–170. That\npresentation, which is referred to as “reported”\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results,\nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results\nof the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition\nof managed basis starts, in each case, with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments\nthat receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable\nto taxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense. These adjustments have no impact on net\nincome as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the\nLOBs.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment level\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the underlying\noperational performance and trends of the Firm or of\nthe particular business segment, as the case may be,\nand therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or\nthe business segment with the performance of its\nrelevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment\nResults on pages 65–85 for additional information on\nthese non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures\nused by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly\nnamed non-GAAP financial measures used by other\ncompanies.\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation\nfrom the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed\nbasis.\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…\nm…                    Fu…                                     F…                                Fu…\ne…       20…          ta…           Ma…          20…          t…       Ma…          2…          ta…       M…\nr…       Re…          ad…           ba…          Re…          a…       ba…          R…          ad…       b…\nO…    $  5,…       $  3,…        $  9,…       $  4,…       $  3…    $  7,…       $  4…       $  3,…    $  8…\ni…\nT…\nn…       68…          3,…           72…          61…          3…       65…          6…          3,…       7…\nr…\nN…\ni…       89…          480           89…          66…          4…       67…          5…          430       5…\ni…\nT…\nn…       15…          4,…           16…          12…          3…       13…          1…          3,…       1…\nr…\nT…\nn…       87…               NA       87…          76…          NA       76…          7…           NA       7…\ne…\nP…       70…          4,…           75…          52…          3…       56…          5…          3,…       5…\np…\nP…\nf…       9,…               NA       9,…          6,…          NA       6,…          -…           NA       -…\nc…\nl…\nI…\nb…\ni…       61…          4,…           65…          46…          3…       49…          5…          3,…       6…\nt…\ne…\nI…\nt…       12…          4,…           16…          8,…          3…       12…          1…          3,…       1…\ne…\nN…    $  49…               NA    $  49…       $  37…          NA    $  37…       $  4…           NA    $  4…\ni…\nO…        55  %            NM        54  %        59  %       NM        58  %       59  %        NM       57  %\nr…\n(a) Predominantly recognized in CIB, CB and Corporate.\n62    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNet interest income, net yield, and noninterest\nrevenue excluding Markets In addition to reviewing net\ninterest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue on\na managed basis, management also reviews these metrics\nexcluding Markets, as shown below.

The reorganization\nof the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page\n52 for additional information.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements\nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on\nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products\nand services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the\nparticipating business segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to the other\nsegment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment\nresults reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments\nrelated to corporate support units, technology and\noperations that are not currently utilized by any LOB\nare not allocated to the business segments and are\nretained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate\ngenerally includes costs that would not be incurred if\nthe segments were stand-alone businesses, and other\nitems not solely aligned with a particular business\nsegment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the\nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and\nCIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the segments.\nAs a result of the higher interest rate environment,\nthe cost of funds for assets and the credits earned\nfor liabilities have generally increased, impacting\nthe business segments’ net interest income. During the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, this has resulted in\nhigher cost of funds for loans and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    65\nMarkets activities, and contributed to margin\nexpansion on deposits.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these\nrisks centrally and reports the impact of foreign\nexchange rate movements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management\non page 143 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost\nall of the cost of the credit spread component of\noutstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the reportable\nbusiness segments, while the balance of the cost is\nretained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the\ncost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with the\nrelevant regulatory capital requirements and funding\nneeds of the LOBs, as applicable.\nThe allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is\nincluded in a business segment’s net interest income,\nand net income is reduced by preferred stock\ndividends, to arrive at a business segment’s net\nincome applicable to common equity.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for\nadditional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current\nallocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the\nglobal systemically important banks (“GSIB”)\nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as\nwell as a simulation of capital in a severe stress\nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions,\njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital\nare reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change.\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 98 for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\nSegment Results – Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.\n…                                        …\n&                                        &                                        …\n…                                        …                                        …\n…  …        …               …            …  …        …               …            …        …           …\n$     …  $     …    …    $     …    …    $  …     $     …    …    $     …    …    $  …     $     …  $     …\n…        …    …          …    …       …           …    …          …    …       …           …        …\n…        …               …            …           …               …            …           …        …\n…        …               …            …           …               …            …           …        …\n…        …    …          …    …       …           …    …          …    …       …           …        …\n…  %     …  %            …  %            …  %     …  %            …  %            …  %     …  %     …  %\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…       As…\nm…         &\ne…       We…\nr…       Ma…  20…         20…         20…       C…  20…       2…       20…       T…  20…         2…         20…\nT…\nn…    $  19…       $      17…  $      16…    $      8,…  $    80  $    -3…    $      16…  $      1…  $      12…\nr…\nT…\nn…       12…              11…         10…           5,…       1…       1,…           87…         7…         71…\ne…\nP…       7,…              5,…         6,…           2,…       -…       -5…           75…         5…         53…\np…\nP…\nf…       159              128         -2…           171       22        81           9,…         6…         -9…\nc…\nl…\nN…       5,…              4,…         4,…           2,…       -…       -3…           49…         3…         48…\ni…\nR…\non        31  %       25    %     33    %            NM       NM        NM       17    %     14   %     19    %\ne…\n(…\n(a) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services\nrevenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB.

Net\ninterchange income in Card Services also reflected the\nimpact of a reduction in rewards costs and partner\npayments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a\nperiodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed and an\nincrease to the rewards liability due to adjustments\nto certain reward program terms in the second quarter\nof 2023;\nhigher travel-related commissions in Card Services,\npredominantly offset by\nlower auto operating lease income as a result of a\ndecline in volume, and\nlower mortgage fees and related income in Home\nLending.\nRefer to Note 6 for additional information on card\nincome,\nasset management fees, and commissions and other fees;\nand Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 155–158 for\ncredit card rewards liability.\nRefer to Note 15 for further information regarding\nchanges in the value of the MSR asset and related\nhedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\nRefer to Note 34 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\nNoninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%,\nreflecting:\nhigher compensation expense, driven by an increase\nin employees, including the impact of First Republic\nin the second half of 2023 and additions primarily in\nbankers, advisors and technology, wage inflation and\nhigher revenue-related compensation, as well as\nhigher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact\nof First Republic, investments in marketing and\ntechnology, the increase in the FDIC assessment\nannounced in the prior year as well as higher legal\nexpense, partially offset by lower auto lease\ndepreciation on lower auto lease assets.\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion,\nreflecting:\nnet charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, as the\nportfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic\nlevels,\na $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card\nServices, partially offset by a net reduction of $200\nmillion in Home Lending. The net addition in Card\nServices was driven by loan growth, including an\nincrease in revolving balances, partially offset by\nreduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in\nHome Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook\nfor home prices; and\n$408 million to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans and lending-related commitments\nin the second quarter of 2023.\nThe provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion,\ndriven by net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a $1.1\nbillion net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses across CCB.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 111–134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages\n131–133 for a further discussion of the credit\nportfolios and the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    69\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except employees)                       2023                    2022                2021\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets                                $      642,951          $      514,085  $    500,370\nLoans:\nBanking & Wealth Management(a)                      31,142    -d            29,008        35,095\nHome Lending(b)                                    259,181    -d           172,554       180,529\nCard Services                                      211,175                 185,175       154,296\nAuto                                                77,705                  68,191        69,138\nTotal loans                                        579,203                 454,928       439,058\nDeposits                                         1,094,738    -e         1,131,611     1,148,110\nEquity                                              55,500                  50,000        50,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets                                $      584,367          $      497,263  $    489,771\nLoans:\nBanking & Wealth Management                         30,142    -f            31,545        44,906\nHome Lending(c)                                    232,115    -f           176,285       181,049\nCard Services                                      191,424                 163,335       140,405\nAuto                                                72,674                  68,098        67,624\nTotal loans                                        526,355                 439,263       433,984\nDeposits                                         1,126,552    -g         1,162,680     1,054,956\nEquity                                              54,349                  50,000        50,000\nEmployees                                          141,640                 135,347       128,863\n(a) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, included $94\nmillion, $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans,\nrespectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.

Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-\nsale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the\nbridge financing portfolio recorded in the second\nquarter of 2022, Investment Banking revenue was down\n8%. Investment Banking fees were down 5%, driven by\nlower advisory and debt underwriting fees, partially\noffset by higher equity underwriting fees. T he Firm\nranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,\naccording to Dealogic.\n– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion , dow n 8%, due to a\nlower number of completed transactions, reflecting the\nlower level of announced deals in the current and the\nprior year amid a challenging environment.\n– Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down 8%,\nas challenging market conditions, primarily in the\nfirst half of the year, resulted in lower issuance\nactivity across leveraged loans, investment-grade\nloans, and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset\nby higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven\nby higher industry-wide issuance.\n– Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 11%,\ndriven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to\nlower equity market volatility and a higher level of\nconvertible securities offerings which benefited from\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower activity in\nprivate placements amid a challenging environment.\nPayments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven by\ndeposit margin expansion on higher rates and fees,\npartially offset by the higher level of client credits\nthat reduce such fees and lower average deposits. The\nnet impact of equity investments was flat reflecting\nnet markdowns in both periods, including the impact of\nan impairment in the current year.\nLending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%, driven\nby $494 million of fair value losses on hedges of\nretained loans which included an increase in hedging\nactivity, compared to $27 million of gains in the\nprior year, partially offset by higher net interest\nincome.\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3\nbillion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8 billion,\ndown 4%.\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion, up\n1%, driven by an increase in finance and trading\nactivity in the Securitized Products Group and\nimproved performance in Credit Trading, predominantly\noffset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging\nMarkets as the business substantially normalized from\nthe prior year’s elevated levels of volatility and\nclient activity.\nEquity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down 13%,\ndriven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash\nEquities, compared with a stronger performance in the\nprior year.\nSecurities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%,\ndriven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates,\nlargely offset by lower average deposits and fees.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280\nmillion, compared with a loss of $836 million in the\nprior year.\nNoninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%, driven\nby higher legal expense, compensation expense,\nincluding the impact of wage inflation, and higher\nindirect tax expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $121 million,\ndriven by net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190\nmillion, driven by single name exposures, largely\noffset by a $151 million net reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses.\nThe net reduction in the allowance was driven by the\nimpact of changes in the loan and lending-related\ncommitment portfolios and the net effect of changes in\nthe Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook,\npredominantly offset by an addition for certain\naccounts receivable and net downgrade activity.\nThe provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion,\npredominantly driven by a net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    73\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31, (in millions, except employees)  2023                  2022                  2021\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets                                        $  1,338,168          $  1,334,296          $  1,259,896\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                        197,523               187,642               159,786\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                     38,919                42,304                50,386\nvalue(b)\nTotal loans                                              236,442               229,946               210,172\nEquity                                                   108,000               103,000                83,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets                                        $  1,428,904          $  1,406,250          $  1,334,518\nTrading assets-debt and equity                           508,799               405,916               448,099\ninstruments\nTrading assets-derivative receivables                     63,836                77,802                68,203\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                        190,601               172,627               145,137\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                     39,831                46,846                51,072\nvalue(b)\nTotal loans                                              230,432               219,473               196,209\nDeposits                                                 728,537               739,700               760,048\nEquity                                                   108,000               103,000                83,000\nEmployees                                                 74,404                73,452                67,546\n(a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans,\nloans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for-\ninvestment loans and overdrafts.

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.\nMarkets revenue consists of principal transactions,\nfees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets\nbusiness performance on a total revenue basis, as\noffsets generally occur across revenue line items. For\nexample, securities that generate net interest income\nmay be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected\nat fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer\nto Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition\nof these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise\nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal\ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon\nexecuting new transactions with market participants,\nas well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is\nrevenue recognized from gains and losses on\nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to,\nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments used by the Firm to actively manage the\nrisk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new\ntransactions with market participants is affected by\nmany factors including the level of client activity,\nthe bid-offer spread (which is the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an instrument\nto the Firm and the price at which another market\nparticipant is willing and able to buy it from the\nFirm, and vice versa), market liquidity and\nvolatility. These factors are interrelated and\nsensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market\nconditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity\nprices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    75\nFor the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized\nupon executing new transactions.\nYe…\nen…\nDe…\n31,\n(in\nmi…\nex…       2023                                2022                                2021\nwh…       Fix…                                Fix…                                Fix…\not…       Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…\nno…       Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…\nPr…    $  12,…    $  11,…    $  23,…       $  11,…    $  8,8…    $  20,…       $  7,9…    $  7,5…    $  15,…\ntr…\nLe…\nand        307         40        347           303         22        325           321         17        338\nde…\nfe…\nCo…\nand        596       1,9…       2,5…           550       1,9…       2,5…           545       1,9…       2,4…\not…\nfe…\nAll\not…       1,7…        -87       1,6…           916        -99        817           972        -82        890\nin…\nNo…       14,…       13,…       28,…          13,…       10,…       24,…          9,7…       9,4…       19,…\nre…\nNet\nin…       4,1…       -4,…       -294          5,1…       -377       4,7…          7,1…       1,1…       8,2…\nin…\nTo…\nnet    $  18,…    $  8,9…    $  27,…       $  18,…    $  10,…    $  28,…       $  16,…    $  10,…    $  27,…\nre…\nLo…                                   3                                   7                                   4\nda…\n(a) The decline in Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.\n(b) Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets, posted losses to total net revenue.

Net interest\nincome was $12.1 billion, up 47%, driven by: • deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower\naverage deposits, and • higher average loans, including the impact from First Republic. Noninterest revenue was\n$3.5 billion, up 5%, driven by: • higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by the amortization of the\npurchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, • net markups on\nheld-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, compared with net\nmarkdowns in the prior year, and • higher investment banking revenue and card income, predominantly offset by\nlower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of client credits that reduce such fees, and • the absence of a\ngain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan. Noninterest expense was $5.4\nbillion, up 14%, driven by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in employees including front office\nand technology, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisitions. The\nprovision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting: • a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, driven by the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a\ndeterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate and net downgrade activity, partially offset by the impact\nof changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, • $608 million to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023; and • net charge-offs of $316\nmillion, up $232 million, primarily driven by Real Estate, predominantly concentrated in Office.

Revenue from Asset Management was\n$9.1 billion, up 4%, driven by: • a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's\nacquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, and • higher asset management fees driven by strong net\ninflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements, as well as the removal of most money\nmarket fund fee waivers in the prior year, largely offset by • lower performance fees, and • lower NII due to\nhigher funding costs. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by: • higher net interest\nincome on higher average loans associated with First Republic, and from deposit margin expansion on higher rates,\nlargely offset by lower average deposits, and • higher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the\namortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First\nRepublic, partially offset by net investment valuation losses. Noninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%,\npredominantly driven by higher compensation, including continued growth in private banking advisor teams, revenue-\nrelated compensation and the impacts of closing the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China\nacquisitions. The provision for credit losses was $159 million, predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    81\nAsset Management has two high-level measures of\nits overall fund performance.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF\nassets under management in funds rated 4- or\n5-star:\nMutual fund rating services rank funds based on\ntheir risk adjusted performance over various\nperiods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating\nrepresents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is\nthe worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of\nindustrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar\nrating is derived from a weighted average of the\nperformance associated with a fund’s three-, five\nand ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating\nmetrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star\nratings are provided at the individual share class\nlevel. The Nomura “star rating” is based on\nthree-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds\nwith fewer than three years of history are not\nrated and hence excluded from these rankings. All\nratings, the assigned peer categories and the\nasset values used to derive these rankings are\nsourced from the applicable fund rating provider.\nWhere applicable, the fund rating providers\nredenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at\na “primary share class” level to represent the\nstar rating of all other funds, except for Japan,\nfor which Nomura provides ratings at the fund\nlevel. The performance data may have been\ndifferent if all share classes had been included.\nPast performance is not indicative of future\nresults.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF\nassets under management in funds ranked in the 1st\nor 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):\nAll quartile rankings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive\nthese rankings are sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based on the\nnet-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on fund performance and associated\npeer rankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class”\nlevel to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds.

The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa\nB shares and proceeds from an insurance settlement. Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion,\npredominantly driven by: • the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, • $1.0 billion associated with First Republic,\npredominantly driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as expenses recorded in the second quarter of\n2023 with respect to individuals associated with First Republic who did not become employees of the Firm until July\n2, 2023, • a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements\nthat are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, • higher legal expenses, and • higher costs associated with the Firm's\ninternational consumer growth initiatives, partially offset by • lower benefits-related and real estate expenses.\nThe net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that was\ntransferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on\nthe investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.\n84    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe provision for credit losses was $171 million,\nreflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses related to a single name exposure, which was\nsubsequently charged off upon the restructuring of a\nloan. The current period income tax benefit was driven\nby: • the finalization of certain income tax\nregulations, other tax adjustments and tax benefits\nassociated with tax audit settlements, partially\noffset by • the impact from changes in the level and\nmix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,\nstate and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's\ntax reserves. The income taxes associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition are reflected in the\nestimated bargain purchase gain. The prior period\nincome tax benefit was driven by benefits related to\ntax audit settlements as well as other tax\nadjustments, partially offset by a change in the level\nand mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes that also impacted the\nFirm's tax reserves.

Treasury and CIO overview Treasury and\nCIO is predominantly responsible for measuring,\nmonitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s\nliquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by\nTreasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken\nby the Firm’s four major reportable business segments\nto serve their respective client bases, which generate\nboth on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.\nTreasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-\nliability management objectives generally by investing\nin high-quality securities that are managed for the\nlonger-term as part of the Firm’s investment\nsecurities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses\nderivatives to meet the Firm ’ s asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further\ninformation on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and\nCIO manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through\ndeposits at central banks and investments in short-\nterm instruments.

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its business, and the associated risks, in a\nmanner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data\nand management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;\nand\nA Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal governance\nand independent oversight by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm’s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited\nto, the economic environment, regulatory or government\npolicy, competitor or market evolution, business\ndecisions, process or judgment error, deliberate\nwrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural\ndisasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest\nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized\nin the following four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity, or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal\nor a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk,\nand investment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nrisk includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct,\nlegal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings\nand capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to\nthe Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers,\nand regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s\nChief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and approval\nof the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the\nFirmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk\nOfficers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and\nthe Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in\nturn, establish Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance\npolicies and standards, and define and oversee the\nimplementation of the Firm’s risk governance\nframework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in\ntheir LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks\nthat span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as\nfunctions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving\nrise to risk is expected to operate within the\nparameters identified by the IRM function, and within\nthe risk and control standards established by its own\nmanagement.\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management. The first line of\ndefense owns the identification of risks within their\nrespective organizations and the design and execution\nof controls to manage those risks. Responsibilities\nalso include adherence to applicable laws, rules and\nregulations and implementation of the risk\n86    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\ngovernance framework established by IRM, which may\ninclude policies, standards, limits, thresholds and\ncontrols.\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which\nis separate from the first line of defense and is\nresponsible for independently measuring risk, as well\nas assessing and challenging the risk management\npractices of the first line of defense. IRM is also\nresponsible for the identification of risks within its\nrespective organization, adherence to applicable laws,\nrules and regulations and for the development and\nimplementation of policies and standards with respect\nto its own processes.\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an\nindependent function that provides objective\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of\nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk\nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is headed by\nthe General Auditor, who reports to the Audit\nCommittee and administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute\nto the Firmwide control environment but are not\nconsidered part of a particular line of defense,\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These\nother functions are responsible for the identification\nof risks within their respective organizations,\nadherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations\nand implementation of the risk governance framework\nestablished by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks\nwithin their respective organizations, as well as the\ndesign and execution of controls, including IRM-\nspecified controls, to manage those risks. To support\nthis activity, the Firm has a risk identification\nframework designed to facilitate each LOB and\nCorporate’s responsibility to identify material risks\ninherent to the Firm’s businesses and operational\nactivities, catalog them in a central repository and\nreview material risks on a regular basis. The IRM\nfunction reviews and challenges the LOB and\nCorporate’s identified risks, maintains the central\nrepository and provides the consolidated Firmwide\nresults to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by\n“Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and\nqualitative risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is\nperiodically set and approved by senior management\n(including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board\nRisk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are\nassessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to\ntake risk consistent with its stated risk appetite.\nRisk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    87\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is\nsupported by a risk governance and oversight structure\nthat provides channels for the escalation of risks and\nissues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of\nDirectors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the principal standing\ncommittees of the Board of Directors and key senior\nmanagement-level committees in the Firm’s risk\ngovernance and oversight structure. In addition, there\nare other committees, forums and channels of\nescalation that support the oversight of risk that are\nnot shown in the chart below or described in this Form\n10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the\nFirm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),\nGeneral Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior\nexecutives, is accountable to and may refer matters to\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee\nand certain other members of senior management are\nresponsible for escalating to the Board the\ninformation necessary to facilitate the Board’s\nexercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm. This includes\nmonitoring the Firm’s financial performance and\ncondition and reviewing the strategic objectives and\nplans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant\nportion of its oversight responsibilities through its\nprincipal standing committees, each of which consists\nsolely of independent members of the Board. The Board\nRisk Committee is the principal committee that\noversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees\nthe control environment, and the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee oversees compensation\nand other management-related matters. Each committee\nof the Board oversees reputation risks, conduct risks,\nand environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\nmatters within its scope of responsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is\nresponsible for the oversight of management of the\nbank, which it discharges both acting directly and\nthrough the principal standing committees of the\nFirm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight\non behalf of JPMorgan\nChase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the\nBoard Risk Committee and the Audit Committee,\nrespectively, and, with respect to compensation and\nother management-related matters, the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its\noversight of management’s responsibility to implement\na global risk management framework reasonably designed\nto identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The\nBoard Risk Committee’s responsibilities include\napproval of applicable primary risk policies and\nreview of certain associated frameworks, analysis and\nreporting established by management. Breaches in risk\nappetite and parameters, issues that may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Firm, including capital\nand liquidity issues, and other significant risk-\nrelated matters are escalated to the Board Risk\nCommittee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight\nof management’s responsibility to ensure that there is\nan effective system of controls reasonably designed to\nsafeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the\nintegrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and\nmaintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and with laws, rules\nand regulations. It also assists the Board in its\noversight of the qualifications, independence and\nperformance of the Firm’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, and of the performance of the\nFirm’s Internal Audit function.\n88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee\n(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the\nFirm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC\nreviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and\nqualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the\nperformance of Operating Committee members against\ntheir goals, and approves their compensation awards.\nIn addition, the CEO’s award is subject to\nratification by the independent directors of the\nBoard. The CMDC also reviews the development of and\nsuccession for key executives. As part of the Board’s\nrole of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating\nthe “tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s\nculture, including reviewing updates from management\nregarding significant conduct issues and any related\nactions with respect to employees, including\ncompensation actions. The Public Responsibility\nCommittee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions\nand practices on public responsibility matters such as\ncommunity investment, fair lending, sustainability,\nconsumer practices and other public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm's values and character and could\nimpact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders.\nThe Committee also provides guidance on these matters\nto management and the Board, as appropriate. The\nCorporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises\ngeneral oversight with respect to the governance of\nthe Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications\nof and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for\nelection to the Board. The Committee evaluates and\nrecommends to the Board corporate governance practices\napplicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework\nfor assessing the Board’s performance and self-\nevaluation. Management oversight The Firm’s senior\nmanagement-level committees that are primarily\nresponsible for key risk-related functions include:\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s\nhighest management-level risk committee. It oversees\nthe risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides\na forum for discussion of topics and issues that are\nraised or escalated by its members and other\ncommittees. The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is\nan escalation committee for senior management to\nreview and discuss the Firmwide compliance and\noperational risk environment including identified\nissues, compliance and operational risk metrics and\nsignificant events that have been escalated. Line of\nBusiness and Regional Risk Committees are responsible\nfor overseeing the governance, limits, and controls\nthat have been established within the scope of their\nrespective activities. These committees review the\nways in which the particular LOB or the businesses\noperating in a particular region could be exposed to\nadverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying,\naccepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of\nmatters brought to these committees.\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the risk and control environment\nof their respective business or function, inclusive of\nOperational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As\npart of that mandate, they are responsible for\nreviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and\nother data that may impact the level of compliance and\noperational risk in a business or function, addressing\nkey compliance and operational risk issues , with an\nemphasis on processes with control concerns and\noverseeing control remediation. The Asset and\nLiability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for\noverseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management\n(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks\nsupporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity\nrisk, interest rate risk, and capital risk. The\nFirmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities conducted across the\nFirm. Risk governance and oversight functions The Firm\nmanages its risk through risk governance and oversight\nfunctions. The scope of a particular function or\nbusiness activity may include one or more drivers,\ntypes and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country\nRisk Management oversees country risk which may be a\ndriver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that\ncould give rise to multiple risk types such as credit\nor market risk. The following sections discuss the\nrisk governance and oversight functions that have been\nestablished to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s\nbusiness activities.\nRisk governance and oversight functions       Page\nStrategic Risk                                  90\nCapital Risk                                91-101\nLiquidity Risk                             102-109\nReputation Risk                                110\nConsumer Credit Risk                       114-119\nWholesale Credit Risk                      120-130\nInvestment Portfolio Risk                      134\nMarket Risk                                135-143\nCountry Risk                               144-145\nClimate Risk                                   146\nOperational Risk                           147-150\nCompliance Risk                                151\nConduct Risk                                   152\nLegal Risk                                     153\nEstimations and Model Risk                     154\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    89\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nSTRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nManagement and oversight\nThe Operating Committee, together with the senior\nleadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible\nfor managing the Firm’s most significant strategic\nrisks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business\ndiscussions and decision-making, including\nparticipation in relevant business reviews and senior\nmanagement meetings, risk and control committees and\nother relevant governance forums, and review of\nacquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board\nof Directors oversees management’s strategic\ndecisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM\nand the Firm’s risk governance framework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and\nstrategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement identify the associated risks that are\nincorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification\nframework and their impact on risk appetite.\nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of\nthe LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess\ntheir impact on the risk profile of the Firm.\nThe Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes\nthe development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other\nstrategic initiatives, is one component of managing\nthe Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines\nthe Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and\nincludes components such as budget, risk appetite,\ncapital, earnings and asset-liability management\nobjectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles,\nthe Operating Committee and senior management teams in\neach LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic\nplan periodically, including evaluating the strategic\nframework and performance against prior-year\ninitiatives, assessing the operating environment,\nrefining existing strategies and developing new\nstrategies.\nThe Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s\nassessment, are provided to the Board as part of its\nreview and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and\nthe plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.\nThe Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on\nrisk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust\nliquidity, is also a component in the management of\nstrategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101 for further information on capital risk.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109\nfor further information on liquidity risk. Refer to\nReputation Risk Management on page 110 for further\ninformation on reputation risk.\n90    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCapital risk is the risk that the Firm has an\ninsufficient level or composition of capital to\nsupport the Firm’s business activities and associated\nrisks during normal economic environments and under\nstressed conditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s\nbusiness strategy and competitive position.\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through\neconomic volatility is a strategic imperative of the\nFirm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating\nCommittee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet”\nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong\ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk\nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-term\nstability to enable the Firm to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly\nstressed environments. Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm’s capital prior to making\nsignificant decisions that could impact future\nbusiness activities. In addition to considering the\nFirm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates\nall sources and uses of capital with a view to\nensuring the Firm’s capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose\nprimary objective is to provide independent oversight\nof capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital\nrisk limits and indicators, including capital risk\nappetite;\nDeveloping processes to classify, monitor and report\ncapital limit breaches;\nPerforming assessments of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement activities, including changes made to the\nContingency Capital Plan described below; and\nConducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory\ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance with\napplicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital\nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to\nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through\nnormal economic cycles and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future\ninvestment opportunities;\nPromote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a\nsource of strength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its principal\ninsured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nat all times under applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate\nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with the\nFirm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements\nand maintaining a strong capital governance framework.\nThe internal minimum capital levels consider the\nFirm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an\ninternal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal\neconomic cycles and in stress events;\nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range\nof potential events; and\nRegularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and\nfollowing prescribed escalation protocols, both at the\nFirm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\ncapital management include the Capital Governance\nCommittee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional\nALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”)\nRisk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk\ntolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages\n86–89 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO\nand other risk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank\nHolding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually a\ncapital plan that has been reviewed and approved by\nthe Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and\nother stress testing processes to assess whether large\nBHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during\nperiods of economic and financial stress, and have\nrobust, forward-looking capital assessment and\nplanning processes in place that address each BHC’s\nunique risks to enable it to absorb losses under\ncertain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal\nReserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and\ninternal capital adequacy assessment processes\n(“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital\ndistributions, such as dividend payments or stock\nrepurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under\nthe severely adverse scenario from its supervisory\nstress test to determine each firm’s Stress Capital\nBuffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year.\nThe Firm's current SCB requirement is 2.9%, and will\nremain in effect until September 30, 2024. The Firm’s\nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including\nregulatory buffers, was 11.4% as of December 31, 2023.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on\nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    91\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs\nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of\nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses\nof capital as well as compliance with supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing\nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving\nthe capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and\nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined\ncentrally and applied uniformly across the businesses.\nThese scenarios are articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of\nbusiness results; global market shocks, which generate\nshort-term but severe trading losses; and\nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios\nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition\nto CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management\nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and\nsensitivity analyses, as necessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s\napproach towards capital management in normal economic\nconditions and in stressed environments. The\nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm\ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing\nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and\nsets out the capital contingency actions that are\nexpected to be taken or considered at various levels\nof capital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as\na consolidated financial holding company. The Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes\nsimilar minimum capital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally\nfollow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as\namended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards\nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and\nbanks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that\nmust be held by BHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to\nrisk. Under the rules currently in effect, two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for\ncalculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III\nStandardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III\nAdvanced”).\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the\nlower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements.\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule:\nAmendments applicable to large banking organizations\nand to banking organizations with significant trading\nactivity,\" which is referred to in this Form 10-K as\n“U.S. Basel III proposal”. Under the proposal, changes\nto the framework would include replacement of the\nAdvanced approach with an expanded risk-based\napproach, which would not permit the use of internal\nmodels for the calculation of RWA, other than for\nmarket risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer\nrequirement would be applicable to both the expanded\nrisk-based approach and the Standardized approach. The\nproposal would significantly revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion\nor more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The\nproposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-\nyear transition period applicable to the expanded\nrisk-based approach. Based on the Firm's understanding\nof the proposal, as applied to its Consolidated\nbalance sheets as of June 30, 2023 (the reference date\nfor a special data collection exercise conducted by\nthe Federal Reserve), the estimated impact at the end\nof the transition period would increase RWA by\napproximately 30%, which would result in an\napproximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary\nto meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else\nequal. These estimates do not reflect any actions that\nthe Firm may take to mitigate the impact of the rule\nas currently proposed.\nPending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to\nbuild capital above the current levels, and therefore\nthe CET1 target of 13.5% previously set by the Firm\n(which was with respect to the current Standardized\nRWA measure) is no longer meaningful. The Firm's\nquarterly capital ratios will vary dependent on market\nconditions and other factors. Under the requirements\nof the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new expanded risk-\nbased approach, when fully phased-in, would be the\nFirm’s binding constraint.\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital\nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and\nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III\nAdvanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-\nsensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of\ninternal credit models and parameters, whereas for\nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally\nbased on supervisory risk-weightings which vary\nprimarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market\nrisk RWA is generally calculated consistently between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In\naddition to the RWA calculated under these approaches,\nthe Firm may supplement such amounts to\n92    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nincorporate management judgment and feedback from its\nregulators.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Advanced Total Capital\nratio became the most binding constraint for the\nFirm’s Basel III risk-based ratios, primarily\nreflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer\nrequirement. However, as of December 31, 2023, with\nrespect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the\nStandardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced\nratios.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\nto calculate its SLR. As of the fourth quarter of\n2023, the Firm’s SLR became more binding than the\nBasel III risk-based ratios, primarily reflecting the\nreduction in the Stress Capital Buffer requirement.\nWith the increase in the GSIB surcharge in the first\nquarter of 2024, the Firm expects the risk-based\nratios to revert to being more binding than the SLR.\nRefer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB\nsurcharge and page 98 for additional information on\nSLR.\nOther Key Regulatory Developments\nGSIB Surcharge\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments\nwould require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on\nan annual basis, using the average of the quarterly\nsurcharge calculations throughout the calendar year,\nwith daily averaging required for certain measures\nwithin the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments\nwould be reduced from 50 bps to 10 bps and there would\nalso be other technical amendments to the Method 2\ncalculation. The proposed amendments would revise\nrisk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other\nU.S. GSIBs, and would become effective two calendar\nquarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer\nto Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages\n94-95 for further information on the GSIB surcharge.\nTLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the\nOCC released a proposal to expand the eligible long-\nterm debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean holding company\nrequirements under the existing total loss-absorbing\ncapacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with\n$100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.\nWhile U.S. GSIBs are already subject to these\nrequirements, the proposal would reduce the amount of\nLTD with remaining maturities of less than two years\nthat count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC requirement. The\nproposal would also expand the existing capital\ndeduction framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include\nLTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD\nrequirements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    93\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1\ncapital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are\nrequired to hold additional levels of capital to serve\nas a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital\nconservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a\ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a\nfixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced\nregulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable\nSCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized\nregulatory capital requirements.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject\nto the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB\nsurcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s\nassessment methodology, and is calculated by the\nFinancial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five\ncriteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.\n“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the\nMethod 1 requirements to include a measure of short-\nterm wholesale funding in place of substitutability,\nand introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.\n94    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB\nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\nand 2022.\n2024         2023         2022\nMethod 1    2.5     %    2.5     %    2.0     %\nMethod 2    4.5     %    4.0     %    3.5     %\nOn November 27, 2023, the FSB released its annual list of GSIBs based upon data as of December 31, 2022, which\naffirmed the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2025, unless the Firm’s\nMethod 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2023. The Firm’s\nMethod 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5% (up from 4.0%), which became effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%.\nAccordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge increased to 4.5% on\nJanuary 1, 2024. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally\nactive banks function. As of December 31, 2023, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal\nReserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve,\nFDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional\n2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in\nexcess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB\nsurcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may\ndistribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for\ncertain executive officers. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB\ntop-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer\nto TLAC on page 100 for additional information.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to the\nBasel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1\ncapital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by\ntaking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital,\nand adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory capital rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for\nadditional information. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result\nin limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share\nrepurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive officers. Other regulatory capital In\naddition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized”\nunder the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC\nImprovement Act, respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. Additional information regarding the\nFirm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is\npresented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on\nthe Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s current capital measures.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    95\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nSelected capital and RWA data\nThe following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

Refer to Firmwide Risk\nManagement on pages 86–89 for further discussion of\nALCO and other risk-related committees.\nInternal stress testing\nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing\nthat is intended to ensure that the Firm and its\nmaterial legal entities have sufficient liquidity\nunder a variety of adverse scenarios, including\nscenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution\nand recovery planning. Internal stress tests are\nproduced on a regular basis, and other stress tests\nare performed in response to specific market events or\nconcerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the\nFirm’s contractual financial obligations are met and\ntake into consideration:\nVarying levels of access to unsecured and secured\nfunding markets;\nEstimated non-contractual and contingent cash\noutflows;\nCredit rating downgrades;\nCollateral haircuts; and\nPotential impediments to the availability and\ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and\nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or\nother restrictions.\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time\nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both\nmarket and idiosyncratic stresses.\nResults of stress tests are considered in the\nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment\nof its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as\na source of funding for the Firm through equity and\nlong-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding\ncompany, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”),\nprovides funding to support the ongoing operations of\nthe Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm\nmaintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC,\nand operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to\ncomply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum\nliquidity requirements, and to manage through\n102    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nperiods of stress when access to normal funding\nsources may be disrupted. Contingency funding plan The\nFirm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the\nstrategies for addressing and managing liquidity\nresource needs during a liquidity stress event and\nincorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and\nrisk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the\nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires\nthat the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain\nan amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet\ntheir respective estimated total net cash outflows\nover a prospective 30 calendar-day period of\nsignificant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered\nHQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations\nas defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-\nbank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows\nare based on standardized stress outflow and inflow\nrates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds,\nand obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum\nof 100%.\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months\nended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 based on the Firm’s interpretation\nof the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                    Three months ended                                  December 31,\n(in millions)                      December 31, 2023        September 30, 2023                2022\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)               $             485,263     $             402,663     $       542,847\nEligible securities(b)(c)                    313,365                   378,702             190,201\nTotal HQLA(d)                  $             798,628     $             781,365     $       733,048\nNet cash outflows              $             704,857     $             696,668     $       652,580\nLCR                                              113  %                    112  %              112  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              93,771     $              84,697     $        80,468\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR                                              129  %                    123  %              151  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA       $             215,190     $             167,096     $       356,733\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

(d) Excludes\naverage excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR increased\nduring the three months ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared with the three months ended September 30,\n2023, driven by CIB market activities, partially\noffset by loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s\naverage LCR for the three months ended December 31,\n2023 decreased compared with the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in\ncash due to a decline in average deposits and loan\ngrowth, as well as the impact of First Republic and\nlower market values of HQLA-eligible investment\nsecurities. These impacts were partially offset by CIB\nmarkets activities. Refer to Note 10 and Note 34 for\nadditional information on the Firm's investment\nsecurities portfolio and the First Republic\nacquisition.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    103\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nActions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor\nbehavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide\ndeposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR\nmay fluctuate from period to period due to changes in\ntheir respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash\noutflows as a result of ongoing business activity and\nfrom the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions\nas well as other factors. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR\nDisclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s\nwebsite, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.\nLiquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be\navailable to raise liquidity. This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $649\nbillion and $694 billion as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity\nthat could be raised at any particular time would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The\ndecrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by\na reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an\nincrease in unencumbered AFS securities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had\napproximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and\nsecurities comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA,\nexcluding the impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0\nbillion and $735.5 billion, respectively, and\nunencumbered marketable securities with a fair value\nof approximately $649 billion and $694 billion,\nrespectively.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of\ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of\napproximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This\nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and\nsecurities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or\nother unencumbered securities that are currently\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window\nand other central banks. Available borrowing capacity\nincreased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to a\nhigher amount of wholesale loans pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm\ndoes not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Banks discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required”\namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with\nthe 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s\ninterpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's\nU.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023\nand September 30, 2023 on the Firm’s website for\nadditional information.\n104    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including stable deposits,\nsecured and unsecured funding in the capital markets\nand stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary\nfunding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access\nfunding through short- or long-term secured\nborrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term\ndebt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-\nbank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term\nunsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings\nwhich are primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on\noff–balance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                2023                2022         Average  2023                2022\nConsumer & Community           $  1,094,738        $  1,131,611          $  1,126,552        $  1,162,680\nBanking\nCorporate & Investment Bank         777,638             689,893               728,537             739,700\nCommercial Banking                  273,254             271,342               267,758             294,180\nAsset & Wealth Management           233,232             233,130               216,178             261,489\nCorporate                            21,826              14,203                20,042               9,866\nTotal Firm                     $  2,400,688        $  2,340,179          $  2,359,067        $  2,467,915\nThe Firm believes that deposits provide a stable\nsource of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. A significant portion\nof the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are both\nconsidered to be stable sources of liquidity.\nWholesale operating deposits are generally considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends than\nperiod-end deposit balances. However, during periods\nof market disruption, average deposit trends may be\nimpacted.\nAverage deposits were lower for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December\n31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of:\nlower balances in AWM due to continued migration\ninto higher-yielding investments driven by the higher\ninterest rate environment, partially offset by growth\nfrom new and existing customers as a result of new\nproduct offerings and the impact of First Republic,\na decline in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending, largely offset by the impact of First\nRepublic,\na decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition\nas clients seek higher-yielding investments, partially\noffset by the retention of inflows associated with\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023,\na decline in CIB due to deposit attrition, including\nactions taken to reduce certain deposits,\npredominantly offset by\nnet issuances of structured notes as a result of\nclient demand, and\ngrowth in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives.\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31, 2022,\nreflecting the net impact of:\nhigher balances in CIB due to net issuances of\nstructured notes as a result of client demand, as well\nas deposit inflows from client-driven activities in\nPayments and Securities Services, partially offset by\ndeposit attrition, including actions taken to reduce\ncertain deposits,\ngrowth in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives,\nlower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending,\na decline in AWM due to continued migration into\nhigher-yielding investments driven by the higher\ninterest rate environment, predominantly offset by\ngrowth from new and existing customers as a result of\nnew product offerings, and\na decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition\nas clients seek higher-yielding investments,\npredominantly offset by the retention of inflows\nassociated with disruptions in the market in the first\nquarter of 2023.\nThe net increase also included $61 billion of deposits\nassociated with First Republic, primarily reflected in\nCCB, AWM and CB.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    105\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRefer to Business Segment Results on pages 65–85 and\nNote 34 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.

Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation on structured notes. Certain deposits are\ncovered by insurance protection that provides\nadditional funding stability and results in a benefit\nto the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be\navailable to depositors in the countries in which the\ndeposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit\ninsurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.\ndepository institution. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were\n$1,331.9 billion and $1,383.7 billion, respectively,\nprimarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits.

Refer to Note 34 for additional information.\nShort-term funding\nThe Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding\nprimarily consist of securities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase. These instruments are\nsecured predominantly by high-quality securities\ncollateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.\nGSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at December 31,\n2023, compared with December 31, 2022, reflecting the\nimpact of a lower level of netting on reduced\nrepurchase activity.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds.\nThe increase in period-end commercial paper and the\ndecrease in average balances for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the respective prior\nyear periods were due to changes in net issuance\nlevels primarily for short-term liquidity management.\nThe decrease in average secured other borrowed funds\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the\nprior year period was primarily due to lower financing\nof Markets activities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    107\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nLong-term funding and issuance\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,\nincluding TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and\noptimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal\nlong-term funding plan.\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to\nprovide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company\nadvances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in period-end structured notes compared to the\nprior year period was attributable to net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an\nincrease in fair value.\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.\nLong-term unsecured\nfunding\nYear ended December 31,                         2023             2022                     2023             2022\n(Notional in millions)          Parent Company                              Subsidiaries\nIssuance\nSenior notes issued in       $          14,256        $  32,600          $         3,750        $       —\nthe U.S. market\nSenior notes issued in                   2,141            2,752                        —                —\nnon-U.S. markets\nTotal senior notes                      16,397           35,352                    3,750                —\nSubordinated debt                            —            3,500                        —                —\nStructured notes(a)                      3,013            2,535                   35,281           35,577\nTotal long-term unsecured\nfunding –                    $          19,410        $  41,387          $        39,031        $  35,577\nissuance\nMaturities/redemptions\nSenior notes                 $          21,483        $  16,700          $            67        $      65\nSubordinated debt                        2,090                —                        —                —\nStructured notes                         1,532            1,594                   28,777           25,481\nTotal long-term unsecured\nfunding –                    $          25,105        $  18,294          $        28,844        $  25,546\nmaturities/redemptions\n(a) Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.\nThe Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB\nadvances.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its\nliquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm\nbelieves that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings.

These events could contribute to\nfinancial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement\nactions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well\nas other harm to the Firm.\nOrganization and management\nReputation Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that establishes the governance\nframework for managing reputation risk across the\nFirm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is\ninherently challenging to identify, manage, and\nquantify.\nThe Firm’s reputation risk management function\nincludes the following activities:\nMaintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance\npolicy and a standard consistent with the reputation\nrisk framework\nProviding oversight of the governance framework\nthrough processes and infrastructure to support\nconsistent identification, escalation and monitoring\nof reputation risk issues Firmwide\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the\nprinciples for managing reputation risk for the Firm.\nIt is the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate and\nemployees to consider the reputation of the Firm when\ndeciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a\ntransaction or client relationship, enter a new\njurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider\nany other activity. Environmental impacts and social\nconcerns are increasingly important considerations in\nassessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a\ncomponent of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.\n110    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with\nthe default or change in credit profile of a client,\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a\nreduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk,\nand investment portfolio risk.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of\nclients and customers, ranging from large corporate\nand institutional clients to individual consumers and\nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm\nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home\nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with\nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through\nits operating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages\ncredit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk\nmanagement governance includes the following\nactivities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including transaction\nand exposure approval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting\nguidelines\nAssigning and managing credit approval authorities\nin connection with the approval of credit exposure\nManaging criticized exposures and delinquent loans,\nand\nEstimating credit losses and supporting appropriate\ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor\nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring\ncredit risk vary depending on several factors,\nincluding type of asset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g.,\ndelinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk management and\ncollection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of\nan obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm\nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses\nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and\nthe allowance for investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and\nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on\npages 155–158 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital\nand represent the potential volatility of actual\nlosses relative to the established allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The analyses\nfor these losses include stress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined\ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic\nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress\ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional\nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry\nand country- specific stress scenarios, as\nappropriate. The Firm uses stress testing to inform\ndecisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and\nLOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress\non individual counterparties.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    111\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of\nthe approval and decision-making process for extending\ncredit so that credit risks are assessed accurately,\napproved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval\nauthorities, concentration limits, risk-rating\nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In\naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used\nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and\nother trends, including any concentrations at the\nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be\naddressed through changes in underwriting policies and\nportfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends against\nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and trends are\nincorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer\ncredit losses and are part of the monitoring of the\ncredit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client\nand counterparty level with established concentration\nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as\ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure\nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval processes\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent\nCredit Review function is responsible for:\nI ndependently assessing risk grades assigned to\nexposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio and\nthe timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by\nresponsible business units; and\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper\nmonitoring and management of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading policies and\nunderwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio\nreporting of industry, clients, counterparties and\ncustomers, product and geography are prepared, and the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly\nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance\nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are\nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk\ncommittees, senior management and the Board of\nDirectors.\n112    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

Refer to Consumer Credit\nPortfolio on pages 114–119 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer\nloans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 120–130 and Note 12 for further discussions of the wholesale\ncredit environment and wholesale loans. On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting\nguidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess\nwhether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure of\nloan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest\nrate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The\nFirm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the\nelimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession,\nthe population of loans considered FDMs differs from the population previously considered TDRs.

Refer to Note 12\nfor further information about this portfolio,\nincluding information about delinquencies, loan\nmodifications and other credit quality indicators.\nResidential real estate: The residential real estate\nportfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage\nloans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans\nincreased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by\nresidential real estate loans associated with First\nRepublic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared\nto December 31, 2022 predominantly driven by loan\nsales, partially offset by the net impact of paydowns\nand additions, including those associated with First\nRepublic. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the prior year driven by\nlower prepayments due to higher interest rates. Loans\nat fair value increased from December 31, 2022, driven\nby an increase in Home Lending as originations\noutpaced warehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases\noutpaced sales and paydowns. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the carrying values of interest-only residential\nmortgage loans were $90.6 billion and $36.3 billion,\nrespectively. The increase was driven by First\nRepublic. These loans have an interest-only payment\nperiod generally followed by an adjustable-rate or\nfixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity\nand are typically originated as higher-balance loans\nto higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of\nthis portfolio is comparable with the performance of\nthe broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying\nvalue of home equity lines of credit outstanding was\n$16.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which included\n$2.6 billion associated with First Republic. The\ncarrying value of home equity lines of credit\noutstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that have\nrecast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments\nor have been modified and $4.3 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after\n2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their\nrevolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn\nline to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are\nexhibiting a material deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm\nmonitors its exposure to certain potential\nunrecoverable claim payments related to government-\ninsured loans and considers this exposure in\nestimating the allowance for loan losses.\n(in millions)                                December 31, 2023            December 31, 2022\nCurrent                              $  446                     $    659\n30-89 days past due                     102                          136\n90 or more days past due                182                          302\nTotal government guaranteed loans    $  730                     $  1,097\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-to-\nvalue ratio of residential real estate loans At\nDecember 31, 2023, $228.4 billion, or 70% of the total\nretained residential real estate loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas\nand Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or\n62% at December 31, 2022. Average current estimated\nloan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have improved, reflecting\nan increase in home prices. Refer to Note 12 for\ninformation on the geographic composition and current\nestimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate\nloans. Modified residential real estate loans For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 , residential real estate\nFDMs were $136 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm\nalso had $69 million of loans subject to trial\nmodification where the terms of the loans have not\nbeen permanently modified, as well as $9 million of\nloans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nproceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\"). The changes to the\nTDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably\nexpected and concession assessment criteria.\nAccordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans\nwere considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1\nand Note 12 for further information. For the year\nended December 31, 2022 , residential real estate TDRs\nwere $362 million.

The\nportfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022\ndue to originations of scored auto loans and an\nincrease in other consumer unsecured fair value option\nloans in CIB associated with First Republic, largely\noffset by paydowns. Net charge-offs for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year\ndue to higher charge-offs of scored auto loans driven\nby the decline in used vehicle valuations.

FDMs increased for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to credit card TDRs in the\nprior year, as delinquencies have normalized. In\naddition to FDMs, the Firm also had $27 million of\nloans subject to trial modification where the terms of\nthe loans have not been permanently modified for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The changes to the TDR\naccounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably\nexpected and concession assessment criteria.\nAccordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs,\nbut not FDMs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, credit card TDRs\nwere $418 million.\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information\nabout this portfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and\nmodifications.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    119\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating\nservices (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with\nbanks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client\nconcentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 122–125 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for\nwhich the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to\nconvert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic.\nAccordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in\nfuture periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 53 for additional information. As of December 31, 2023,\nretained loans increased $68.8 billion predominantly driven by the impact of First Republic. Lending-related\ncommitments increased $64.8 billion, driven by the impact of First Republic, and net portfolio activity in CIB and\nCB. As of December 31, 2023, nonperforming exposure increased $476 million predominantly driven by nonperforming\nretained loans in Real Estate and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and Individuals largely driven by the impact\nof First Republic, partially offset by a single name upgrade in Civic Organizations. For the year ended December\n31, 2023, wholesale net charge-offs increased $698 million, predominantly driven by the restructuring of a loan,\nincreases in Real Estate (concentrated in Office) and Consumer & Retail.\nWholesale\ncredit\nportfolio\nDecember 31,\n(in                            Credit\nmillions)     2023           exposure            2022                2023     Nonperforming  2022\nLoans               $         672,472                  $    603,670        $          2,346        $  1,963\nretained\nLoans                           3,498                         3,352                      89              26\nheld-for-sa…\nLoans at                       26,520                        32,075                     279             406\nfair value\nLoans                         702,490                       639,097                   2,714           2,395\nDerivative                     54,864                        70,880                     364             296\nreceivables\nReceivables\nfrom                           47,625                        49,257                       —               —\ncustomers(a)\nTotal\nwholesale                     804,979                       759,234                   3,078           2,691\ncredit-rela…\nassets\nAssets\nacquired in\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nReal estate                            NA                            NA                 154              74\nowned\nOther                                  NA                            NA                   —               —\nTotalassets\nacquired in                            NA                            NA                 154              74\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nLending-rel…                  536,786                       471,980                     464             455\ncommitments\nTotal\nwholesale           $       1,341,765        -c        $  1,231,214        $          3,696        $  3,220\ncredit\nportfolio\nCredit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-rela…\nnotes used          $         -36,989                  $    -18,143        $              —        $      —\nin credit\nportfolio\nmanagement\nactivities(…\nLiquid\nsecurities\nand other\ncash                          -22,461                       -23,014                          NA              NA\ncollateral\nheld against\nderivatives\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB,\nCCB and AWM; these are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S.\nbanking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and\ndoubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.4\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.3% and 2.7% of\ntotal wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $41.4 billion, $38.3 billion was performing. The increase in\ncriticized exposure was predominantly driven by Real Estate, Technology, Media & Telecommunications (predominantly\nTechnology) and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The contractual amounts of these\nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible\ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these\ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations\nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently\nfail to perform according to the terms of these\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced, extended,\ncancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the Firm does not\nbelieve that the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm’s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for\nfurther information on wholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment\nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the\nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on\ndeposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors\nthe required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to\ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally\nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of\nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and\nthe Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s\nobligation to provide, additional margin when the fair\nvalue of the collateral declines. Because of these\nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not\nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses\nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\nbased on the value of the collateral and probability\nof borrower default. These receivables are reported\nwithin accrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s\naccounting policies for the allowance for credit\nlosses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange\nand equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs\nand uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to\nwhich the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the\nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),\nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also\nbe exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the\nFirm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures\narising from derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s\nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,\nwhich are not typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity and centrally\ncleared trades that are settled daily — was\napproximately 87% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRefer to Note 5 for additional information on the\nFirm’s use of collateral agreements and further\ndiscussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and\n$70.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The decrease was primarily as a result\nof market movements. Derivative receivables represent\nthe fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by the\nFirm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the\nFirm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition of\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits\nof these additional collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are subject to a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement and limited to the net amount\nof the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily\ncash, G7 government securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed securities, and\ncorporate debt and equity securities) delivered by\nclients at the initiation of transactions, as well as\ncollateral related to contracts that have a non-daily\ncall frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of the reporting\ndate. Although this collateral does not reduce the\nreceivables balances and is not included in the tables\nbelow, it is available as security against potential\nexposure that could arise should the fair value of the\nclient’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s\nfavor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on\nthe Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative\ntransactions.\n128    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative\nreceivables and the internal ratings profile for the\nperiods presented.\nDerivative receivables\nDecember 31, (in millions)                         2023              2022\nTotal, net of cash collateral          $   54,864        $   70,880\nLiquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative        -22,461           -23,014\nreceivables\nTotal, net of liquid securities and    $   32,403        $   47,866\nother cash collateral\nheld against derivative receivables          -993            -1,261\nTotal, net of collateral               $   31,410        $   46,605\nRatings profile\nof derivative\nreceivables\nDecember 31,                        2023                                            2022       % of exposure\n(in millions,            Exposure net of    % of exposure net            Exposure net of                 net\nexcept ratios)                collateral        of collateral                 collateral       of collateral\nInvestment-grade    $             24,004                   76  %    $             35,097                  75  %\nNoninvestment-g…                   7,406                   24                     11,508                  25\nTotal               $             31,410                  100  %    $             46,605                 100  %\nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure, the\nnet fair value of the derivative receivables does not\ncapture the potential future variability of that\ncredit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm\ncalculates, on a client-by-client basis, three\nmeasures of potential derivatives-related credit loss:\nPeak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average\nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level\nover the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used\nas an input for aggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value\nof the Firm’s derivative exposures, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG\nover the total life of the derivative contract is used\nas the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used\nto calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further\ndescribed below.\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in\nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the\ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In\naddition, the Firm’s risk management process for\nderivatives exposures takes into consideration the\npotential impact of wrong-way risk, which\nis broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a\ncounterparty is positively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty, which could\ncause exposure to increase at the same time as the\ncounterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and\nmagnitude of these correlations over time. To the\nextent that these correlations are identified, the\nFirm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular\ncounterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to\nchanges in CVA by entering into credit derivative\ncontracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity derivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s\ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years\nas calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The\nthree measures generally show that exposure will\ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    129\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-\nmaker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit\nportfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate\nthe credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management\nactivities”). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also\nuses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain\nsecurities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit\nportfolio management activities.\nCredit derivatives and credit-related notes used\nin credit portfolio management activities\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nCredit derivatives and credit-related notes used         Notional amount of protection\nto manage:                                                       purchased and sold(a)    2023             2022\nLoans and lending-related commitments                 $                         24,157          $   6,422\nDerivative receivables                                                          12,832             11,721\nCredit derivatives and credit-related\nnotes used in credit portfolio                        $                         36,989          $  18,143\nmanagement activities\n(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s\nnet protection purchased or sold with respect to each\nunderlying reference entity or index. The credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting under\nU.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair\nvalue, with gains and losses recognized in principal\ntransactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and\nlending-related commitments being risk-managed are\naccounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in\naccounting treatment, between loans and lending-\nrelated commitments and the credit derivatives used in\ncredit portfolio management activities, causes\nearnings volatility that is not representative, in the\nFirm’s view, of the true changes in value of the\nFirm’s overall credit exposure. The effectiveness of\ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the\nFirm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of\nfactors, including the named reference entity (i.e.,\nthe Firm may experience losses on specific exposures\nthat are different than the named reference entities\nin the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the\nCDS (which may have a defined credit event that does\nnot align with an actual loss realized by the Firm);\nand the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which\nin some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s\nexposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to\npurchase credit protection with a maturity date that\nis the same or similar to the maturity date of the\nexposure for which the protection was purchased, and\nremaining differences in maturity are actively\nmonitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit\nderivatives in Note 5 for further information on\ncredit derivatives and derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities.\n130    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm's financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm’s\nallowance for credit losses generally consists of:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is reflected in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023\nwas $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1\nbillion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses included $1.9 billion,\nconsisting of: • $1.3 billion in consumer ,\npredominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $1.4 billion\nin Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction\nof $200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in\nCard Services was driven by loan growth, including an\nincrease in revolving balances, partially offset by\nreduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in\nHome Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook\nfor home prices, and • $675 million in wholesale ,\ndriven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm’s weighted average macroeconomic\noutlook, including deterioration in the outlook for\ncommercial real estate in CB, and an addition for\ncertain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset\nby the impact of changes in the loan and lending-\nrelated commitment portfolios. The net addition also\nincluded $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for\nthe First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023. The changes\nin the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook\nalso included updates to the central scenario in the\nthird quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted\nunemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate\nin GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed\non the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023,\nreflecting elevated recession risks due to high\ninflation and tightening financial conditions. The\nallowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction\nof $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes\nto the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information.\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing a weighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios\nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than\nthe central case assumptions provided in the table\nbelow, resulting in a weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth\nquarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP\nlevel that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the\nend of the second quarter of 2025.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December 31,\n2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was\n$569.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages\n84–85 and Note 10 for further information on the\ninvestment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages\n102–109 for further information on related liquidity\nrisk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143\nfor further information on the market risk inherent in\nthe portfolio. Governance and oversight Investment\nsecurities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk\nAppetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk\nCommittee with regular updates provided to the Board\nRisk Committee. The Firm’s independent control\nfunctions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including capital\nand credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The Firm’s investments will continue to\nevolve based on market circumstances and in line with\nits strategic initiatives, including the Firm’s\nenvironmental and social goals. The table below\npresents the aggregate carrying values of the\nprincipal investment portfolios as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\n(in billions)                                       December 31, 2023             December 31, 2022\nTax-oriented investments, primarily in\nalternative energy and affordable          $  28.8                       $  26.2\nhousing(a)\nPrivate equity, various debt and equity       10.5                          10.8\ninstruments, and real assets\nTotal carrying value                       $  39.3                       $  37.0\n(a) As of December 31, 2023, included approximately\n$1.0 billion in tax-oriented investments in CIB\nassociated with First Republic. Governance and\noversight The Firm’s approach to managing principal\ninvestment risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk\ngovernance structure. The Firm has established a\nFirmwide risk policy framework for all principal\ninvesting activities that includes approval by\nexecutives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate. The Firm’s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investments\nin accordance with relevant policies. As part of the\nrisk governance structure, approved levels for\ninvestments are established and monitored for each\nrelevant business or segment in order to manage the\noverall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts\nstress testing on these portfolios using specific\nscenarios that estimate losses based on significant\nmarket moves and/or other risk events.\n134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of\nassets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies\nand procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for\nthe following functions:\nMaintaining a market risk policy framework\nIndependently measuring, monitoring and controlling\nLOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\nDefining, approving and monitoring limits\nPerforming stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and\ntherefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics,\nboth statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk\nincluding:\nValue-at-risk\nStress testing\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nEarnings-at-risk\nEconomic Value Sensitivity\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting limits,\nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration\nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity,\naccommodation of client business, and management\njudgment. Market Risk Management maintains different\nlevels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and\nstress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented\nby certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit\nand loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis.\nLimits that have not been reviewed within specified\ntime periods by Market Risk Management are reported to\nsenior management. The LOBs and Corporate are\nresponsible for adhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely\nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In the event of a\nbreach, Market Risk Management consults with senior\nmembers of appropriate groups within the Firm to\ndetermine the suitable course of action required to\nreturn the applicable positions to compliance, which\nmay include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the\nbreach or granting a temporary increase in limits to\naccommodate an expected increase in client activity\nand/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level\nlimit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur. For additional discussion on\nmodel uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 154.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    135\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions\nwhich give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous\n12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are representative\nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the\nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that\nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made\nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification\nacross product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results\nare reported as appropriate to various groups\nincluding senior management, the Board Risk Committee\nand regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market\nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product\ntypes. To capture material market risks as part of the\nFirm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses\nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR\nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk\nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as\nsensitivities and historical time series used to\ngenerate daily market values may be different across\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR\nmodel results across all portfolios are aggregated at\nthe Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time horizons, and\nother factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict\nlosses, particularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm\nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It\nis likely that using an actual price-based time series\nfor these products, if available, would affect the VaR\nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its\nmarket risk positions.\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market data\nused may be different than the independent third-party\ndata collected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data sources may\ndiffer. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for\nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 154 for information regarding model\nreviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR\nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory\nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital\nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently\nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an\nexpected tail loss methodology which approximates a\n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to\n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital\nrules, which may be different than the positions\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the\ndiversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm’s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other components\nof market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g.,\nVaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the\nrespective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    137\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and\nrisk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR\nfor each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(b) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio,\nwhich are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which\nis not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA\nrelated to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads\nfor those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This\nexposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded .\n(d) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market\nresulted in elevated maximum Credit Portfolio VaR, as well as maximum Total VaR.\n2023 compared with 2022\nAverage Total VaR decreased by $15 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 when compared with the\nprior year.\nThe decrease was driven by reduced market volatility\nand risk reductions predominantly impacting fixed\nincome, commodities and equities.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the four trailing quarters.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nFirst Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter\n2023             2023              2023             2023\n138    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which\ncompares the daily Risk Management VaR results with\nthe daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR\nbacktesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in\nthe chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported\nrevenue as they exclude certain components of total\nnet revenue, such as those associated with the\nexecution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-\ndriven trading and intraday risk management\nactivities), fees, commissions, other valuation\nadjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset\nthe backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under\nBasel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily\nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management\nVaR methodology, assuming current changes in market\nvalues are consistent with the historical changes used\nin the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading\ndays on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically\nexpected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during\nthe 12 months of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm\nposted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days, and\nobserved 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of which eight\nwere in the three months ended December 31, 2023.\nFirmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the\nloss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets\nrevenue, as the population of positions which comprise\neach metric are different and due to the exclusion of\ncertain components of total net revenue in backtesting\ngains and losses as described above.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of\nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December 31,\n2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management\nVaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point\nintervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within\nthe intervals that are greater than one hundred\npercent.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but\npossible economic and market scenarios. The results\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for\nthose potential losses and are measured against\nlimits.\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of\npotential stress for both market rallies and market\nsell-offs, assuming significant changes in market\nfactors such as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array\nof hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on\ntail events in specific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact multiple market\nfactors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate\nspecific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk\nbetween different products. The flexibility in the\nstress framework allows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible\nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are\nreported periodically to senior management of the\nFirm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk\nStress Methodology Committee reviews and approves\nchanges to stress testing methodology and scenarios\nacross the Firm. Significant changes to the framework\nare escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board\nof Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework,\nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance.\nA profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\nStructural interest rate risk management\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities which are included in\nVaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as\nwell as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments. Refer to the table\non page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nGovernance\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest\nrate risk management policy and related limits, which\nare subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee.\nTreasury and CIO, working in partnership with the\nLOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate\nrisk profile and reviews it with senior management,\nincluding the CTC Risk Committee. In addition,\noversight of structural interest rate risk is managed\nthrough a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC\nCRO. This risk function is responsible for providing\nindependent oversight and governance around\nassumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for\nstructural interest rate risk, including limits\nrelated to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value\nSensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate\nrisk generally through its investment securities\nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\nKey Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments\nas interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide\nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate\nrisk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer\npricing, which takes into account the elements of\ninterest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in\nfinancial markets. These elements include asset and\nliability balances and contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment schedules, expected\nprepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\nEarnings-at-Risk\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest\nrates and,\n140    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nin the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm\nconducts simulations of changes to this baseline for\ninterest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies\n(“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits\nwith banks, investment securities, long-term debt and\nany related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer\npricing of other positions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as described on page\n136 . These simulations exclude hedges of exposure\nfrom non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising\nfrom the Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of\nthe hedges in these simulations would increase U.S.\ndollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign\nexchange risk on page 145 for more information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income baseline over the\nfollowing 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by an\nequal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and increasing long-term\nrates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing\nshort-term rates and holding long-term rates constant\nor holding short-term rates constant and decreasing\nlong-term rates. These scenarios consider many\ndifferent factors, including: • The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous changes in\ninterest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted\nbalance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about\nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients\nand customers in response to instantaneous rate\nchanges. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on\nthe interest rates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience. Deposit\nforecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-\nat-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions\nrelating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that\nare highly uncertain and require management judgment.\nTherefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the\nFirm at any particular time could be impacted by\nactions the Federal Reserve may take as part of\nmonetary policy, including through the use of the\nReverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are\nother factors that impact the amount of deposits held\nat the Firm such as the level of loans across the\nindustry and competition for deposits. • The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,\nrepresent the amount by which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market interest rates.\nAs part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and\nperiodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk\ncalculations, the Firm updated its model in the second\nquarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags\nimpacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The\nmodel change incorporated observed pricing and\ncustomer behavior in both rising and falling interest\nrate environments. Actual deposit rates paid may\ndiffer from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to\ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits. The\nFirm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions\nused in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with\nrespect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit\nbalances, both of which are especially significant in\nthe case of consumer deposits. The results of these\nsensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk\nCommittee and the Board Risk Committee. The Firm’s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated\nand enhanced in response to changes in the composition\nof the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market\nconditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and\nother factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s\ninterest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis\ndoes not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net\ninterest income (Refer to Outlook on page 52 for\nadditional information) .

In accordance with the CTC\ninterest rate risk management policy, the Firm has\nestablished limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE.\nAdditional information on long-term debt and held to\nmaturity investment securities is disclosed on page\n195 in Note 2 financial instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n142    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNon-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\nNon-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or\nliabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital\ninvestments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of\nthe Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on\npage 66 for additional information.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to\nchanges in relevant market variables.

The Country Risk Management group actively\nmonitors the various portfolios which may be impacted\nby these developments and measures the extent to which\nthe Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s\nstrategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that assesses, manages and\nmonitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes\nthe following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards\nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks\nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and\nstress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting\ntrends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling\nmodels and ratings indicators, for early\nidentification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of\nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero\nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities\nwhich result in contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country exposure\nmeasure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not\nsuitable for attribution to an\nindividual country. The use of different measurement\napproaches or assumptions could affect the amount of\nreported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\nDeposits with banks are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central banks, commercial banks,\nand other financial institutions\nLending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their\nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral\nreceived\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair\nvalue of all positions, including both long and short\npositions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives exposure is measured at the net\nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for\nthe same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the\nfair value of the derivative receivable or payable,\nreflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these\nexposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims\nto estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements\nto a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management\nperiodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of\ncountries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and\ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as\nnecessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk\nManagement to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management\npurposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special\nAdministrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with\nwhich they are associated. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2023, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The top 20 country exposures\nrepresent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluct uate from period to\nperiod due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities\nundertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a\nreduction in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken\nby the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven by\na reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from\nchanges in interest rates. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $350\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.

Climate change is\nviewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing\ntypes of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is\ncategorized into physical risk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial\nloss associated with a changing climate. Acute\nphysical risk drivers include the increased frequency\nor severity of climate and weather events, such as\nfloods, wildfires and tropical cyclones. Chronic\nphysical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in\nthe climate, such as sea level rise, persistent\nchanges in precipitation levels and increases in\naverage ambient temperatures.\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic\nimplications associated with a societal adjustment to\na low-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include\npossible changes in public policy, adoption of new\ntechnologies and shifts in consumer preferences.\nTransition risks may also be influenced by changes in\nthe physical climate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that\nis responsible for establishing and maintaining the\nFirmwide framework and strategy for managing climate\nrisks that may impact the Firm. The Climate Risk\nManagement function engages across the Firm to help\nintegrate climate risk considerations into existing\nrisk management frameworks, as appropriate.\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\nSetting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across the\nFirm\nDeveloping metrics, scenarios and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of potential\nclimate-related financial and economic impacts to the\nFirm\nEstablishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy\nand the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of climate\nrisks present in their business activities and for\nadherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules\nand regulations.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating\nclimate risk management into existing governance\nframeworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as\nappropriate.\nThe LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are\nresponsible for providing the Board Risk Committee\nwith information on significant climate risks and\nclimate-related initiatives, as appropriate.\n146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nRisk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest\nitself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,\nbusiness disruptions (including those caused by\nextraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or\nfailure of vendors or other third party providers to\nperform in accordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of the\nFirm’s financial position, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and regulatory\nenvironments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk\n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable\nthe Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and\ntest, manage and report on the Firm’s operational\nrisk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management\nOrganization, which consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the\nday-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and\nFRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nis responsible for defining the CCOR Management\nFramework and establishing the minimum standards for\nits execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead\nOfficers report to the Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are\nindependent of the respective businesses or functions\nthey oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is\nincluded in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy\nthat is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their\nrespective control environment to assess circumstances\nin which controls have failed, and to determine where\nremediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s\nOperational Risk and Compliance organization\n(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight\nof and challenge to these evaluations and may also\nperform independent assessments of significant\noperational risk events and areas of concentrated or\nemerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the control\nenvironments and reporting the results to senior\nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses\noperational risks through quantitative means,\nincluding operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach\n(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the\nprojected frequency and severity of operational risk\nlosses based on historical data. The LDA model is used\nto estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a\none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level.\nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal operational\nrisk losses in the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after\nthe issues or business activities giving rise to the\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the\nFirm’s operational risk capital methodology, which\nuses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),\nincorporates internal and external losses as well as\nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of\nkey business environment and internal control metrics.\nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in\nits AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The\nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR\nand other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for\ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in connection\nwith their independent monitoring and testing\ncompliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules\nand regulations. Through monitoring and testing,\nOperational Risk and Compliance independently identify\nareas of heightened operational risk and tests the\neffectiveness of controls within the LOBs and\nCorporate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    147\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation of\naction plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational\nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate\nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed.\nOperational Risk and Compliance has established\nstandards designed to ensure that consistent\noperational risk reporting and operational risk\nreports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by\nthe LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the\nevaluation of key risk and performance indicators\nagainst established thresholds as well as the\nassessment of different types of operational risk\nagainst stated risk appetite. The standards establish\nescalation protocols to senior management and to the\nBoard of Directors.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm.\nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers\nand maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park\nAssurance Company. Insurance may also be required by\nthird parties with whom the Firm does business.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.\nOperational risk subcategories include Compliance\nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and\nModel risk. Refer to pages 151, 152, 153 and 154,\nrespectively for more information on Compliance,\nConduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of operational risks\nsuch as business and technology resiliency, payment\nfraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as\ncybersecurity, are provided below.\nWar in Ukraine and Sanctions\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial\nand economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and\nRussia-associated entities and individuals by various\ngovernments around the world, including the\nauthorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions\nare complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues\nto face increased operational and other risks\nassociated with addressing these complex compliance-\nrelated matters. To manage this increased risk, the\nFirm has implemented controls reasonably designed to\nmitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent\ndealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject\nto sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments\nas required by the applicable regulations.\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s\ncontrol such as the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, the\neffects of climate change, power or telecommunications\nloss, failure of a third party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks, civil or political unrest or\nterrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is\ndesigned to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to,\nwithstand and recover from business disruptions\nincluding occurrence of extraordinary events beyond\nits control that may impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets including staff,\ntechnology, facilities and third parties. The program\nincludes governance, awareness training, planning and\ntesting of recovery strategies, as well as strategic\nand tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and\nmanage business resiliency risks. The program is\nrequired to be managed in accordance with the Firm’s\noverall approach to Operational Risk Management,\nincluding alignment with technology, cybersecurity,\ndata, physical security, crisis management, real\nestate and outsourcing programs.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The Firm employs various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well as providing\nemployee and client education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers and other third parties to an\nappropriate standard of operational performance and to\nmitigate key risks, including data loss and business\ndisruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group\nis responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring,\nreporting and standards with respect to third-party\noutsourcing risks.\n148    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the\nunauthorized disclosure of data.\nOverview\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously\nevolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are\ndevoted to protecting and enhancing the security of\ncomputer systems, software, networks, storage devices,\nand other technology. The Firm’s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks that can result in unauthorized\naccess to confidential information, the destruction of\ndata, disruptions to or degradations of service, the\nsabotaging of systems or other damage.\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will\ncontinue to experience, a higher volume and complexity\nof cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened\ngeopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented\nmeasures and controls reasonably designed to address\nthis evolving environment, including enhanced threat\nmonitoring. In addition, the Firm continues to review\nand enhance its capabilities to address associated\nrisks, such as those relating to the management of\nadministrative access to systems.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business, that\nfacilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g.,\nvendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses,\ncentral depositories, and financial intermediaries) or\nthat the Firm has acquired are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party incidents\nsuch as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by\nthe employees of such parties, or cyber attacks,\nincluding ransomware and supply-chain compromises,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Firm,\nincluding in circumstances in which an affected third\nparty is unable to deliver a product or service to the\nFirm or where the incident delivers compromised\nsoftware to the Firm or results in lost or compromised\ninformation of the Firm or its clients or customers.\nClients and customers are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information\nassets, particularly when their activities and systems\nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control\nsystems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions with\nits clients, customers and other external parties\nconcerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities\nto improve cybersecurity.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, including any\nprevious cybersecurity events, have not materially\naffected the Firm or its business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the\ncomprehensive approach that the Firm takes to address\ncybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be successful in\npreventing or mitigating a future cybersecurity\nincident that could have a material adverse effect on\nthe Firm or its business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nOrganization and management\nThe Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”)\nreports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and\nis a member of key cybersecurity governance forums.\nThe CISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology\nControls organization, which is responsible for\nidentifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for\nimplementing and maintaining controls to manage\ncybersecurity threats. The CISO is responsible for the\nFirm’s Information Security Program, which is designed\nto prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks in\norder to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of the Firm's infrastructure,\nresources and information. The program includes\nmanaging the Firm’s global cybersecurity operations\ncenters, providing training, conducting cybersecurity\nevent simulation exercises, implementing the Firm’s\npolicies and standards relating to technology risk and\ncybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed,\nthe Firm’s cybersecurity capabilities.\nThe Firm’s Information Security Program includes the\nfollowing functions:\nCyber Operations , which is responsible for\nimplementing and maintaining controls designed to\ndetect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and\nincludes a dedicated function for incident response\nand ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and\nvulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s\nthird-party suppliers.\nTechnology Governance, Risk & Controls , which is\nresponsible for operationalizing technology risk and\ncontrol frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments\nthat may impact the Firm, and developing control\ncatalogs and assessments of controls, as well as\noverseeing governance and reporting of technology and\ncybersecurity risk.\nSecurity Awareness , which provides awareness and\ntraining that reinforces information risk and security\nmanagement practices and compliance with the Firm's\npolicies, standards and practices. The training is\nmandatory for all employees globally on a periodic\nbasis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing\ninitiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The\nFirm also provides specialized security training to\nemployees in specific roles, such as application\ndevelopers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires\nall employees to take periodic training on data\nprivacy that focuses on confidentiality and security,\nas well as responding to unauthorized access to or use\nof information.\nTechnology Resiliency , which establishes control\nrequirements for planning and testing the prioritized\nrecovery of technology services in the event of\ndegradation or outage, including incident response\nplanning, data backup and retention, and recovery\nreadiness in support of the Firmwide Business\nResiliency Program and operational risk management\npractices.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    149\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan\ndesigned to enable the Firm to respond to attempted\ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate\nwith law enforcement and other government agencies,\nnotify clients and customers, as applicable, and\nrecover from such incidents. In addition, the Firm\nactively partners with appropriate government and law\nenforcement agencies and peer industry forums,\nparticipating in discussions and simulations to assist\nin understanding the full spectrum of cybersecurity\nrisks and in enhancing defenses and improving\nresiliency in the Firm’s operating environment.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity\nand Technology Controls organization is designed to\nappropriately identify, escalate and mitigate\ncybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk management and\nits governance and oversight are integrated into the\nFirm’s operational risk management framework,\nincluding through the escalation of key risk and\ncontrol issues to management and the development of\nrisk mitigation plans for heightened risk and control\nissues. IRM independently assesses and challenges the\nactivities and risk management practices of the Global\nCybersecurity and Technology Controls organization\nrelated to the identification, assessment, measurement\nand mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As needed, the\nFirm engages third-party assessors or auditing firms\nwith industry-recognized expertise on cybersecurity\nmatters to review specific aspects of the Firm’s\ncybersecurity risk management framework, processes and\ncontrols.\nThe governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement includes governance forums that inform\nmanagement of key areas of concern regarding the\nprevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of\ncybersecurity risks.\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating\nCommittee (“CTOC”) is the principal management\ncommittee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and\nmanagement of cybersecurity risk, including oversight\nof the implementation and maintenance of appropriate\ncontrols in support of the Firm’s Information Security\nProgram. The membership of the CTOC includes senior\nrepresentatives from the Global Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Controls organization and relevant\ncorporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit.\nCTOC members have extensive experience and\nqualifications in various technology and information\nsecurity disciplines, including relevant experience at\nthe Firm, at other financial services companies or in\nother highly-regulated industries.\nThe CTOC escalates key operational risk and control\nissues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology\nOperating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control\ncommittee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate\nControl Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the\ngovernance of the Firmwide Global Technology\norganization, including oversight of Firmwide\ntechnology strategies, the delivery of technology and\ntechnology operations, the effective use of\ninformation technology resources, and monitoring and\nresolving key operational risk and control matters\narising in the Global Technology organization.\nAs part of its oversight of management’s\nimplementation and maintenance of the Firm’s risk\nmanagement framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors\nreceives periodic updates from the CIO, the CISO and\nsenior members of the CTOC concerning cybersecurity\nmatters. These updates generally include information\nregarding cybersecurity and technology developments,\nthe Firm’s Information Security Program and\nrecommended changes to that program, cybersecurity\npolicies and practices, and ongoing initiatives to\nimprove information security, as well as any\nsignificant cybersecurity incidents and the Firm's\nefforts to address those incidents. The Audit\nCommittee and the Risk Committee assist the Board in\nthis oversight.\n150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-\nregulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership\nof and accountability for managing their compliance\nrisk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\nOrganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”),\nwhich is independent of the LOBs and Corporate,\nprovides independent review, monitoring and oversight\nof business operations with a focus on compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the\ndelivery of the Firm’s products and services to\nclients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations across the LOBs and\nCorporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks\nrelated to financial products and services,\nrelationships and interactions with clients and\ncustomers, and employee activities. For example,\ncompliance risks include those associated with anti-\nmoney laundering compliance, trading activities,\nmarket conduct, and complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations related to the offering of products\nand services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance\nrisk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary\nactivities, including the failure to exercise the\napplicable standard of care to act in the best\ninterest of fiduciary clients and customers or to\ntreat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance\nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s\nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\ncompliance risk through the CCOR Management Framework.\nThe Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular\nupdates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit\nCommittee on significant compliance risk issues, as\nappropriate.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets\nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will\nconduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The\nCode provides the principles that help govern employee\nconduct with clients, customers, suppliers, vendors,\nshareholders, regulators, other employees, as well as\nwith the markets and communities in which the Firm\noperates. The Code requires employees to promptly\nreport any potential or actual violation of the Code,\nany Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable\nto the Firm’s business. It also requires employees to\nreport any illegal or unethical conduct, or conduct\nthat violates the underlying principles of the Code,\nby any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, clients,\ncustomers, suppliers, contract or temporary workers,\nor business partners or agents. Training is assigned\nto newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to\ncurrent employees periodically thereafter. Employees\nare required to affirm their compliance with the Code\nannually.\nEmployees can report any potential or actual\nviolations of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct\nHotline (the “Hotline”) by phone or the internet. The\nHotline is anonymous, where permitted by law, and is\navailable at all times globally, with translation\nservices and is administered by an outside service\nprovider. The Code prohibits retaliation against\nanyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith or\nassists with an inquiry or investigation.\nPeriodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on\nthe Code of Conduct program.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    151\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk that any action or misconduct by an employee\ncould lead to unfair client or customer outcomes,\nimpact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm\noperates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise\nthe Firm’s reputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying\nand managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate\nengagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture\nconsistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The\nBusiness Principles serve as a guide for how employees\nare expected to conduct themselves. With the Business\nPrinciples serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets\nout the Firm’s expectations for each employee and\nprovides information and resources to help e mployees\nconduct business ethically and in compliance with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere the\nFirm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on\npage 151 for further discussion of the Code.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\nconduct risk through the CCOR Management Framework .\nThe Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of\nthe Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more\nholistic view of conduct risks and to connect key\nprograms across the Firm in order to identify\nopportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum\nis responsible for setting overall program direction\nfor strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee\nconduct framework and reviewing the consolidated\nFirmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.\nConduct risk management encompasses various aspects of\npeople management practices throughout the employee\nlife cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training\nand development, performance management, promotion and\ncompensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO,\nand each designated corporate function completes an\nassessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews\nmetrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and\nprovides conduct education as appropriate.\n152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nLEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nLegal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the\nrisk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged\nfailure to meet legal obligations that arise from the\nrule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates, agreements with clients and customers, and\nproducts and services offered by the Firm.\nOverview\nThe global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal\nservices and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible\nfor managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:\nmanaging actual and potential litigation and\nenforcement matters, including internal reviews and\ninvestigations related to such matters\nadvising on products and services, including\ncontract negotiation and documentation\nadvising on offering and marketing documents and new\nbusiness initiatives\nmanaging dispute resolution\ninterpreting existing laws, rules and regulations,\nand advising on changes to them\nadvising on advocacy in connection with contemplated\nand proposed laws, rules and regulations, and\nproviding legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and\nthe Board.\nLegal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for\nthe Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is\nengaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s\nConflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale\ntransactions that may have the potential to create\nconflicts of interest for the Firm.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a\nmember of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk\nCommittee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The\nFirm’s General Counsel and other members of Legal\nreport on significant legal matters to the Firm’s\nBoard of Directors and to the Audit Committee.\nLegal serves on and advises various committees and\nadvises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential\nreputation risk issues.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    153\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\nEstimations and Model risk, a subcategory of\noperational risk, is the potential for adverse\nconsequences from decisions based on incorrect or\nmisused estimation outputs.\nThe Firm uses models and other analytical and\njudgment-based estimations across various businesses\nand functions. The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital\nrequirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating\nthe allowance for credit losses and making business\ndecisions. A dedicated independent function, Model\nRisk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and\ngoverns the Firm’s policies relating to the management\nof model risk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, such as\nthose used in risk management, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent\napproach which is used for models, as described in\ndetail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific\npurposes of such models. Users and developers of\nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing\nand testing their models, as well as referring models\nto MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been\napproved, model users and developers are responsible\nfor maintaining a robust operating environment, and\nmust monitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers\nmay seek to enhance models in response to changes in\nthe relevant portfolios and in product and market\ndevelopments, as well as to capture improvements in\navailable modeling techniques and systems\ncapabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated\nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In\nits review of a model, MRGR considers whether the\nmodel is suitable for the specific purposes for which\nit will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes\nand challenges the model methodology and the\nreasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform\nor require additional testing, including back-testing\nof model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the\nappropriate level of management within MRGR based on\nthe relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well\nas material changes to existing models, prior to their\nuse. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be\ngranted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be\nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to\nmitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the\ninterim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of\nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly\ntrue when the current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed.\nThis increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater\ndegree of judgment and analytics to inform any\nadjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs\nthan would otherwise be the case. In addition, the\nFirm may experience increased uncertainty in its\nestimates if assets acquired differ from those used to\ndevelop the models.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 155–158 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\n154    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its reported\nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm’s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance\nfor credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional\nU.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.\ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.\nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the\nloans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed\nas of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk\nrating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio,\nand the ongoing integration of products and systems,\nthe allowance for credit losses for the acquired\nwholesale portfolio was measured based on other\nfacilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk\ncharacteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As\nsuch, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is\nexcluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity\nanalysis below. The allowance for credit losses for\npredominantly all of the consumer portfolio was\nmeasured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the\nconsumer portfolio is predominantly residential real\nestate that has more commonly defined risk\ncharacteristics including loan to value ratio and\ncredit score, and therefore is reflected in the\nsensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for\nadditional information on the First Republic\nacquisition.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 131 and in Note 13 , the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment\nrate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the\neight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of\napproximately 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024;\nlower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining\nnearly 3.3% lower at the end of the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    155\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\napproximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024; and\nlower HPI with a peak difference of approximately\n17.9% in the third quarter of 2025. This analysis is\nnot intended to estimate expected future changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses, for a number of\nreasons, including: • The allowance as of December 31,\n2023 , reflects credit losses beyond those estimated\nunder the central scenario due to the weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios. • The impacts of changes in\nmany MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated\nfor more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate\nthe sensitivity of credit loss estimates to\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative\nadverse scenario to its central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: • An increase of approximately\n$850 million for residential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $3.1 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the\nFirm believes that its process to consider the\navailable information and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable\nand appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2023\n.\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nincluding certain mortgage, home equity and other\nloans, where the carrying value is based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at\nfair value The following table includes the Firm’s\nassets measured at fair value and the portion of such\nassets that are classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n156    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair\nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in\nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with\neach business combination is allocated to the related\nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated market\ncost of equity, as well as actual business results and\nprojections of business performance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired as of December 31, 2023. For each of the\nreporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by\nat least 9% and there was no indication of a\nsignificant risk of goodwill impairment based on\ncurrent projections and valuations.\nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are\nconsistent with management’s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best\nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in\nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of December 31, 2023.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an\neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety\nof rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form\nof account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm\nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected\nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is\naccrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is\nreduced when the cardholder redeems points. This\nliability was $13.2 billion and $11.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was predominantly driven by continued growth\nin rewards points earned on higher spend and\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout\n2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain\nreward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate\n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions. These\nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals, cardholder\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    157\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nredemption behavior and management judgment. Updates\nto these assumptions will impact the rewards\nliability. As of December 31, 2023, a combined\nincrease of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in\nCPP would increase the rewards liability by\napproximately $376 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be\nsubject to different interpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of accounting for income\ntaxes, including the provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must\nmake assumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain items\nmay affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\njurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by the\nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where\nthe Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding\nits view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities\nmay be settled by audit, administrative appeals or\nadjudication in the court systems of the tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan\nChase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed\nadditional income taxes as a result of the resolution\nof these matters, and the Firm records additional\nunrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In\naddition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income\ntaxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results\nof operations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets\nand liabilities measured for financial reporting\nversus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets\nare recognized if, in management’s judgment, their\nrealizability is determined to be more likely than not\n. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of\na change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax\ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs\nregular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews include\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions regarding\nfuture taxable income , including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be available\nto utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In\nconnection with these reviews, if it is determined\nthat a\ndeferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation\nallowance is established. The valuation allowance may\nbe reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the\nFirm determines that, based on revised estimates of\nfuture taxable income or changes in tax planning\nstrategies, it is more likely than not that all or\npart of the deferred tax asset will become realizable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, management has determined it\nis more likely than not that the Firm will realize its\ndeferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation\nallowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the\nreassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective\nincome tax rate in the period in which the\nreassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that\nits estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount\ncould be different from the amounts reflected in the\nFirm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the\nextent that the final outcome of these amounts is\ndifferent than the amounts recorded, such differences\nwill generally impact the Firm’s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination is\nmade.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of\ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred\ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and\nassumptions that could differ from the actual results\nreflected in income tax returns filed during the\nsubsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns\nare generally recorded in the period when the tax\nreturns are filed and the global tax implications are\nknown, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax\nrate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income\ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant\nestimates and judgments associated with establishing\nlitigation reserves.\n158    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards\nBoard\n(“FASB”) Standards Adopted since\nJanuary\n1, 2021\nStandard                              Summary of guidance                   Effects on financial statements\nProvides optional expedients and\nReference Rate                        exceptions to current accounting      •Issued and effective March 12,\nReform                                guidance when financial               2020.

(“JPMorgan Chase”\nor the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed by, or under the supervision of,\nthe Firm’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and\neffected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of\nJPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthe assessment, management used the “Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan\nChase’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management’s assessment, the\nFirm determined that there were no material weaknesses\nin its internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their\nreport which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 16, 2024\n162    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, including the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). We also have audited the\nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\nreferred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our\nopinion, the Firm maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in\nthe accompanying Management’s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free\nof material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary\nto permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew\nYork, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    163\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component\nof Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios was $20.2 billion on total\nportfolio-based retained loans of $881.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 . The Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the\nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the\nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied\nare determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take\ninto consideration the Firm's economic outlook as\nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S. unemployment and\nU.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of\nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as\nthe Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining\nthe quantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the\nadjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls\nover model validation and generation of macroeconomic\nscenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i)\nevaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion\nof its assets and $541.4 billion of its liabilities at\nfair value on a recurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $11.3 billion of trading assets and $42.2\nbillion of liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, collectively financial instruments,\nwhich are classified as level 3 as they contain one or\nmore inputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation models and\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the\nlevel 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs\nused by management to estimate the fair value of\ncertain of these financial instruments include\ninterest rate volatility, interest rate spread\nvolatility, Bermudan switch value, and correlation\nrelating to interest rates, interest rate-to-foreign\nexchange, equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange,\nequity-to-interest rate and credit.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the inputs to\nestimate fair value, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\nin performing procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence obtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\n164    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s determination of the fair value, including\ncontrols over models, inputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included, among others, the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an independent\nestimate of fair value for a sample of

Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 – Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed\ncertain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and\nservices associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations.\nAccordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in\nfuture periods. Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where\napplicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nConsolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in\nwhich the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase\nand are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the\nequity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations.\nFor these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based\non the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest,\nthrough ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights\nthat give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has\nsignificant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity\ninterests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the\nfair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss\nincluded in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or\nmanaging member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general\npartner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-\naffiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not\nconsolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or\nmembers do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and\nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially\nsignificant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-\nheld and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These\ninvestments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage\nof equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded\nin other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the\naccounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that,\nby design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to\nmake significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation\nto absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most\ncommon type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company\nselling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal\ndocuments that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s\ninvestors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate\ninvestors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of\nthe assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is\nrequired to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both\n(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance;\nand (2) through its interests in the VIE, the\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    171\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in\nestablishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the\nactivities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if\nany, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting\nthe VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights\nover the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power\nto direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the\nright to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of\nits economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other\narrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in\ndetermining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors\nconsidered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure;\nsubordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the\nVIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going\nreassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have\nbecome VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether\nchanges in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation\nconclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest\nincome The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a\nlevel-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information. Revenue from\ncontracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions and other fees, and components of\ncard income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion\nof the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a\nportion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal\ntransactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for\nfurther discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency\ntranslation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies\ninto U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency\nfinancial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains\nand losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional\ncurrency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and\nliabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance\nsheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and\npurchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be\npresented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including\nderivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting\nagreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement\nto be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default\n(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when\ndue). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are\nterminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted\nagainst the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is\nof one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase\n172    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nagreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all\nvalues of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each\nother and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination\namount. Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin\nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to\nthe party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically\nrequires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the\nmargin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold.\nThe collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-\noff any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted\ncollateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the\nproceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative\ninstruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements. Statements of\ncash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in\ncash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting standards adopted\nJanuary 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method The adoption of this guidance\nexpanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the\nportfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives\nthat could be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge\naccounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and\ndesignated those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on\nretained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. Financial Instruments –\nCredit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow\n(“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled\nborrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-\nmodification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to\napply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios\nexcept collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF\nmethodology. Refer to Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific\nallowance approach. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which\nresulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and an increase to retained earnings\nof $ 446million, after-tax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. The adoption of this\nguidance eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification\nis reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-\nthan-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined\nthese types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of\nloans considered FDMs differs from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of\ncurrent period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.

These assets and liabilities are\npredominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and\nreported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded\nlending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at\nfair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for\nexample, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not\navailable, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant\ntransaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters,\nincluding yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices),\ncorrelations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The\nlevel of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and\nconsistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment\nand may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants\ncompared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the\nreporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for\nassets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group\n(“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible\nfor verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the\nFirm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under\nthe direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain\ncorporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates\nprovided by the risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market\ndata, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to\nensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market\nactivity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing\nthe valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows,\nreviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of\nmanagement review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may\nbe required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for\ninstruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further\ninformation on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for\nvaluation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such\nadjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where\nan observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower\nmarket activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be\nconsidered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the\ninstrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the\nrange of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to\nestimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an\norderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting\na larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that\na relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of\nthe adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk\nposition. • Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using\nprices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    175\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nbecause they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are,\ntherefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the\nresulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value\nin order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the\nimpact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on\npage 192 of this Note for more information on such adjustments. Valuation model review and approval If prices or\nquotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using\nvaluation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied\nto the inputs in those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and\napproves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating\nenvironment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used\nprior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk\nif it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation\nof trading activity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP\nfor disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the\nvaluation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 –\ninputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nin active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for\nsubstantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation\nmethodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s categorization\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\n176    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant\nproducts/instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument                    Valuation methodology                 Classifications in the fair value\nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements       Valuations are based on discounted    Predominantly level 2\ncash flows, which consider:\nDerivative features: refer to\nthe\ndiscussion of derivatives below\nfor\nfurther information\nMarket rates for the respective\nmaturity\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related\ncommitments — wholesale               Where observable market data is\nLoans carried at fair value           available, valuations are based       Level 2 or 3\n(trading loans and non-trading        on:\nloans) and associated\nlending-related commitments\nObserved market prices\n(circumstances\nare infrequent)\nRelevant broker quotes\nObserved market prices for\nsimilar\ninstruments\nWhere observable market data is\nunavailable or limited, valuations\nare\nbased on discounted cash flows,\nwhich\nconsider the following:\nCredit spreads derived from the\ncost\nof CDS;

term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge\naccounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities\ninventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    181\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and\nother funds, were $ 1.0billion and $ 950million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, were trading assets of $ 42million and $ 43million, respectively, and other assets of $ 984million and $\n907million, respectively.\n(e) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, included $ 10.2billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of residential first-lien\nmortgages, and $ 6.0billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government\nagencies of $ 2.9billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n182    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair\nvalue is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 175–179 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to\nthe lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of\nsuch inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In\naddition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input\nvalues presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the\ndegree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and\narithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    183\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3\ninputs(…\nDecember\n31, 2023\nFair                 Principal    Unobserv…

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a\nchange in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do\nexist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following\ndiscussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that\naffect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the\ninterest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield,\nin isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the\namount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for\ntaking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security\nprimarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the\ncoupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the\nrange of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit\nspreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a\ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par\nand an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the\nremaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being\npaid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The\nconditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between\nconditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has\nhigh prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in\nthe conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional\ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional\ndefault rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the\ninverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate\nliquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An\nincrease in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in\nvaluing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV\nratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    185\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation\ninputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one\nparameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or\na decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in\nisolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the\nvaluation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of\nthose risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between\ntwo interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as\nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a\nmeasure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the\nparticular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options,\nincluding equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in\nisolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the\nvaluation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from\nthat of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which\ncan be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional\nvalue that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can\nvary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price\nof the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement . Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the relationship of interest rates over\ndiffering tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows\nand is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price – The forward price\nis the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined\nfuture delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as\nan input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the\ncurrent price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the\nseller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an\nincrease or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The\nfollowing tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)\nfor financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3,\nthe determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable\nfactors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3\nfinancial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such\nlevel 3 instruments.\n186    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nFa…                                                                                          Ch…\nva…

Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    191\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit and funding adjustments – derivatives\nDerivatives are generally valued using models that use\nas their basis observable market parameters. These\nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors\nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s\nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it\nis generally necessary to make adjustments to the base\nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA\nrepresents the adjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect\ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates\nCVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected\npositive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s\nexisting positions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of default\nand estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the\nprobability of a default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated\nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied\nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences\nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to\nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally\nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents\nthe adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is\nrecognized where there is evidence that a market\nparticipant in the principal market would incorporate\nit in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the\nexpected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s\npositions with\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at\nthe relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with the counterparty,\nand therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue\nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality\non the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality\nover time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                              2023           2022            2021\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA                    $  221          $  22          $  362\nDerivatives FVA                       114             42              47\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm’s own credit risk.

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect\nthe different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the\nFirm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments\nrecorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common\nshares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters\ninvolving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875at December 31, 2023 and may be\nadjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation\nmatters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown.\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on\nVisa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of\nthese considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to\nVisa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the\npurchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.\nUnder the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent\nchanges in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The\npayments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer\nrestrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology\nbased upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The\nderivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other\nincome. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that\nthe Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\nOn January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa’s stockholders\napproved amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to Visa Class B-1\ncommon shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers (\"the Program\") which,\nif conducted, would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa's B-1 shares through an\nexchange for Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”). The Program would entitle the Firm to exchange its Visa\nB-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares (”Visa B-2 shares”) and Visa C shares, through an initial exchange\noffer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would continue to be subject to the transfer restrictions\nassociated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then entitled to sell the Visa C shares received after a brief lock-\nup period expires, and Visa is also authorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, each enabling the\nrelease of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or\nfuture exchange offer is dependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm’s\ncontrol.\n194    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial\ninstruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as\nnonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion\nof management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase. Financial instruments for\nwhich carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature\nand generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks,\nfederal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables\nand accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under\nrepurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair\nvalue of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be\nequal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDec…                                                   Dec…\n31,                                                    31,\n2023                                                   2022\nEst…                                                   Es…\nfair                                                   fa…\nval…                                                   va…\nhie…                                                   hi…\nTot…                                                 Tot…\n(in       Car…       Lev…       Lev…       Lev…       est…       Car…       Le…       Lev…       Le…       est…\nbi…       val…          1          2          3       fair       val…         1          2         3       fair\nval…                                                 val…\nFi…\nas…\nCa…\nand\ndue    $  29.1    $  29.1    $     —    $     —    $  29.1    $  27.7    $  27…    $     —    $    —    $  27.7\nfr…\nba…\nDe…\nwi…       595…       594…        0.5          —       595…       539…       53…        0.2         —       539…\nba…\nAc…\nin…\nand       107…          —       107…        0.1       107…       124…         —       124…       0.1       124…\nac…\nre…\nFe…\nfu…\nso…\nand\nse…       16.3          —       16.3          —       16.3        3.7         —        3.7         —        3.7\npu…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSe…       130…          —       130…          —       130…       115…         —       115…         —       115…\nbo…\nIn…\nse…       369…       160…       182…          —       342…       425…       18…       199…         —       388…\nhe…\nLo…\nnet\nof\nal…       1,2…          —       285…       964…       1,2…       1,0…         —       194…       85…       1,0…\nfor\nlo…\nlo…\nOt…       76.1          —       74.9        1.4       76.3       101…         —       99.6       1.7       101…\nFi…\nli…\nDe…    $  2,3…    $     —    $  2,3…    $     —    $  2,3…    $  2,3…    $    —    $  2,3…    $    —    $  2,3…\nFe…\nfu…\npu…\nand\nse…\nlo…       47.5          —       47.5          —       47.5       50.6         —       50.6         —       50.6\nor\nso…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSh…       24.7          —       24.7          —       24.7       28.2         —       28.2         —       28.2\nbo…\nAc…\npa…\nand       241…          —       233…        8.1       241…       257…         —       251…       5.6       256…\not…\nli…\nBe…\nin…\nis…       23.0          —       23.0          —       23.0       12.6         —       12.6         —       12.6\nby\nco…\nVI…\nLo…       303…          —       252…       51.3       303…       223…         —       216…       2.8       219…\nde…\n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,\nincluding expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary\nmarket spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at\nfair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between\nthe measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an\naccrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as\nwell as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair\nvalue includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing\nactivity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related\ncommitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets\nthat contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a\nderivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial\ninstruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities\nCertain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying\nassets are carried at fair value\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    197\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

Refer to Note 7 for further information\nregarding interest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk,\nwere determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are\nattributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value\nfor the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are\ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s\ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of\nagreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the\nprincipal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-\nspecific credit risk related to these agreements.\n198    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, for loans, long-term debt and long-term\nbeneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nDece…\n31,                                               Fair                                                 Fair\n(in                                              value                                                value\nmill…         2023                              over/…             2022                              over/…\nLoans       Contr…                              contr…           Contr…                              contr…\nNona…       princ…                   Fair       princ…           princ…                   Fair       princ…\nloans       outst…                  value       outst…           outst…                  value       outst…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas       $   2,987              $     588    $  -2,399        $   2,517              $     368    $  -2,149\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans          838                    732         -106              967                    829         -138\nSubt…        3,825                  1,320       -2,505            3,484                  1,197       -2,287\n90 or\nmore\ndays\npast\ndue\nand\ngove…\nguar…\nLoan…           65                     59           -6              124                    115           -9\nAll\nother\nperf…\nloan…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas           9,547                  7,968       -1,579            7,823                  6,135       -1,688\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans       38,948                 38,060         -888           42,588                 41,135       -1,453\nSubt…       48,495                 46,028       -2,467           50,411                 47,270       -3,141\nTotal    $  52,385              $  47,407    $  -4,978        $  54,019              $  48,582    $  -5,437\nloans\nLong…\ndebt\nPrin…    $  47,768        -d    $  38,882    $  -8,886        $  41,341        -d    $  31,105    $  -10,2…\ndebt\nNonp…               NA             49,042               NA               NA             41,176               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $  87,924               NA               NA          $  72,281               NA\ndebt\nLong…\nbene…\ninte…\nNonp…               NA          $       1               NA               NA          $       5               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $       1               NA               NA          $       5               NA\nbene…\ninte…\n(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies.\n(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term\nbeneficial interests.

Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are\nmanaged primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the\nportfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty\nbasis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,\nsecuritizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular\nloan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and\ncollateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for\ncredit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    201\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the\nFirm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in\nderivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of\nthe Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to\nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or\nselling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk\nmanagement derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments,\nincluding derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the\nrisk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in\nmarket value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of\nvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses\non the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain\nforeign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or\nforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to\nmanage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are\nexpected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are\nused to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the\nCredit derivatives section on pages 214–216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to\nthe risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables\non pages 211–213 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and\nsettlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the\nderivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange\nand cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared\nderivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges\nand clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the\noffsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not\nthe transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as\nhedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 207–214 of this\nNote provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and\nlosses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    203\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management\nactivities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk\nof loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For\nthe same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity\nderivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be\ndesignated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must\nidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as\ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those\nterms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS\nsecurities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain\namounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life\nof the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to\nearnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the\nclassification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the\nability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio,\nand to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. The Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage the interest\nrate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments are\nmaintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to individual assets under certain circumstances. These\ninclude instances where the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-\ndesignation. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash\nflows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For\nqualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in\nearnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with\nthe classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation\nexpense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is\nrecognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are\ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast,\nany related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net\ninvestment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches\nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar.

It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk\ninherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk,\nas the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as\nthe fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and\nits subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the\ncontract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-\ncleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings\ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables\ncontaining downgrade triggers\n(in millions)                                  December 31, 2023                 December 31, 2022\nAggregate fair value of net derivative                              $  14,655                         $  16,023\npayables\nCollateral posted                                                      14,673                            15,505\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrelated to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be\ntriggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating\nagency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major\nrating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity\nimpact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies\nreferred to in the derivative contract.\nLiquidity impact\nof downgrade\ntriggers\non OTC and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives            December 31, 2023                               December 31, 2022\n(in millions)               Single-notch               Two-notch            Single-notch              Two-notch\ndowngrade               downgrade               downgrade              downgrade\nAmount of\nadditional\ncollateral to be    $                 75    $              1,153    $                128    $             1,293\nposted upon\ndowngrade(a)\nAmount required\nto settle\ncontracts with                        93                     592                      88                    925\ntermination\ntriggers upon\ndowngrade(b)\n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the\neconomic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

Gains and losses were recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue.\n(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate\nforeign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses\nwere recorded in principal transactions revenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management\ncategories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection\npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments\nunder the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its\nobligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has\nthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is\nboth a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit\nderivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the\nneeds of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives\ncounterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial\ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\n214    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-\nname”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts.\nSingle-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are\nused to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P\n500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series\nof CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the\nreference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios\nof reference names or against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide protection against the first $\n1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as\ntranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event,\nunder the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The\nprotection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS\ncontract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known\nas the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying\nreference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related\nnotes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-\nrelated note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the\ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in\nreturn, the issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The\nissuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the\nentities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the\nissuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference\nbetween the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following\ntables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically\npay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid\non the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The\nFirm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar\nunderlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit\nderivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and\nother reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other purchased\nprotection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio through the\nissuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    215\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such\nderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit\nevent, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of\nwhich reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\nTotal credit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-related\nnotes\nDecember 31,\n2023                         Maximum    Protection\n(in millions)        payout/Notional    purchased with                      Net protection                Other\nCredit                        amount    identical                          (sold)/purchas…           protection\nderivatives          Protection sold    underlyings(c)                                  d)         purchased(e)\nCredit default    $         -450,172                      $  473,823    $           23,651    $           7,517\nswaps\nOther credit                 -38,846                          45,416                 6,570               29,206\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit                -489,018                         519,239                30,221               36,723\nderivatives\nCredit-related                     —                               —                     —                9,788\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $         -489,018                      $  519,239    $           30,221    $          46,511\nMaximum\npayout/Notional\namount\nProtection                                                        Other\nProtection sold    purchased with                      Net protection           protection\nidentical                          (sold)/purchas…         purchased(e)\nunderlyings(c)\nDecember 31,\n2022\n(in millions)\nCredit\nderivatives\nCredit default    $         -495,557                      $  509,846    $           14,289    $           2,917\nswaps\nOther credit                 -47,165                          65,029                17,864               11,746\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit                -542,722                         574,875                32,153               14,663\nderivatives\nCredit-related                     —                               —                     —                7,863\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $         -542,722                      $  574,875    $           32,153    $          22,526\n(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.\n(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is\nidentical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each\nindividual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection\nsold.\n(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would\ngenerally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement\nvalue.\n(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where\nthe Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of\ncredit derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.

The related contracts are\noften terminable on demand and the Firm has no\nremaining obligation to deliver future services. For\narrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue associated\nwith these remaining performance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future events or\nunderlying asset values, and is not recognized until\nthe outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue category includes\ndebt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via\npublic offering and private placement of various types\nof debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are recognized as\nrevenue typically upon execution of the client’s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan\narrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees,\nincluded within debt underwriting fees, are recorded\nas revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing\nand yield criteria.

In\nconnection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments,\nderivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference\ncommodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:\nderivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and\nforeign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit,\nforeign exchange and interest rate risks. Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement\nclassification of gains and losses from derivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm\ntransacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying\ncommodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and\nmay hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table\npresents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table\nexcludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the\noverall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in\nTreasury and CIO.

Mortgage fees and related income This revenue\ncategory reflects CCB’s Home Lending production and\nnet mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue\nincludes fees and income recognized as earned on\nmortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and\nthe impact of risk management activities associated\nwith the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.\nProduction revenue also includes gains and losses on\nsales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on\nmortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain\nrepurchased loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies), and changes in the fair value of financial\ninstruments measured under the fair value option. Net\nmortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue\nearned from servicing third-party mortgage loans,\nwhich is recognized over the period in which the\nservice is provided; changes in the fair value of\nMSRs; the impact of risk management activities\nassociated with MSRs; and gains and losses on\nsecuritization of excess mortgage servicing. Net\nmortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and\nlosses on sales and lower of cost or fair value\nadjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by\nU.S. government agencies. Refer to Note 15 for further\ninformation on risk management activities and MSRs.\nNet interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in\ninterest income. Card income This revenue category\nincludes interchange and other income from credit and\ndebit card transactions; and fees earned from\nprocessing card transactions for merchants, both of\nwhich are recognized when purchases are made by a\ncardholder and presented net of certain transaction-\nrelated costs. Card income also includes account\norigination costs and annual fees, which are deferred\nand recognized on a straight-line basis over a\n12-month period. Certain credit card products offer\nthe cardholder the ability to earn points based on\naccount activity, which the cardholder can choose to\nredeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the\nFirm related to these proprietary rewards programs\nvaries based on multiple factors including the terms\nand conditions of the rewards\nprograms, cardholder activity, cardholder reward\nredemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The\nFirm maintains a liability for its obligations under\nits rewards programs and reports the current-period\ncost as a reduction of card income. Credit card\nrevenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual\nagreements with numerous co-brand partners that grant\nthe Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit\ncard products and market them to the customers of such\npartners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit\ncard programs and provide their customer or member\nlists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct\nmarketing activities and provide rewards redeemable\nunder their own loyalty programs that the Firm will\ngrant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account\nactivity. The terms of these agreements generally\nrange from fiveto ten years. The Firm typically makes\npayments to the co-brand credit card partners based on\nthe cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty\nprogram rewards provided to credit cardholders, new\naccount originations and sales volumes. Payments to\npartners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the\npartners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and\nreported as marketing expense. Payments for partner\nloyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of\ncard income when incurred. Payments to partners based\non new credit card account originations are accounted\nfor as direct loan origination costs and are deferred\nand recognized as a reduction of card income on a\nstraight-line basis over a 12-month period.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new\nparticipants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S.\nemployees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1,\n2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts\nbased on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that\nprovide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered\nunder these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements\nin certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the\n401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k)\nSavings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit\ncontributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts\nrecorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB\nplans.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,              Defined benefit\n(in millions)                                  pension and OPEB plans  2023                2022\nProjected benefit obligations               $                 -14,740          $  -13,545\nFair value of plan assets                                      22,013              19,890\nNet funded status                                               7,273               6,345\nAccumulated other comprehensive                                -1,517              -1,916\nincome/(loss)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was\n5.16% and 5.14%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in\nOCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent\nperiods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected\nbenefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected\nremaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets, partially offset\nby changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a\nremeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a\npension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S. principal\ndefined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the\nplan’s projected benefit obligation totaling $ 4.0billion and $ 2.6billion, respectively, resulting in a net\ndecrease of $ 1.4billion in pre-tax AOCI.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the\ndefined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nYear ended December 31, (in\nmillions)                           Pension and OPEB plans  2023            2022                     2021\nTotal net periodic defined\nbenefit plan                     $                    -393        $   -192          -b    $    -201          -b\ncost/(credit)(a)\nTotal defined contribution                           1,609           1,408                    1,333\nplans\nTotal pension and OPEB cost\nincluded in                      $                   1,216        $  1,216                $   1,132\nnoninterest expense\nTotal recognized in other\ncomprehensive                    $                    -421        $  1,459                $  -1,129\n(income)/loss\n(a) The service cost component of net periodic defined benefit cost is reported in compensation expense; all other\ncomponents of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of\nincome.\n(b) Includes pension settlement losses of $ 92million and $ 33million, respectively, for the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2021.\n222    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit\ncosts for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31,                                                   2023       2022       2021\nDiscount rate                                                             5.14  %    2.54  %    2.17  %\nExpected long-term rate of return on                                      5.74  %    3.68  %    2.97  %\nplan assets\nPlan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of\nreturn is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for the\nvarious asset classes, taking into consideration local\nmarket conditions and the specific allocation of plan\nassets.

The discount rates used in determining the\nbenefit obligations are generally provided by the\nFirm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by\nreference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with\nmaturity dates and coupons that closely match each of\nthe plan’s projected cash flows.\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in\nvarious trusts and are invested in well-diversified\nportfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash\nand cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The\nFirm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset\nmanagers, as well as other factors that could impact\nthe portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed\nnecessary. As of December 31, 2023, the approved asset\nallocation ranges by asset class for the Firm’s\nprincipal defined benefit plan are 42- 100% debt\nsecurities, 0- 40% equity securities, 0- 2% real\nestate, and 0- 10% alternatives. Assets held by the\nFirm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not\ninclude securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its\naffiliates, except through indirect exposures through\ninvestments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and\ncollective investment funds managed by third-parties.\nThe defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold\ninvestments that are sponsored or managed by\naffiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $\n1.8billion and $ 1.7billion, as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nFair value measurement of the plans’ assets and\nliabilities\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2,\nand 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation\nmethods employed by the Firm.\nPens…\nplan\nasse…\nand\nliab…       Defin…\nmeas…       benef…\nat          pensi…\nfair           and\nvalue         OPEB\nDece…        plans\n31,           2023                                  Total         2022                                    Total\n(in          Level        Level        Level         fair        Level         Level        Level          fair\nmill…         1(a)         2(b)         3(c)        value         1(a)          2(b)         3(c)         value\nAsse…\nmeas…\nat\nfair\nvalue\nclas…    $   6,521    $  10,713    $   3,124    $  20,358    $   5,308    $    9,617    $   2,613    $   17,538\nin\nthe\nfair\nvalue\nhier…\nAsse…\nmeas…\nat\nfair\nvalue                                               2,097                                                 2,593\nusing\nNAV\nas a\nprac…\nexpe…\nNet\ndefi…\nbene…                                                -442                                                  -241\npens…\nplan\npaya…\nTotal\nfair\nvalue                                           $  22,013                                            $   19,890\nof\nplan\nasse…\n(a) Consists predominantly of equity securities, U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government debt\nsecurities, and cash equivalents.\n(b) Consists predominantly of corporate debt securities and U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government\ndebt securities.\n(c) Consists of corporate-owned life insurance policies, fund investments, and participating annuity contracts in\n2023, and corporate-owned life insurance policies and participating annuity contracts in 2022.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    223\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nChanges in level 3 fair value measurements using\nsignificant unobservable inputs Investments classified\nin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy increased in\n2023 to $ 3.1billion, due to $ 400million in\nunrealized gains and $ 173million of transfers in,\npartially offset by $ 59million in settlements.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54million shares of common stock were available for\nissuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based\nincentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of\nacquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based\nincentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted\nannually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common\nstock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow\nemployees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject\nto post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain\nclawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs\nentitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock\nduring the period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation\nprogram. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The\nnumber of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue\nduring the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend\nequivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend\nequivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax\nwithholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of\napproximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI\nPlans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of\nJPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs generally expire ten yearsafter the grant date. In 2021, the\nFirm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5million and 750,000SARs,\nrespectively. There were nogrants of SARs in 2023 or 2022. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for\neach tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date.\nGenerally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant\ndate until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career\neligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no\nfuture substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to\nemployees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each\ntranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense\nis recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career\neligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon\nsettlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury\nshares. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury\nshares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of\ncalculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    225\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by\nthe stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation\nmodel. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.

Debt securities classified as\ntrading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury\nand CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities are carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or\nallowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried\nat amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM\nsecurities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over\nthe contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting\nguidance which permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of\nU.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million\nnet pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. Refer to Note 1 and Note 24 for additional information. During 2022, the\nFirm transferred investment securities with a fair value of $ 78.3billion from AFS to HTM for capital management\npurposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $ 4.8billion on the securities at the date of transfer.\nUnrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are\namortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization\nwill offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the\ntransfer recorded at fair value.

Refer to Note\n34 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    229\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAFS securities are considered impaired if the fair\nvalue is less than the amortized cost. The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm\nhas the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment\nloss is recognized in investment securities\ngains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and is equal to the full difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and\nthe fair value of the security. For impaired debt\nsecurities that the Firm has the intent and ability to\nhold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a\ncredit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit\nloss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance\nfor credit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on\ndebt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded\nin OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses\ninclude adverse conditions specifically related to the\nindustry, geographic area or financial condition of\nthe issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and\npayment structure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess spread,\novercollateralization or other forms of credit\nenhancement, and compares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the\nlevel of credit enhancement in the securitization\nstructure to determine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a\ncredit loss exists. For beneficial interests in\nsecuritizations that are rated below “AA” at their\nacquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or\notherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would\nnot recover substantially all of its recorded\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit\nlosses when there is an adverse change in expected\ncash flows.\nHTM securities – credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities represents expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the securities. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities is calculated by applying\nstatistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD)\nto the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are\nderived using a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation\nto revert to long run historical information for\nperiods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13\nfor further information on the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S.\nresidential mortgage-backed securities is calculated\nas the difference between the amortized cost and the\npresent value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the security’s effective\ninterest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed\nbased on expectations of underlying collateral\nperformance derived using the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as considering the\nstructural features of the security. The application\nof different inputs and assumptions into the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is\nsubject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or\nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect\nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities. Credit quality indicator The primary\ncredit quality indicator for HTM securities is the\nrisk rating assigned to each security.At December 31,\n2023 and 2022, all HTM securities were rated\ninvestment grade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 99% and 98% rated at least AA+,\nrespectively.

computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio\nhedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal\nprepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected\nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield\nis calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 34million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 73million at December\n31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $\n94million at December 31, 2023.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately seven yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven yearsfor agency residential\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, and six yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n(d) Includes AFS securities associated with First Republic, primarily due after 10 years. Refer to Note 34 for\nadditional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    231\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,\n“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover\nshort sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s\nexcess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the\nsame counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets\nand liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the\nlife of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm\nhas elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option\nhas been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,\nwith changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for\nhybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)\nthat it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged\ncollateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin\nlevels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the\npermissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash\nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to\nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It\nis also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in\nsecurities financing agreements.\n232    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the\neconomic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet\npresentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master\nnetting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or\nobtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The\ntransferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded\nprimarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n234    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 12 – Loans\nLoan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n“retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of\nthe Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment,\nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign\nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on\nperforming loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are recognized in\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued\ninterest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then\nrecognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit\nlosses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not\nrecognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them\noff no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on\nwhich the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment\nof principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has\nbeen in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment\nis due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual\nstatus. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed\nagainst interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on\nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded\nloan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the\nrecorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest\nincome on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the\nterms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from\nbeing placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue\nuntil the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents\nthe estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated\nstatements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance\nfor loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized\ncost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with\nan offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with\nstandards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business\nbanking loans are generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans,\nincluding modified credit card accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120days past\ndue. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC\ncharge-off standards in the following circumstances: • Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty that are determined to be collateral-dependent.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    235\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are\nsubject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or\ncharged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the\nautomobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the\ngovernment-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has\nbeen realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the\nprioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its\namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair\nvalue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the\ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes.\nFor illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation\nsources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s\nprice opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation\n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12months, or more frequently depending on various\nmarket factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by\ntaking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that\nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted\nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans,\ncollateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values\nare typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans\nheld-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded\nin noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans,\nthe valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts\nor premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and\ndiscounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s\nnonaccrual policies. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at\nfair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued\nand recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized\nin the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are\nsubject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair\nvalue accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried\nat fair value and classified as trading assets.\n236    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-\nrelated losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to\nchanges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event\nthat management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to\nmodify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the\nFirm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments\nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays\nor principal forgiveness. Effective January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses:\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosure accounting guidance, which changed the accounting for loan\nmodifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further information . Loans, except for credit card loans,\nreported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on\nnonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest\nis resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a\nminimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan\nis reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral\nvalues, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in\nwhich the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of\nmodification. The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is measured using the Firm’s established\nallowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for\nfurther discussion. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of loans where the Firm granted\nconcessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty were accounted for and reported as TDRs. The\nconcessions granted varied by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and included interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in\nlieu of payments. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions\nwere not TDRs. Loans modified in TDRs were generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-\nspecific allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remained subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its\nremaining life, regardless of whether the loan was performing and had been returned to accrual status. Refer to\nNote 13 for further discussion. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan\nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real\nestate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and\nships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking\nlegal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the\nasset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the\nborrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially\nrecognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is\nreviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are\ncharged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged\nto other expense.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    237\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to\ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

Loans that are more than 30days past\ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable\nor unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely\nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater\nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar\nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary\nbased on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or\nthe combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the\nevent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit\npayment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher\nrisk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a\nlow FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit\nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights\ninto the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\n240    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate\nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

Revolving loans that have\nbeen converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.\nThat is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than\nthe minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    241\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential\nreal estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average\ndata)                                                  December 31, 2023                      December 31, 2022\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)            $    3,466                             $    3,745\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(f)(g)(h)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO\nscores:\nEqual to or greater than 660               $       72                             $        2\nLess than 660                                       —                                      —\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                      223                                    174\nLess than 660                                       4                                      6\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                    6,491                       -l        12,034\nLess than 660                                     102                                    184\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO\nscores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                  309,251                       -l       215,096\nLess than 660                                   9,277                       -l         8,659\nNo FICO/LTV available(i)                          989                                  1,406\nTotal retained loans                       $  326,409                       -m    $  237,561\nWeighted average LTV ratio(f)(j)                   49  %                                  51  %\nWeighted average FICO(g)(j)                       770                                    769\nGeographic region(i)(k)\nCalifornia                                 $  127,072                       -n    $   73,112\nNew York                                       48,815                       -n        34,471\nFlorida                                        22,778                       -n        18,870\nTexas                                          15,506                                 14,968\nMassachusetts                                  14,213                       -n         6,380\nIllinois                                       10,856                                 11,296\nColorado                                       10,800                                  9,968\nWashington                                      9,923                                  9,060\nNew Jersey                                      8,050                                  7,108\nConnecticut                                     7,163                                  5,432\nAll other                                      51,233                                 46,896\nTotal retained loans                       $  326,409                             $  237,561\n(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less costs to sell.

The financial effects of the\nFDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n20years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual\ninterest rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. There were noadditional commitments\nto lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nwhose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to\nFDMs, the Firm also had $ 69million of loans subject\nto a trial modification, and $ 9million of Chapter 7\nloans for the year ended December 31, 2023. The\nchanges to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the\nTDR reasonably expected and concession assessment\ncriteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter\n7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to\nNote 1 for further information. Payment status of FDMs\nand redefaults For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nresidential real estate FDMs of $ 29million were 30 or\nmore days past due and FDMs that re-defaulted were $\n17million. Nature and extent of TDRs For periods\nending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of\nresidential real estate loans where the Firm granted\nconcessions to borrowers who were experiencing\nfinancial difficulty were generally accounted for and\nreported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that were not considered\nconcessions were not TDRs. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $ 362million\nand $ 866million, and there were no additional\ncommitments to lend to borrowers whose residential\nreal estate loans were modified in TDRs. The Firm’s\nproprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\ngenerally provide various concessions to financially\ntroubled borrowers including, but not limited to,\ninterest rate reductions, term or payment extensions\nand delays of principal and/or interest payments that\nwould otherwise have been required under the terms of\nthe original agreement.

In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain\nnonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or\nthe fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral\nimproves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at December 31, 2023.\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nauto and other FDMs were not material and there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers modified as\nFDMs. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of auto and other loans where the Firm granted\nconcessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as\nTDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not\nTDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, auto and other TDRs were not material.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    245\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit card loan portfolio\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency\nrates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that\nborrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been\ndelinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the\ngeographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does\nnot view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a\nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the\nportfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random\nsample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the\nindustry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the\ncardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency and gross charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(in millions, except ratios)                         December 31, 2023\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                  205,731     $    882     $  206,613\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                           2,217           84          2,301\n90 or more days past due and still                               2,169           40          2,209\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                  210,117     $  1,006     $  211,123\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                          2.09  %     12.33  %        2.14  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                          1.03         3.98           1.05\nloans\nGross charge-offs                           $                    5,325     $    166     $    5,491\n(in millions, except ratios)                         December 31, 2022\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                  181,793     $    696     $  182,489\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                           1,356           64          1,420\n90 or more days past due and still                               1,230           36          1,266\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                  184,379     $    796     $  185,175\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                          1.40  %     12.56  %        1.45  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                          0.67         4.52           0.68\nloans\n246    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)                           December 31, 2023              December 31, 2022\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia                                 $   32,652                     $   28,154\nTexas                                          22,086                         19,171\nNew York                                       16,915                         15,046\nFlorida                                        15,103                         12,905\nIllinois                                       11,364                         10,089\nNew Jersey                                      8,688                          7,643\nOhio                                            6,424                          5,792\nColorado                                        6,307                          5,493\nPennsylvania                                    6,088                          5,517\nArizona                                         5,209                          4,487\nAll other                                      80,287                         70,878\nTotal retained loans                       $  211,123                     $  185,175\nPercentage of portfolio based on\ncarrying value with estimated refreshed\nFICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660                     85.8  %                        86.8  %\nLess than 660                                    14.0                           13.0\nNo FICO available                                 0.2                            0.2\n(a) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at December 31, 2023.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which\neffective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card\naccount on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the\ncredit card account. If the borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment\nterms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-\noff policy.

The Firm granted concessions for most of the\ncredit card loans under long-term programs. These\nconcessions involved placing the customer’s credit\ncard account on a fixed payment plan, generally for\n60months, and typically included reducing the interest\nrate on the credit card account. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm’s long-term programs were\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that were not considered\nconcessions were not reported as TDRs.\nThe following table provides information about the\nfinancial effects of the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the\nperiods presented.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating\nassigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within\nthe portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will\ndefault. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several\nfactors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s\ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however\nthe quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3\nor higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the\ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s\ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist\nof special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. Risk ratings\nare reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated\ninformation affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan\nconsiders the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management\nframework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with\nparticular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further\ndetail on industry concentrations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    249\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nInternal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.

There were\nnoadditional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties for Secured by real\nestate loan FDMs. Nature and extent of TDRs Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered\nTDRs. These loan modifications provided various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty.\nLoans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor\nwere loans for which the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES\nAct. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs were $ 801million and $ 881million, respectively. New\nTDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily\nin the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the impact of these\nmodifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement\nto assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans\nconsidered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.\n254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • t he allowance for loan losses,\nwhich covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses\nis complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller\nof the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and\nother factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future\nperiods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related\ncommitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to\ndetermine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are\nnot unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally\ncancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance\non other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write t hese receivables off no later than 90 days past\ndue by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual\nterm, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of\nfunded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account,\nand determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the\nbalance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the\npayment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009,\ngenerally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes\nexpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result\nin a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk\ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively,\nconsidering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will\ndeteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment.\nEmphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.\nRelevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO\nscores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics\nfor the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,\ngeography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the\nFirm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively\nassessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans,\nperforming risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk\ncharacteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis,\nconsidering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The\nasset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that\nconsiders the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The\nquantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by\napplying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the\nprobability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    255\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nto revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five\nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside\nscenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and\ninvolve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and\nRisk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging\nrisk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed\nperiods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking\ninto account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting\nstandards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as\nwell as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain\ninstances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different\ninputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative\ncalculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another,\nor considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the\nallowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of\nthe allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually. On January 1, 2023 the\nFirm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance as\ndescribed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs\nusing a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for\nmodified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these\nmodified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-\nmodification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its\nnon-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except\ncollateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will\ncontinue to apply. The adoption did not impact the collateral-dependent allowance approach or scope. This guidance\nwas adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit\nlosses of $ 587million and an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less\nestimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce\nthe amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be\nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of the collateral).\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference\nbetween the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted\nat the loan’s effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment\nto the allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans\nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates,\nprincipal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to\nrepay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as\nthese cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing\nof interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of\ncurrent and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of\ncurrent overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of\ninsolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. Other financial\nassets In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial assets that are measured at\namortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit exposures arising from lending activities\nsubject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management estimates the allowance for other financial assets using\nvarious techniques considering historical losses and current economic conditions. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term\nnature of the activity, the\n256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nfair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide additional\nmargin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these exposures\ngenerally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, management may also consider other factors such\nas the borrower’s ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements, or whether collateral is\nsignificantly concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar risk characteristics. If in\nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    257\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of loans\nand lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $ 1.9billion,\nconsisting of: • $ 1.3billion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $ 1.4billion in Card\nServices, partially offset by a net reduction of $ 200million in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services\nwas driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower\nuncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices, and • $\n675million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted\naverage macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an\naddition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-\nrelated commitment portfolios. The net addition also included $ 1.2billion to establish the allowance for the First\nRepublic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted\naverage macroeconomic outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect\na lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to\nhigh inflation and tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $\n587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note\n1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors\nthan the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment\nrate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower\nthan the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2023\n2Q24       4Q24       2Q25\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2022\n2Q23       4Q23       2Q24\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.5  %     0.4  %       —  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated\nas the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from\nthe prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial\ninstruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business               Transaction Type                 Activity                        2023 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB                            Credit card securitization       Securitization of originated    pages 261–262\ntrusts                           credit card receivables\nServicing and securitization\nMortgage securitization        of both originated and           pages 262–264\ntrusts                         purchased residential\nmortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other               originated and purchased\nCIB                            securitization trusts            residential and commercial      pages 262–264\nmortgages, and other\nconsumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits          markets in a cost-efficient      page 264\nmanner and structuring\ntransactions to meet investor\nneeds\nMunicipal bond vehicles        Financing of municipal bond      pages 264–265\ninvestments\nThe Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a\nlesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is\ncompetitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to\nbe significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCommercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including\ncertain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of\nthese entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the\nentity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in\nthe same manner as any other third-party transaction.\nCorporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are\ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of\ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties\nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not\nhave the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these\nentities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nRefer to page 266 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily\nthrough the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain\nsenior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and\nliabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these\nsecuritization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing\nresponsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those\ntrusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other\ncontinuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm\nthe right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying\nsecuritized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of\nthe beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other\nobligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts\nrequire the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $\n4.9billion and $ 6.1billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal\nreceivables owned by those trusts of approximately 65%\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    261\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nand 62% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities\nand retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are\neliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has\nsecuritized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans\nprimarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective\nbusiness involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2023           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    58,570    $       675    $    39,319    $       595    $     1,981    $        60    $    2,636\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…          8,881              —          1,312              3              —              —             3\nCommer…\nand            168,042              —        120,262            831          5,638          1,354         7,823\nother(…\nTotal      $   235,493    $       675    $   160,893    $     1,429    $     7,619    $     1,414    $   10,462\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2022           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    55,362    $       754    $    37,058    $       744    $     1,918    $         —    $    2,662\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…          9,709              —          1,743             10              —              —            10\nCommer…\nand            164,915              —        127,037            888          5,373            670         6,931\nother(…\nTotal      $   229,986    $       754    $   165,838    $     1,642    $     7,291    $       670    $    9,603\n(a) Excludes U.S. GSEs and government agency securitizations and re-securitizations, which are not Firm-sponsored.\n(b) Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables.\n(c) Excludes the following: retained servicing; securities retained from loan sales and securitization activity\nrelated to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to\nmanage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities; senior securities of $ 52million and $\n134million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and subordinated securities were not material for both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.\n(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 77% and 84%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests,\nwhich are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 2.5billion and $ 2.6billion of investment-grade retained interests at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 88million and $ 27million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts\nconsisted of $ 6.1billion and $ 5.8billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $ 1.7billion and $\n1.1billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential\nmortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all\nresidential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For\nsecuritizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE\nbecause it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest\nupon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by\nFirm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests\n(including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in\nresidential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary\nmarket in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired\nby CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by\nCCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm does not\nconsolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the\nservicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not\nhold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Commercial mortgages\nand other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in\nunderwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold\nsenior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention\nrules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not\nservice commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well.\nFor commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held\nby the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not\nretain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Re-\nsecuritizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred\nto a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and\ngovernment agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is\nlargely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of\nsecurities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                   2023               2022               2021\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  18,864          $  16,128          $  53,923\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort\nand decisions in establishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the significant\neconomic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did\nnot transfer any private label securities to re-\nsecuritization VIEs during 2023, 2022 and 2021, and\nretained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial\ninterests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations\nand generally purchases these interests in the\nsecondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm\ndoes not have the unilateral ability to direct the\nmost significant activities of the re-securitization\ntrust, either because it was not involved in the\ninitial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved\nwith an independent third-party sponsor and\ndemonstrated shared power over the creation of the\ntrust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the\nre-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    263\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's\ninterests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                  Nonconsolidated\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies       re-securitization VIEs  2023              2022\nInterest in VIEs                     $                   3,371          $  2,580\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization\nVIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit\nentities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of\nreceivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities\nthrough the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is\nthe cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit\nenhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit\nenhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and\nare typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements\nmitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the\ncommercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the\nconduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a\nminimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities\nand program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit\nenhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of\ncommercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power\nto direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding\nasset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s\ninterests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and\nliquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity\nand credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 9.8billion and $ 13.8billion of the commercial paper\nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have been\neliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not\ndriven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,\nthe Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided\nby the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide\nlending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 10.8billion and $ 10.6billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as\noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for\nmore information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles\nor tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term\nrates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and\nfunds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2)\ninverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds\nor other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are\nretained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is\nheld by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are\ntransactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The\nFirm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may\nserve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing\nthe periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The\nremarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not\nmaterial during 2023 and 2022. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole\nliquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is\nconditional and is limited by certain events\n264    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\n(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal\nbond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the\nhigh credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain\ntransactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender,\ntheir floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another\ninvestor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the\nfloaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest\nentities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to\nmake decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the\nright to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLiabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,                                                                        intere…\n2023          Assets                                                            in\n(in          Trading                                           Total           VIE                        Total\nmilli…        assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…       assets…       Other(e)       liabil…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $   9,460          $      117    $     9,577    $    2,998    $         6    $    3,004\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             1       27,372                 194         27,567        17,781             30        17,811\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,056            —                  22          2,078         2,116             11         2,127\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          693                   8            701           125             57           182\nentit…\nOther            113           86                 250            449             —            159           159\nTotal     $    2,170    $  37,611          $      591    $    40,372    $   23,020    $       263    $   23,283\nAssets                                                       Liabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,          Trading                                           Total       intere…                        Total\n2022          assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…            in       Other(e)       liabil…\n(in                                                                            VIE\nmilli…                                                                     assets…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $   9,699          $      100    $     9,799    $    1,999    $         2    $    2,001\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             —       22,819                 170         22,989         9,236             39         9,275\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,089            —                   7          2,096         1,232             10         1,242\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          781                  10            791           143             67           210\nentit…\nOther             62        1,112    -f           263          1,437             —            161           161\nTotal     $    2,151    $  34,411          $      550    $    37,112    $   12,610    $       279    $   12,889\n(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities.

The holders of\nthese beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 3.1billion and $ 2.1billion at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(f) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    265\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,\nrepresented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 35.1billion and $ 30.2billion, of which $\n14.7billion and $ 10.6billion was unfunded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each\nproject and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project\nqualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28\nfor more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB\ntrusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the\nFirm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to\nprotect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not\nconsolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact\nthe economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to\ncustomer TOB trusts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 5.1billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value\nof assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 7.3billion and $ 8.2billion respectively. Loan\nsecuritizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card\nreceivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were\nto satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is\nnot required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale\nwhen all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally\nisolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the\ntransferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial\nassets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the\nability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for\nas a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received\n(including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold.\nGains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n266    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,                   2023       Commercial             2022       Commercial             2021       Commercial\n(in             Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and\nmillions)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)\nPrincipal    $       7,678    $       3,901    $      10,218    $       9,036    $      23,876    $      14,917\nsecuriti…\nAll cash\nflows\nduring\nthe\nperiod:(…\nProceeds\nreceived\nfrom loan    $       7,251    $       3,896    $       9,783    $       8,921    $      24,450    $      15,044\nsales as\nfinancial\ninstrume…\nServicing\nfees                    24                5               62                2              153                1\ncollected\nCash\nflows\nreceived               325              425              489              285              578              273\non\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser.

The goodwill\nimpairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying\nvalue. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not\nto be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the amount\nby which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a\nproxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit\nequity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a\nvariety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is\nreviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least\nannually and updated as needed. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units\nis the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth\nmethod to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units’\nannual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for\neach reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined\nconsidering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as\nadjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or\nuncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness\nof the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of\nequity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted\naverage cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost\nof equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with\nmarket-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are\nused as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise\nconclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and\ncompetitor institutions. The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of\nthe Firm’s reporting\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    269\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nunits and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several\nfactors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the\nlevel of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and\n(iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting\nunits. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting\nunits to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period\nrelated to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of\nexpected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated\nfuture servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines\nover time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual\nservicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or\nsecuritization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to\naccount for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the\navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one\naggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted\nspread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the\nFirm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to\nservice, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value\nestimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and\nactual portfolio experience.\n270    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs\ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase\nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.\nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is\nto offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related\nrisk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)                                                 2023              2022              2021\nFair value at beginning of period           $   7,973          $  5,494          $  3,276\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                              253               798             1,659\nPurchase of MSRs(a)                             1,028             1,400             1,363\nDisposition of MSRs(b)                           -188              -822              -114\nNet additions/(dispositions)                    1,093             1,376             2,908\nChanges due to collection/realization of       -1,011              -936              -788\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and          424             2,022               404\nother(c)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to               -22                14               109\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                     14                 —                 —\nPrepayment model changes and other(d)              51                 3              -415\nTotal changes in valuation due to other            43                17              -306\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs          467             2,039                98\nand assumptions\nFair value at December 31,                  $   8,522          $  7,973          $  5,494\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $     467          $  2,039          $     98\nat December 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and         1,590             1,535             1,298\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at            632               584               520\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at December            659               758             1,611\n31(e)\n(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid\nwithin 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.\n(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities\n(“SMBS”).

The estimated useful lives range from\n10to 50years for buildings and leasehold improvements,\nand 3to 10years for internal-use software and\nfurniture and equipment.\nImpairment is assessed when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset may not be fully recoverable.\nNote 17 – Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing deposits were as follows.\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nU.S. offices                                              2023                  2022\nNoninterest-bearing (included$75,393and     $    643,748          $    644,902\n$26,363at fair value)(a)\nInterest-bearing (included$573and $586at       1,303,100             1,276,346\nfair value)(a)\nTotal deposits in U.S. offices                 1,946,848             1,921,248\nNon-U.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing (included$1,737and            23,097                27,005\n$1,398at fair value)(a)\nInterest-bearing (included$681and $273at         430,743               391,926\nfair value)(a)\nTotal deposits in non-U.S. offices               453,840               418,931\nTotal deposits                              $  2,400,688          $  2,340,179\n(a) Includes structured notes classified as deposits\nfor which the fair value option has been elected.\nRefer to Note 3 for further discussion.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, time deposits in\ndenominations that met or exceeded the insured limit\nwere as follows.\nDecember 31, (in millions)                2023                2022\nU.S. offices                  $  132,654          $   64,622\nNon-U.S. offices(a)               90,187              77,907\nTotal                         $  222,841          $  142,529\n(a) Represents all time deposits in non-U.S. offices\nas these deposits typically exceed the insured limit.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining maturities of\ninterest-bearing time deposits were as follows.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)    U.S.                  Non-U.S.                 Total\n2024                     $  194,895                $  86,971             $  281,866\n2025                            742                      180                    922\n2026                            243                       21                    264\n2027                            140                       35                    175\n2028                            136                      992                  1,128\nAfter 5 years                   475                      251                    726\nTotal                    $  196,631                $  88,450             $  285,081\n274    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 18 - Leases\nFirm as lessee At December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of\nnoncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business\npurposes. These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the\nlease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain\nthat it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease\nliability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on\nthe Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease\nagreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on\nmaintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and\nnon-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent\npayments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the\nlease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The\nfuture lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for\nfinancing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating\nlease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus\ninitial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income.\nThe carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases\nwere as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted)\n2023                                                             2022\nRight-of-use assets                            $        8,431    -a      $        7,782\nLease liabilities                                       8,833    -b               8,183\nWeighted average remaining lease term                     8.4                       8.4\n(in years)\nWeighted average discount rate                    4.01      %               3.55      %\nSupplemental cash flow information\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities -             $        1,662            $        1,613\noperating cash flows\nSupplemental non-cash information\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange       $        2,094            $        1,435\nfor operating lease obligations\n(a) Included $ 647million of right-of-use assets\nassociated with First Republic.\n(b) Included $ 712million of lease liabilities\nassociated with First Republic.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                        2023            2022\nRental expense\nGross rental expense       $  2,079        $  2,079\nSublease rental income          -72            -119\nNet rental expense         $  2,007        $  1,960\nThe following table presents future payments under\noperating leases as of December 31, 2023:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2024                                         1,685\n2025                                         1,576\n2026                                         1,318\n2027                                         1,169\n2028                                         1,015\nAfter 2028                                   3,767\nTotal future minimum lease payments         10,530\nLess: Imputed interest                      -1,697\nTotal                                    $   8,833\nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31,\n2023, the Firm had additional future operating lease\ncommitments of $ 420million that were signed but had\nnot yet commenced.

The\nFirm’s lease financings are predominantly auto\noperating leases. These assets subject to operating\nleases are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the\nasset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation\nexpense is included in technology, communications and\nequipment expense in the Consolidated statements of\nincome. The Firm’s lease income is generally\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm and is included in other income in the\nConsolidated statements of income. On a periodic\nbasis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment,\nand if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds\nthe undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments\nand the estimated residual value upon disposition of\nthe leased asset, an impairment is recognized. The\nrisk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets\nrelating to the residual value of the leased assets is\nmonitored through projections of the asset residual\nvalues at lease origination and periodic review of\nresidual values, and is mitigated through arrangements\nwith certain manufacturers or lessees.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of\nassets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)                                      2023             2022\nCarrying value of assets subject to\noperating leases, net of accumulated    $  10,663        $  12,302\ndepreciation\nAccumulated depreciation                    3,288            4,282\nThe following table presents the Firm’s operating\nlease income and the related depreciation expense on\nthe Consolidated statements of income:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)              2023            2022            2021\nOperating lease income                   $  2,843        $  3,654        $  4,914\nDepreciation expense                        1,778           2,475           3,380\nThe following table presents future receipts under\noperating leases as of December 31, 2023:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2024                                        1,868\n2025                                        1,158\n2026                                          451\n2027                                           32\n2028                                            9\nAfter 2028                                      8\nTotal future minimum lease receipts      $  3,526\n276    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 19 – Accounts payable and other liabilities\nAccounts payable and other liabilities consist of brokerage payables, which include payables to customers and\npayables related to security purchases that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, such as compensation\naccruals, credit card rewards liability, operating lease liabilities, accrued interest payables, merchant servicing\npayables, income tax payables and litigation reserves.\nThe following table presents the components of accounts payable and other liabilities.\nDecember 31, (in millions)                       2023                2022\nBrokerage payables                   $  161,960          $  188,692\nOther payables and liabilities(a)       128,347             111,449\nTotal accounts payable and other     $  290,307          $  300,141\nliabilities\n(a) Includes credit card rewards liability of $ 13.2billion and $ 11.3billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe credit card rewards liability represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be\nredeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the\ncardholder redeems points.

The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $ 47.9billion and $\n45.3billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity,\nwhich may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.\n(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included\namounts accounted for at fair value which were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Excluded short-term\ncommercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $ 19.9billion and $ 10.5billion at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n(f) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the\nassociated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The interest rates shown\nexclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.\n(g) As of December 31, 2023, included $ 23.2billion of FHLB advances associated with First Republic. Refer to Note\n34 for additional information.\n(h) As of December 31, 2023, long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 208.2billion was redeemable at the option of\nJPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.\n(i) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2023 is $\n51.2billion in 2024, $ 53.5billion in 2025, $ 48.7billion in 2026, $ 26.2billion in 2027 and $ 79.0billion in 2028.\n278    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nThe weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for\nat fair value were 3.65% and 3.26% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In order to modify exposure to\ninterest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily\ninterest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of\nthese instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average\ninterest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.20% and\n4.89% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of\nits subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $ 41.1billion\nand $ 28.2billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain\nrequirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the\nexisting debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable\nchanges in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    279\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 21 – Preferred stock\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200million shares of preferred stock, in one\nor more series, with a par value of $ 1per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm,\nJPMorgan Chase’s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the\npayment of dividends and the distribution of assets.\nThe following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and the quarterly dividend declarations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nCo…\nra…\nin\nef…\nCa…                             at                         Di…\nva…                            De…       Ea…    Fl…        de…\n(in                     Is…    31,       re…    an…        per\nSh…              mi…                     da…    20…       da…    ra…        sh…\nYe…\nDe…              De…                     en…\n31,              31,                     De…\n31,\n20…    20…       20…       20…    20…    20…    20…\nF…\nS…      —      —    $    —    $    —           6/…      —  %    9/…    NA      $    —    $    —    $  30…\nAA\nS…      —      —         —         —           7/…      —       9/…    NA           —         —       30…\nBB\nS…    16…    16…       1,…       1,…           9/…    5.…       12…    NA         57…       57…       57…\nDD\nS…    18…    18…       1,…       1,…           1/…    6.…       3/…    NA         60…       60…       60…\nEE\nS…    90…    90…       900       900           11…    4.…       12…    NA         47…       47…       47…\nGG\nS…    15…    15…       1,…       1,…           3/…    4.…       6/…    NA         45…       45…       32…    -e\nJJ\nS…    18…    18…       1,…       1,…           5/…    4.…       6/…    NA         46…       46…       24…    -e\nLL\nS…    20…    20…       2,…       2,…           7/…    4.…       9/…    NA         42…       42…       14…    -e\nMM\nF…\nr…\nS…      —      —    $    —    $    —           4/…      —  %    4/…    —    %  $    —    $  37…    $  37…\nI\nS…    15…    15…       1,…       1,…           4/…    SO…       5/…    SO…        80…       51…       51…    -f\nQ                                                     +3…              +3…\nS…    15…    15…       1,…       1,…           7/…    SO…       8/…    SO…        75…       60…       60…    -g\nR                                                     +3…              +3…\nS…    20…    20…       2,…       2,…           1/…    6.…       2/…    SO…        67…       67…       67…\nS                                                                      +3…\nS…    10…    10…       1,…       1,…           3/…    6.…       4/…    SO…        61…       61…       61…\nU                                                                      +3…\nS…      —      —         —         —           6/…      —       7/…    —            —       34…       35…\nV\nS…    16…    16…       1,…       1,…           9/…    6.…       10…    SO…        61…       61…       61…\nX                                                                      +3…\nS…      —      —         —         —           4/…      —       5/…    —            —         —       40…\nZ\nS…    12…    12…       1,…       1,…           10…    SO…       11…    SO…        80…       52…       46…    -h\nCC                                                    +2…              +2…\nS…    22…    22…       2,…       2,…           7/…    5.…       8/…    SO…        50…       50…       50…\nFF                                                                     +3…\nS…    30…    30…       3,…       3,…           1/…    4.…       2/…    SO…        46…       46…       46…\nHH                                                                     +3…\nS…    15…    15…       1,…       1,…           2/…    4.…       4/…    SO…        40…       40…       40…\nII                                                                     +2…\nS…    20…    20…       2,…       2,…           5/…    3.…       6/…    CMT        36…       36…       20…    -e\nKK                                                                     +2…\nT…\np…    2,…    2,…    $  27…    $  27…\ns…\n(a) Represented by depositary shares.\n(b) Each series of fixed-to-floating rate preferred stock converts to a floating rate at the earliest redemption\ndate.\n(c) Effective June 30, 2023, CME Term SOFR became the replacement reference rate for fixed-to-floating rate\npreferred stock issued by the Firm that formerly referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR. References in the table to “SOFR”\nmean a floating annualized rate equal to three-month term SOFR (plus a spread adjustment of 0.26% per annum) plus\nthe spreads noted. The reference to “CMT” means a floating annualized rate equal to the five-year Constant Maturity\nTreasury (“CMT”) rate plus the spread noted.\n(d) Dividends on preferred stock are discretionary and non-cumulative.

Under the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated\nto common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan\nChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation\nprograms, predominantly all of which entitle\nrecipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends\npaid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These\nunvested RSUs meet the definition of participating\nsecurities based on their respective rights to receive\nnonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a\nseparate class of securities in computing basic EPS.\nParticipating securities are not included as\nincremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to\nNote 9 for additional information.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of\ncontingently issuable shares, including awards which\nrequire future service as a condition of delivery of\nthe underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated\nunder both the two-class and treasury stock methods,\nand the more dilutive amount is reported.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability method to provide\nfor income taxes on all transactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future\ntax consequences of temporary differences between the\ncarrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and\ntax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or\nliability for each temporary difference is determined\nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in\neffect when the underlying items of income and expense\nare realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred portions of\nthat expense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits are certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These unrecognized\nitems include the tax effect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state and local\nunrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the\nbenefit from associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.\nunrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in\nother jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need\nfor changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its\nanticipated tax return filing positions as part of its\nU.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In\naddition, the Firm is presently under audit by a\nnumber of taxing authorities, most notably by the\nInternal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax\nexamination status table below. The evaluation of\nunrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for\naudit settlements make it reasonably possible that\nover the next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by\nas much as approximately $ 1.1billion.

The business of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination\nand regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the\nU.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the\nU.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable\nlimits. The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves\nat certain non-US central banks. The Firm is also\nsubject to rules and regulations established by other\nU.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its\ncompliance with the respective regulatory\nrequirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are\nsubject to certain restrictions on cash and other\nassets.\nThe following table presents the components of the\nFirm’s restricted cash:\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nSegregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers         10.3           18.7\nCash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes        9.3  2023      8.1  2022\nTotal restricted cash(a)                                                       $  19.6        $  26.8\n(a) Comprises $ 18.2billion and $ 25.4billion in\ndeposits with banks, and $ 1.4billion and $ 1.4billion\nin cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had the following other restricted assets: • Cash and securities\npledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $ 40.5billion and $ 42.4billion, respectively.\nSecurities with a fair value of $ 20.5billion and $ 31.7billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation\nto customer activity.\nIntercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its\nsubsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the\nloans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company\nor to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred\nto as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are\ngenerally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital\nguidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates\nis limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC\ngenerally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent\nCompany is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal\nsources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and\nextensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit\nor to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and\nits subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking\norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain\ncapital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s\nmanagement or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2024, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the\naggregate, approximately $ 20billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior\napproval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2024 will be supplemented by the\nbanking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.\n288    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 27 – Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding\ncompanies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III\nAdvanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as\nillustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan\nChase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and\nthe SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-\nrelated commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13\nfor further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments . The following\ntable summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.\nThe Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will\nbe utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower\nnotice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card\nlines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant\ndecreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    291\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nO…\ns…\nl…\nf…\ni…\ng…\na…\no…\nc…\nBy\nr…\nm…\nas\nof\nD…       Co…\n3…       am…\n(…       20…         Ex…         Ex…\nm…       Ex…         af…         af…\nL…        in           1           3\nC…         1         ye…         ye…         Ex…\ne…       ye…         th…         th…         af…                                     Ca…\nc…        or           3           5           5                       20…           va…\nc…       le…         ye…         ye…         ye…         To…           To…           20…              20…\nR…\nR…    $  6,…      $  7,…      $  6,…      $  9,…      $  30…        $  21…           678    -j         75\nE…\nA…\na…       12…         159           —         2,…         15…           12…           148    -j          —\no…\nT…\nc…\ne…       19…         7,…         6,…         12…         45…           33…           826               75\nc…\nc…\nC…       91…           —           —           —         91…           82…             —                —\nc…\nT…       93…         7,…         6,…         12…         96…           85…           826               75\nc…\nW…\nO…\nu…\nc…       12…         17…         17…         23…         50…           44…           2,…    -j…       2,…    -k\nto\ne…\nc…\nS…\nl…\nof\nc…       13…         10…         3,…         991         28…           27…           479              408\na…\no…\nf…\ng…\nO…\nl…       4,…         222          82           —         4,…           4,…            37                6\nof\nc…\nT…       14…         18…         18…         24…         53…           47…           3,…              2,…\nw…\nT…    $  1,…      $  19…      $  18…      $  37…      $  1,…        $  1,…        $  4,…           $  2,…\nl…\nO…\ng…\na…\nc…\nS…\nl…\ni…    $  28…      $    —      $    —      $    —      $  28…        $  28…        $    —           $    —\na…\na…\ng…\nD…\nq…       1,…         364         11…         40…         54…           59…            89              649\nas\ng…\nU…\nr…\na…       94…         186           —           —         95…           11…             —               -2\ns…\nb…\na…\nU…\nr…\na…       60…         554           —           —         60…           66…             —               -7\ns…\nl…\na…\nL…\ns…\na…\ns…\ni…\nM…\nr…            NA          NA          NA          NA          NA            NA        76               76\nl…\nL…\ns…            NA          NA          NA          NA     803           820            24               28\nw…\nr…\nE…\n&\nc…\nh…       26…           —           —           —         26…           19…             —                —\ng…\na…\nc…\nO…\ng…       9,…         1,…         314         4,…         15…           8,…            38               53\na…\nc…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $\n88million and $ 71million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 8.2billion at both\nperiods for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $ 589million and $ 512million,\nrespectively, for other letters of credit.

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount\nequal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a\ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform\nunder a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and\nthe guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of\nconsideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records\nthis fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation\nis recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any\nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds\nis allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For\nthese indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time\nor when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications\nare included in the table on page 292. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2023                                              2022\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of\ncredit and                                        credit and\nDecember 31,    other                                             other                                   Other\n(in             financial                        Other letters    financial                             letters\nmillions)       guarantees                           of credit    guarantees                          of credit\nInvestment-…                     $  19,694    $          3,552                     $  19,205    $         3,040\nNoninvestme…                         9,178                 836                         8,234              1,094\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  28,872    $          4,388                     $  27,439    $         4,134\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $     110    $             37                     $      82    $             6\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              369                   —                           326                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     479    $             37                     $     408    $             6\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  16,861    $            539                     $  15,296    $           795\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    293\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via\ncustodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides\nan indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to\nreturn the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash\nor other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from\nthe borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional\ncollateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the\nevent of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent\nthereof. The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale\nagreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its\nliability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal\ninvested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm\nto purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The\nFirm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The\nterms of written put options are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes\nstable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of\nthe difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the\nevent that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products\nare transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected\nportfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to\nterminate the contract under certain conditions. The notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents\nthe Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a\nsubstantially lower percentage of the notional amount. The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the\nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm\nreduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that\nhedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\n(in millions)                                      December 31, 2023               December 31, 2022\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  54,562                       $  59,180\nStable value contracts with                32,488                          31,820\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        1,652                           2,063\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                            89                             649\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal course\nof business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty.\nThe Firm also enters into repurchase and securities\nloaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the counterparty. Such\nagreements settle at a future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets until settlement date. These agreements\npredominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer\nto Note 11 for a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-\nrelated indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has\nmade representations and warranties that the loans\nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require\nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify\nthe loan purchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations\nis separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing\nits litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products on\nboth a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse\nservicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is\nthe cost of temporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse\nservicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk\nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie\nMae\n294    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when\nforeclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding\nprincipal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying\nproperty. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of\nfuture credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal\nbalance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of\nthe Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the\ntable on page 292. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with\nissuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of\nthe securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on\npayments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities\nif such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the\nlicensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party\n(“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages\nthat may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due\nto actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s\nmaximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes\nin tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on\nhistorical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of\npayment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-\nback to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s\nissuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.\nIf the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited\nor refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers\nthe payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nFirm processed an aggregate volume of $ 2,411.0billion, $ 2,158.4billion, and $ 1,886.7billion, respectively.\nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities\npurchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects\ncash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them\nto the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a\ndaily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a\nderivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the\ncontract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable\nto clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client\nthrough the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions.\nThe Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the\nclearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and\naccess available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining\nshortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance\nrisk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the\nclients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member,\nas this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon\nhistorical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that\nthe Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be\nremote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records\nin its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    295\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and\nclearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership\nin some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization\nas a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations\nmay be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund\nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a\nmember default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata\nshare of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial\nmargin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required\nshould such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb\nthe losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible\nexposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is\ndisclosed in the table on page 292, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored\nmember repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf\nof clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt\nand full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-\nquality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk\nof loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 292. Refer to Note\n11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral\npledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent\nCompany may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the\nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet\ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees\nis remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by\nJPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company\nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, are not included in the table on page 292 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\n296    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that\nit owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at\ndiscount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various\nother central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s pledged\nassets.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                              2023              2022\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $    145.0          $  110.8\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged         244.2             114.8\nor otherwise used by secured parties(a)\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks          675.6             567.6\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  1,064.8          $  793.2\n(a) As of December 31, 2023, included $ 88.4billion of\nassets pledged to the FDIC associated with the First\nRepublic acquisition.

This collateral is generally\nobtained under resale and other securities financing\nagreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-\ninvestment customer receivables and derivative\ncontracts.

The litigations range from individual actions\ninvolving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations\nand regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and\nself-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of\nclaims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.3billion at December 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was\nbased upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate\nof reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can\nbe made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves\nsignificant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that\nmany are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the\nFirm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of\nthe proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions\nconcerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties\nor regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a\ndefendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian\nstate-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)\nSA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB\nand paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company\nbetween 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of service and the\nMalaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 1MDB to\ndiscontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August\n2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm\nseeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney\nGeneral (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible\ncriminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the\n1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG\ninvestigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by\nJPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to\ndelays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July\n2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated\ncertain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry.\nThe Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The\nFirm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”)\nsales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the\nFirm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the\nFirm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under\n298    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the\nantitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter\nwhich is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters,\nin a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties\nwho purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class\nand granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the\nDistrict Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on\nsimilar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the\nNetherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In\nJuly 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for\nclass certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative\nclass action, which remains subject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm\nis responding to inquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to\ntransfers of funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to\nrequests for information. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of\nclass action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018,\nthe parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing\napproximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. Based on\nthe percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from\nthe settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the\nDistrict Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the\nmerchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions\nremain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately\n70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex\ntrafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June 2023, the Court\ngranted preliminary approval of a settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to\nwhich JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $ 290million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In November 2023, the Court\ngranted final approval of the settlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain state Attorneys General,\nregarding the victims’ releases. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the\nBritish Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the\nEuropean Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s\ninvestigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm\nappealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled\nthe fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical\namount. The Firm is considering its options. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other\nbanks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained\ndismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.\nThe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust\nclaims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a\nlawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other\ndefendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market\nfor LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the\ndismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all\nnon-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions\nlaws, which mandate the freezing or restriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with\nindividuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and\nthreatened litigation in Russia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is contractually\nexcused from paying, under relevant sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in one claim in February\n2024. The Russian court may\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    299\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\ndisregard the parties’ contractual agreement on forum selection, and may not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a\nbasis for not making payment. The Firm holds assets in Russia, which could be seized if the claims are granted and\nenforced. SEC Inquiries . The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory\nprograms within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory\nfees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection\nwith the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest\nin third-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities\nLending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and\nJ.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal\nantitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of\nanonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has\nbeen preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder\nputative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have\nbeen filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of\nthese shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S.\ntreasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC\nin September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court\nof the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to\nthe historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the\nresolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full,\nand in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the\nhistorical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims\nand alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would\nhave been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action\nis pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who\nacquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings\nof the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the\nhistorical trading practices and conduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the\namended complaint. A shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York against various officers and directors of the Firm asserting breaches of fiduciary\nduty and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm to retain Jeffrey Epstein as\na client of the bank after defendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was using the Firm’s financial\nservices to facilitate his alleged sex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court dismissed the derivative\naction. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based\non the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with\nrecords preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries\nand the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. Trading Venues\nInvestigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading\nvenues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified\nthat certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm\nhas completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is\nunderway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and\nhas not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a\nfraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored\nclient access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously\nenhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S.\nregulators that will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent\nconsultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $ 350million. The Firm is also in advanced\nnegotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there is no assurance that such discussions will result in a\nresolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions. * * *\n300    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it\nintends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance\nwith the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments\nin such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with\ncounsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 1.4billion, $ 266million and $ 426million for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be\nadjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase\nbelieves, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal\nproceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of\nthe uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters\nwill not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material\nreputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s\noperating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability\nimposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    301\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 31 – International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major\ninternational geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation\nas business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is\nbased predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed,\nbooking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve\ninternational businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have\nbeen made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and\nassumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The\nFirm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation\nto total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for\nthe year\nended\nDecember 31,                                            Income before\n(in millions)                                              income tax\n2023                Revenue(c)       Expense(d)               expense       Net income       Total assets\nEurope/Middle    $      20,974    $      11,947    $            9,027    $       6,402    $       529,335    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific            10,605            6,550                 4,055            2,709            251,588\nLatin                    3,294            1,971                 1,323              994             83,003\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   34,873           20,468                14,405           10,105            863,926\ninternational\nNorth                  123,231           76,024                47,207           39,447          3,011,467\nAmerica(a)(b)\nTotal            $     158,104    $      96,492    $           61,612    $      49,552    $     3,875,393\n2022\nEurope/Middle    $      18,765    $      11,754    $            7,011    $       5,158    $       558,430    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific            10,025            6,763                 3,262            2,119            281,479\nLatin                    3,178            1,697                 1,481            1,156             78,673\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   31,968           20,214                11,754            8,433            918,582\ninternational\nNorth                   96,727           62,315                34,412           29,243          2,747,161\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     128,695    $      82,529    $           46,166    $      37,676    $     3,665,743\n2021\nEurope/Middle    $      16,561    $      10,833    $            5,728    $       4,202    $       517,904    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific             9,654            6,372                 3,282            2,300            277,897\nLatin                    2,756            1,589                 1,167              878             65,040\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   28,971           18,794                10,177            7,380            860,841\ninternational\nNorth                   92,678           43,293                49,385           40,954          2,882,726\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     121,649    $      62,087    $           59,562    $      48,334    $     3,743,567\n(a) Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b) Includes the impact of First Republic.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within\nincome tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or\nby the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety\nof factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is\nmeasured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s\nperformance. The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB\nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment.\nAt least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a\nresult, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.\nSegment results and reconciliation (a)\n304    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\n…\n…                                        …                                       …\n…       …                …               …       …                …               …      …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  …     $  …            $  …              …    $         …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               —        —               —              …              …\n…        …               …               —        —               —              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —              …    $         …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —              …    $         …\n…        …               …                  …        …               …           …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …           …         %    …\n…        …               …               …        …               …           …              …\n(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact\nrecorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

The Firm\nbelieves that the First Republic acquisition is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. The acquisition\nresulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net\nassets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business\ncombination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nwere generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values\nrequired management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and\nother valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase\ngain. The Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the\nidentification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this\nsettlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption\nagreement entered into with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date.\nIn addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's\nfinalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. The First\nRepublic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The Firm has\ncontinued to progress in the settlement process with the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value estimates.\nAs a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, adjustments totaling $ 63million were made, increasing the\nestimated bargain purchase gain to $ 2.8billion. In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and\nthe FDIC entered into twoshared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the\n\"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement\n(“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5years with a subsequent\n3-yearrecovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of\ncredit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property\nor shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the\nfair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of\nthe consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase\nMoney Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the\nacquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion\ndeposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of\nlarge U.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the\nassociated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $\n25billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9,\n2023.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    307\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below, and\nreflect the adjustments made through December 31, 2023 to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets\nacquired.\nFair value purchase\nprice allocation as of\nMay 1, 2023\n(in millions)\nPurchase price consideration\nAmounts paid/due to the FDIC, net of cash          $                  13,524\nacquired(a)\nPurchase Money Note (at fair value)                                   48,848\nSettlement of First Republic deposit and other                         5,447\nrelated party transactions(b)\nContingent consideration - Shared-loss                                    15\nagreements\nPurchase price consideration                       $                  67,834\nAssets\nSecurities                                         $                  30,285\nLoans(c)                                                             153,242\nCore deposit and customer relationship                                 1,455\nintangibles\nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements                          675\nAccounts receivable and other assets(c)(d)                             6,574\nTotal assets acquired                              $                 192,231\nLiabilities\nDeposits                                           $                  87,572\nFHLB advances                                                         27,919\nLending-related commitments                                            2,614\nAccounts payable and other liabilities(c)(d)                           2,793\nDeferred tax liabilities                                                 724\nTotal liabilities assumed                          $                 121,622\nFair value of net assets acquired                  $                  70,609\nEstimated gain on acquisition, after-tax           $                   2,775\n(a) Includes $ 10.6billion of cash paid to the FDIC at acquisition and $ 3.6billion payable to the FDIC, less cash\nacquired of $ 680million.\n(b) Includes $ 447million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively\nsettled on the acquisition date.\n(c) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $ 762million increase to\nloans, an $ 870million decrease to accounts receivable and other assets and a $ 30million increase to accounts\npayable and other liabilities.\n(d) Other assets include $ 1.2billion in tax-oriented investments and $ 683million of lease right-of-use assets.\nOther liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 669million and lease liabilities of\n$ 748million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 18 for additional information.\nThe issuance of the $ 50billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5billion deposit and\n$ 447million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.6billion payable to the FDIC as part of\nthe purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.\nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the\nfollowing assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss\nagreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.\nFor further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Note 2 and Note 3\nfor fair value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28\nfor lending-related commitments.\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship\nintangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit intangible of $ 1.3billion\nwas valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the\nfavorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the\ncost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available\nto market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated\nafter-tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible\nasset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair\nvalues, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the\nrelationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a\nprojected period of future cash flows of approximately 7years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other\nintangible assets. Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted\nrecoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods.\nThe indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other\n308    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nassets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets\nwere estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The\nsubsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of\nforecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in\nother income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination\nof the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The\nestimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price\nconsideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash\nflow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are\nrecorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates.\nLoans\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and estimated fair values of the loans acquired\nas of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired through\nDecember 31, 2023.\nMay 1, 2023\n(in millions)                         UPB       Fair value\nResidential real estate    $      106,240    $      92,053\nAuto and other                      3,093            2,030\nTotal consumer                    109,333           94,083\nSecured by real estate             37,117           33,602\nCommercial & industrial             4,332            3,932\nOther(a)                           23,499           21,625\nTotal wholesale                    64,948           59,159\nTotal loans                $      174,281    $     153,242\n(a) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $ 900million increase to\nthe UPB and a $ 762million increase to the fair value of Other wholesale loans.\nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\nIncluded in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net\nincome contributed by First Republic of $ 4.4billion, $ 3.7billion and $ 4.1billion, respectively, for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the\nestimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2billion.

table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between\nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in\nthe table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 310-313 for more information on average balances and\nrates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated\nseparately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net\nspread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result,\nchanges in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result,\nand due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended               2023 versus\nDecember 31,                    2022                                 2022 versus 2021\n(On a                Increase/(decr…                                 Increase/(decre…\ntaxable-equiv…         due to change                                    due to change\nbasis; in                        in:                       Net                    in:                       Net\nmillions)                     Volume         Rate       change                 Volume         Rate       change\nInterest-earn…\nassets\nDeposits with\nbanks:\nU.S.              $           -8,225    $  16,155    $   7,930    $            -1,185    $   7,910    $   6,725\nNon-U.S.                        -361        5,189        4,828                    166        1,636        1,802\nFederal funds\nsold and\nsecurities\npurchased\nunder resale\nagreements:\nU.S.                           1,347        4,792        6,139                    267        1,625        1,892\nNon-U.S.                        -629        4,937        4,308                    311        1,471        1,782\nSecurities\nborrowed:\nU.S.                            -411        4,839        4,428                     64        2,066        2,130\nNon-U.S.                         -95        1,413        1,318                     69          423          492\nTrading assets\n– debt\ninstruments:\nU.S.                           3,358        1,949        5,307                    375        1,509        1,884\nNon-U.S.                         666          931        1,597                   -418          775          357\nInvestment\nsecurities:\nU.S.                          -1,690        8,165        6,475                  1,061        2,534        3,595\nNon-U.S.                         228          651          879                     -2          207          205\nLoans:\nU.S.                          10,296       17,635       27,931                  2,988        6,750        9,738\nNon-U.S.                        -258        3,039        2,781                    148        1,328        1,476\nAll other\ninterest-earn…\nassets,                       -3,749        7,655        3,906                    161        2,708        2,869\npredominantly\nU.S.\nChange in\ninterest                         477       77,350       77,827                  4,005       30,942       34,947\nincome\nInterest-bear…\nliabilities\nInterest-bear…\ndeposits:\nU.S.                          -1,284       20,511       19,227                    268        5,857        6,125\nNon-U.S.                         597       10,110       10,707                    161        3,265        3,426\nFederal funds\npurchased and\nsecurities\nloaned or sold\nunder\nrepurchase\nagreements:\nU.S.                           1,293        6,263        7,556                   -466        3,327        2,861\nNon-U.S.                        -480        2,462        1,982                     93          493          586\nTrading\nliabilities –\ndebt,\nshort-term\nand all other\ninterest-bear…\nliabilities:\nU.S.                             409        4,981        5,390                    206        2,523        2,729\nNon-U.S.                         -17        1,924        1,907                    125          756          881\nBeneficial\ninterests\nissued by\nconsolidated                     381          346          727                    -69          212          143\nVIEs,\npredominantly\nU.S.\nLong-term\ndebt:\nU.S.                           2,494        5,229        7,723                     75        3,722        3,797\nNon-U.S.                          -3            8            5                    -31           27           -4\nChange in\ninterest                       3,390       51,834       55,224                    362       20,182       20,544\nexpense\nChange in net\ninterest          $           -2,913    $  25,516    $  22,603    $             3,643    $  10,760    $  14,403\nincome\n314    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K\nGlossary of Terms and Acronyms\n2022 Form 10-K: Annual report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\nABS: Asset-backed securities\nAFS: Available-for-sale\nALCO: Asset Liability Committee\nAmortized cost: Amount at which a financing receivable\nor investment is originated or acquired, adjusted for\naccretion or amortization of premium, discount, and\nnet deferred fees or costs, collection of cash,\ncharge-offs, foreign exchange, and fair value hedge\naccounting adjustments.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans\nare subject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting\nspecified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good\ncredit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

The\nFirm maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion\nand respect, which is reinforced by its Code of\nConduct and by increasing employee awareness,\neducation, communication and training. An important\npart of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business\nResource Groups, which are groups of employees who\nsupport JPMorgan Chase’s diversity, equity and\ninclusion strategies by leveraging the unique\nperspectives of their members. The Firm has global\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence\nthat lead the Firm’s strategy in supporting its\ncommitments to create more equity and lasting impact\nin communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture.\nAttracting and retaining employees\nThe goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to\nattract and hire talented individuals in all roles and\nat all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both\nexternal candidates and internal employees who are\nseeking a different role with challenging and\nstimulating career opportunities. These opportunities\nrange from internship training programs for students\nto entry-level, management and executive careers.\nDuring 2023, approximately 60% of the Firm’s\nemployment opportunities were filled by external\ncandidates, with the remainder filled by existing\nemployees. In addition, depending on business needs,\nand where appropriate, the Firm continues to employ\nhybrid work models which include a mix of on-site and\nremote work for certain roles.\nAttracting talent with diverse backgrounds and\nperspectives is an important area of focus throughout\nthe Firm’s recruitment process. JPMorgan Chase sources\ntalent by engaging in efforts aimed at building and\nfostering an inclusive work environment. The Firm’s\nglobal Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of\nexcellence support its diversity, equity and inclusion\nstrategies through initiatives such as career coaching\nand mentorship.\nJPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program\nthat seeks to attract accomplished individuals who\nhave taken a career break and wish to return to the\nworkforce. In addition, and where appropriate, the\nFirm’s hiring practices focus on the skills of a job\ncandidate rather than degrees held.\nDeveloping employees\nJPMorgan Chase supports the professional development\nand career growth of its employees. An onboarding\ntraining curriculum is required for new hires which\ncovers, among other topics, compliance with the Firm’s\nCode of Conduct and information concerning Firm\npolicies and standards, including those relating to\ncybersecurity. In addition, the Firm offers extensive\ntraining programs and educational resources to all\nemployees covering a broad variety of topics such as\nleadership, change management, analytical thinking,\nculture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion,\nand risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm’s\nglobal leadership and management development center of\nexcellence, is focused on creating one Firmwide\nleadership culture.\nCompensation and benefits\nThe Firm provides market-competitive compensation and\nbenefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation\nphilosophy includes guiding principles that drive\ncompensation-related decisions across the Firm, and\nincludes: pay-for-performance practices designed to\nattract and retain top talent; responsiveness and\nalignment with shareholder interests; and\nreinforcement of the Firm’s culture and Business\nPrinciples. The Firm follows a disciplined and\nbalanced compensation framework, including the\nintegration of risk, controls and conduct\nconsiderations. The Firm’s compensation review\nprocesses seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are\npaid equitably and competitively for the work they do.\nJPMorgan Chase offers extensive benefits and wellness\npackages to support employees and their families,\nwhich vary depending on location and include\nhealthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and\ndisability insurance, access to on-site health and\nwellness centers, counseling and resources related to\nmental health, competitive vacation and leave\npolicies, child care access and support, tuition\nreimbursement programs, and financial coaching. In\n2023, the Firm further enhanced its health and\nwellness benefits for U.S. employees, including\nupdates to the U.S. medical plan, as well as expedited\naccess to an expanded network of professionals for\nfree mental health counseling and coaching.\n3",

          "content": "Part I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well\nas the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a\nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding\ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject\nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The\nFederal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the\nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan\nChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by\nadditional authorities based on the activities or\nlicenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and,\nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and regulated by the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc holds a banking license in the\nU.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential\nRegulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated\nby the European Central Bank (“ECB”) as well as the\nlocal regulators in each of the countries in which it\noperates. The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are\nregulated by the banking, securities, prudential,\npayments and conduct regulatory authorities, as\napplicable, in the countries in which they operate.\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business\nactivities other than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted\nto engage in a broader range of financial activities.\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nactivities if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also\nimpose corrective capital and/or managerial\nrequirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are\npersistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s\ndepository institutions. If any depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory\nrating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the\nFederal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its\nsubsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other\nthan\nthose permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries\nand branches are also subject to local capital and\nliquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators\nreleased a proposal to amend the U.S. risk-based\ncapital framework to incorporate certain elements of\nthe revised international Basel III capital framework.\nThe proposal would significantly revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S.\nglobal systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). The\nproposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three-\nyear transition period.\nIn addition to the release of the U.S. proposal, the\nEU and U.K. regulators have also largely finalized the\nrules implementing their Basel III frameworks. The\nproposed effective dates are January 1, 2025, in the\nEU and July 1, 2025, in the U.K., with certain\ntransitional arrangements applicable until 2030 and\n2032, respectively.\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an\nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking\ninto account the results of separate stress tests\ndesigned by each of the Firm and the Federal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve uses the results under the\nseverely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress\ntest to determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer\n(“SCB”) requirement for the coming year, which forms\npart of the Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The\nFirm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on\nApril 5, 2024. The Federal Reserve will notify the\nFirm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30,\n2024 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024. The\nFirm’s final SCB requirement will become effective on\nOctober 1, 2024. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests\nannually. The Firm publishes each year the results of\nthe annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely\nadverse” scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for more\ninformation.\n4\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate\nto identify and monitor risks to the financial\nstability of the U.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and\nreporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial institutions\n(“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve\nhas adopted several rules to implement those\nheightened prudential standards, including rules\nrelating to risk management and corporate governance\nof subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under\nthese rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and\noverall risk management standards, including oversight\nby the board of directors of risk management\nactivities.\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nmaintain a comprehensive recovery plan, which is\nupdated annually and which summarizes the actions that\nit would take to remain well-capitalized and well-\nfunded in order to avoid failure in the case of an\nadverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nis required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as\ndirected by the OCC. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank\nAct”), the Firm is required to submit periodically to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution\n(a “resolution plan”) under the Bankruptcy Code in the\nevent of material distress or failure. Under rules\nadopted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, the\nFirm’s resolution plan submissions under the Dodd-\nFrank Act alternate between “targeted” and “full”\nplans. The Firm’s most recent “full” resolution plan\nwas filed on June 30, 2023, and the Firm's next\n\"targeted\" resolution plan is due to be filed on or\nbefore July 1, 2025. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also\nrequired to prepare and submit a separate resolution\nplan pursuant to a separate FDIC regulation that\nrequires FDIC-insured depository institutions over a\ncertain asset threshold to prepare a resolution plan\nto facilitate their resolution by the FDIC under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act (the “IDI Resolution\nRule”). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. most recently filed\na resolution plan pursuant to the IDI Resolution Rule\non December 1, 2023.\nIn August 2023, the FDIC released a proposal to revise\nthe IDI Resolution Rule. For FDIC-insured depository\ninstitutions with $100 billion or more in total\nassets, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nproposal would revise the content requirements for\nresolution plan submissions, increase the frequency of\nresolution plan submissions to every two years\n(instead of the current three-year cycle) and require\nthe filing of interim supplements in non-submission\nyears. The proposal would also enhance how the FDIC\nassesses the credibility of resolution plan\nsubmissions, expand the FDIC’s expectations regarding\nbank engagement with FDIC staff and capabilities\ntesting, and outline expectations regarding the FDIC’s\nreview and enforcement of compliance with the IDI\nRule.\nCertain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and\nbranches are also subject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its\nsubsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution\nunder the “orderly liquidation authority” rather than\nunder the Bankruptcy Code. In order to invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, the U.S. Treasury\nSecretary, in consultation with the President of the\nUnited States, must first make certain determinations\nconcerning extraordinary financial distress and\nsystemic risk, and action must be recommended by the\nFDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the\nFirm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution\nunder the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft\npolicy statement describing its “single point of\nentry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the\norderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep\noperating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses\non shareholders and creditors of the BHC in\nreceivership according to their statutory order of\npriority.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the\nFederal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and\ntheir banks are subject to requirements, limitations\nand prohibitions established by law and by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are\nrequired to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares\nof an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by\nfinancial companies are generally prohibited if, as a\nresult of the acquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies, as determined\nunder Federal Reserve regulations. Furthermore, for\ncertain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written\nnotice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring\ndirect or indirect ownership or control of any voting\nshares of any company with over $10 billion in assets\nthat is engaged in activities that are “financial in\nnature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader\nrange of activities (including acquisitions) than\nBHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to limit\nan FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nacquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements.\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to a\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the\nDepartment of Justice on September 29, 2020, relating\nto precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets\ninvestigations, as well as a cooperation obligation\nunder a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those\nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n5",

The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on banks, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC is required to\nmaintain a minimum reserve ratio, which measures the\nbalance of reserves in the deposit insurance fund\nagainst an estimate of FDIC-insured deposits, of\n1.35%. The reserve ratio is currently below the\nstatutory minimum and, in October 2022, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule to raise bank assessments and\naccelerate the time by which the reserve ratio would\nmeet the statutory minimum. As a result, the FDIC has\nadopted a restoration plan to bring the reserve ratio\nup to the required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a\nlonger-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio of\n2%.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad\npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the\napproval of the institution’s creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to a depository\ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the\nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the\nundercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In\ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration\nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nHeightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the OCC\nhas established guidelines setting forth heightened\nstandards for large banks, including minimum standards\nfor the design and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s\nrisk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s\nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from\nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.\nThe bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for\napproving the bank’s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking\nactivities, and holding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance framework.\nThe Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. are\nsubject to supervisory expectations published by the\nECB and the PRA, respectively, addressing bank\nstrategy, governance and risk management in the areas\nof climate change, operational resilience, reliance on\nIT systems and third-party services, and resilience\nfrom macro-financial and geopolitical shocks. Further,\nthe EU requires that certain non-EU banking groups\noperating in the EU establish\nan intermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in\nthe EU or, with ECB approval, two IPUs if a single IPU\nwould conflict with “home country” bank separation\nrules or impede resolvability. The Firm was granted\napproval by the ECB in May 2023 to have two IPUs,\nwhich will hold the Firm’s EU banks and broker-\ndealers.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of\ncredit to, investments in stock or securities of, and\nderivatives, securities lending and certain other\ntransactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain\nother affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries unless\nthe loans are secured in specified amounts and comply\nwith certain other requirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations\non the payment of dividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the\namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\ncould pay, at January 1, 2024, to JPMorgan Chase\nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The\nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank\nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of\nthe financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of\na receiver of an insured depositary institution\n(“IDI”) for administrative expense and the claims of\nholders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the\nFDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually\npayable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have\npriority over the claims of other unsecured creditors\nof the institution, including depositors in non-U.S.\nbranches and public noteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation in the U.S. by the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to\nfederal consumer protection laws, including laws\nrelating to fair lending and the prohibition of\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in\nconnection with the offer, sale or provision of\nconsumer financial products and services. The CFPB\nalso has jurisdiction over small business lending\nactivities with respect to fair lending and the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory\noversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement\nactions against firms that offer certain products and\nservices to consumers using practices that are deemed\nto be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February 2023,\nthe CFPB proposed a rule that would significantly\nreduce and limit the late payment fees that credit\ncard issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted\nto charge to customers. In January 2024, the CFPB\nproposed a rule that could significantly restrict bank\noverdraft fees for certain insured depository\ninstitutions, including the Firm. The proposal would\nimpose certain requirements on overdraft\n6\nprotections, similar to those that apply to credit\ncards, unless the financial institution prices the\noverdraft fee at the institution’s cost to provide the\nproduct or at a benchmark determined by the CFPB . In\nOctober 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed to\nlower the maximum interchange fee that large debit\ncard issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted\nto receive for a debit card transaction. The proposal\nwould also establish a process for automatically\npublishing an updated maximum fee amount every other\nyear going forward. The Firm’s consumer activities are\nalso subject to regulation under state statutes which\nare enforced by the Attorney General or empowered\nagency of each state.\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through\nJ.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides\nretail investment management services through Nutmeg\nSaving and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is\nregulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are\nregulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of\nfinancial services in the U.K., including obligations\nrelating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is\nalso regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator\nwith respect to its operation and use of payment\nsystems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL\nand Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection\nlegislation. The Consumer Duty in the U.K. became\neffective in July 2023 for U.K.-regulated financial\nservice providers, and encompasses requirements on the\ntypes of products and services that should be offered\nto consumers, how to balance value and pricing for\nconsumers as well as how to promote good consumer\nunderstanding and post-sale support to consumers.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and\nbrokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations\nof the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange,\namong others. The Firm conducts similar securities\nactivities outside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities\nare primarily conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc\nand in the EU, those activities are primarily\nconducted by JPMSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws\nand regulations covering all aspects of the securities\nbusiness, including sales and trading practices,\nsecurities offerings, publication of research reports,\nuse of customer funds, the financing of client\npurchases, capital structure, record-keeping and\nretention, and the conduct of their directors,\nofficers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer\nregulatory capital on page 101 for information\nconcerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nand J.P. Morgan Securities plc. In addition, the\nFirm's sales and trading activities, which are\nconducted through both bank and non-bank subsidiaries,\nare subject to laws and regulations relating to market\nconduct, including prohibitions on manipulative or\nanti-competitive practices.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are\nsubject to significant regulation in jurisdictions\naround the world relating to, among other things, the\nsafeguarding and management of client assets,\nofferings of funds and marketing activities. Certain\nof the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and\nsubject to oversight by, the SEC as investment\nadvisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered\ninvestment advisers in the U.S. are subject to the\nfiduciary and other obligations imposed under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state\nand federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities\nare subject to supervision by the OCC.\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses\ncontinue to be subject to ongoing rule-making and\nimplementation of new regulations and other guidance,\nincluding by the SEC and certain U.S. states with\nrespect to enhanced standards of conduct and conflicts\nof interest. In October 2023, the Department of Labor\n(“DOL”) proposed a new “fiduciary” rule that could\nsignificantly expand the scope for defining who can be\ndeemed investment advice fiduciaries for purposes of\nretirement plans and individual retirement accounts\n(“IRAs”) under the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as amended. Among the most significant\nimpacts of the proposed rule and related amendments to\nprohibited transaction exemptions would be the impact\non the fee and compensation practices at financial\ninstitutions that offer investment recommendations to\nretirement clients, including in the context of\nrollovers from an employer plan to an IRA.\nDerivatives regulation:\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its\nderivatives businesses. In the U.S., JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap\ndealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC\nas “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these\nentities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory\nframework applicable to their swap or security-based\nswap activities, including capital requirements, rules\nrequiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and\nsecurity-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of\ncounterparty collateral, business conduct and\ndocumentation standards, rules requiring the central\nclearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives, requirements that certain standardized\nOTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues,\nrecord-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-\nfraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar\nrequirements have also been established in the\nEuropean Union (“EU”) under the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as well\nas in the U.K. and other jurisdictions around the\nworld.\n7",

These\nlaws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving,\nsubject to interpretation, remain a focus of\nregulators globally, may be enforced by private\nparties or government bodies, and continue to have a\nsignificant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and\noperations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal\ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA\nincludes a variety of record-keeping and reporting\nrequirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-\ncustomer documentation requirements. The Firm is also\nsubject to the regulations and economic sanctions\nprograms administered and enforced by the U.S.\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)\nand EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in countries that\nare, involved in activities including terrorism,\nhostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.\nThe Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws,\nrules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which\nit operates, including those that conflict with or\nprohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying\nwith certain laws, rules and regulations to which it\nis otherwise subject.\nAnti-Corruption:\nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices:\nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to\noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other\nagencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued\nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to\nensure that incentive compensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking\nthat threatens the organizations’ safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has\nalso established standards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm’s compensation\npractices are also subject to regulation and oversight\nby regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the\nFifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as\nimplemented in the EU and as largely adopted in the\nU.K, which includes compensation-related provisions.\nThe European Banking Authority has instituted\nguidelines on compensation policies including under\nCRD V which in certain countries (such as Germany) are\nimplemented or\nsupplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The\nU.K. regulators have also instituted regulations and\nguidelines on compensation policies, which diverge in\ncertain areas from EU rules. The Firm expects that the\nimplementation of regulatory guidelines regarding\ncompensation in the U.S. and other countries will\ncontinue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which\nthe Firm structures its compensation programs and\npractices.\nSustainability:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and the EU have continued to\nimplement and enhance sustainability-related\ninitiatives and disclosure requirements. The Corporate\nSustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will\nreplace and significantly expand the scope and content\nof certain EU ESG reporting requirements, with phased-\nin requirements starting with fiscal years in 2024. In\naddition, in December 2023, the EU reached agreement\non the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence\nDirective (“CSDDD”). The CSDDD sets mandatory due\ndiligence obligations for companies to address actual\nand potential human rights violations and\nenvironmental adverse impacts stemming from their own\noperations and business relationships, including the\nactivities of certain companies with which they have\nestablished business relationships and also requires\nthe adoption of company-specific climate-related\ntransition plans.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with\nthe laws, rules and regulations that apply to its\noperations in all of the jurisdictions around the\nworld in which it does business, and financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to\nextensive and constantly-evolving regulation and\nsupervision.\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase\nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations, and JPMorgan\nChase could be required to make changes to its\nbusiness and operations in response to supervisory\nexpectations or decisions or to new or changed laws,\nrules and regulations. These types of developments\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional\ncosts or experiencing a reduction in revenues to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations,\nwhich could reduce its profitability. Furthermore,\nJPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new\nbusiness or an increase in its principal investments\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional\nlaws, rules, and regulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase\nhas in the past been and could in the future be,\nrequired to:\nlimit the products and services that it offers\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its\nmarket-making activities\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that\nit might otherwise pursue\npay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum\nglobal tax regime), assessments, levies or other\ngovernmental charges, including in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\nincur losses, including with respect to fraudulent\ntransactions perpetrated against its customers\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities,\nor\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and\nservices, which could reduce the demand for them.\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws,\nrules and regulations to which it is subject could\nresult in:\nincreased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\nregulatory and governmental enforcement actions\nthe imposition of fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nincreased exposure to litigation, or\nharm to its reputation.\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services\nregulation and supervision can negatively impact\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses, operations and financial\nresults.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms can\nvary according to factors such as the size of the\nfirm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation and\nregulatory scrutiny\nfinancial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation, or may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not have the same\nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies which supervise more diversified financial\nservices firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory and supervisory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction may favor\nfinancial institutions that are based in that\njurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase\nlosing market share to competitors that are less\nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial products.\n10\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways\nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are implemented in the\nU.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to implement a global\nregulatory or supervisory standard, a national\nregulator may introduce additional or more restrictive\nrequirements, which can create competitive\ndisadvantages for financial services firms, such as\nJPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced\nregulations.\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have\nadopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict\nwith or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise\nsubject, creating conflict of law issues that also\nincrease its risk of non-compliance in those\njurisdictions.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant\nmodifications to its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant countries or regions in\norder to comply with those requirements. These include\nlaws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or\nproposed, as well as regulatory expectations, relating\nto:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital\nor liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nthe implementation of processes within locally-based\nsubsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements or expectations\nthe separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking\nproducts and services from markets activities\nrequirements for the orderly resolution of financial\ninstitutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions\non exchanges or through central counterparties\n(“CCPs”), or for depositing funds with other financial\ninstitutions or clearing and settlement systems\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorgan\nChase to:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nmaintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, or\nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs\nincur higher operational and compliance costs\nchange the prices that it charges for its products\nand services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to\nits customers and clients\ncurtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\nbecome subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses, results of operations and\nprofitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral\nconsequences, and could result in higher compliance\ncosts or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and\nscrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other\npenalties and experienced other repercussions in\nconnection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan\nChase could become subject to similar regulatory or\ngovernmental resolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements of any such\nresolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and compliance costs,\nincluding devoting substantial resources to the\nrequired remediation or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, government officials in the U.S. and\nother countries have demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against financial institutions\nand have required that institutions plead guilty to\ncriminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in\nconnection with resolving regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have\nsignificant collateral consequences for the subject\nfinancial institution, including:\n11",

For example,\nconducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to\ndevote significant additional resources to\nunderstanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws,\nrules and regulations, as well as structuring its\noperations to comply with local laws, rules and\nregulations and implementing and administering related\ninternal policies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in compliance\nwith the laws, rules and regulations of all of the\njurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of\nnon-compliance can be greater in jurisdictions that\nhave less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or curtail\nits businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those\nagencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly\nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorgan\nChase’s resolution plan by these agencies may change,\nand the requirements for resolution plans may be\nmodified from time to time. Any such determinations or\nmodifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing\nto make changes to its legal entity structure or to\ncertain internal or external activities, which could\nincrease its funding or operational costs, or hamper\nits ability to serve clients and customers.\n12\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements\nor restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities\nor operations. The agencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest\nassets or businesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and\nstrategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter into\na resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible\nLTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s\noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to\nenter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will absorb the\nlosses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that\nonly the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue\nnormal operations or subsequently be divested or wound\ndown in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent\nCompany’s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on\nits unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of\nthose securities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries\nand to the claims of priority (as determined by\nstatute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in\nbankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would realize value\nonly to the extent available to the Parent Company as\na shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nother subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point\nof entry recapitalization model could be a desirable\nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title\nII. However, the FDIC\nhas not formally adopted a single point of entry\nresolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into,\na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan\nChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under whatever\nstrategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than\nthey might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred\nstrategy.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical or geopolitical developments can negatively\nimpact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries\ncan cause uncertainty in the economic environment and\nmarket conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its\nbusinesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives,\nas well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could\nsignificantly affect U.S. and global economic growth\nand cause higher volatility in the financial markets,\nincluding:\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other\ngeopolitical instabilities\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal\nReserve and other central banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained large-scale asset\npurchases or any suspension or reversal of those\nactions\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation\nand spending\nactions that governments take or fail to take in\nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the\nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics,\nas well as the effectiveness of any actions taken\ngovernmental actions or initiatives relating to\nclimate risk, or more generally, the impact of\nbusiness activities on environmental, social and\ngovernance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of\nclimate and other ESG-related risks\nisolationist foreign policies\neconomic or financial sanctions\nthe implementation of tariffs and other\nprotectionist trade policies, or\nother governmental policies or actions adopted or\ntaken in response to political or social pressures.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty\nabout the possible outcomes of these developments,\ncould:\nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and\nfinancial markets, which could potentially undermine\nthe status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency\n13",

expropriation or nationalization of\nassets, including client assets, or\nother market dislocations, including unfavorable\neconomic conditions that could spread from a\nparticular country or region to other countries or\nregions.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan\nChase to suffer losses on its market-making positions\nor in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity\nand capital levels, increase the allowance for credit\nlosses or lead to higher net charge-offs, hamper its\nability to deliver\nproducts and services to its clients and customers,\nand weaken its results of operations and financial\ncondition or credit rating.\nJPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations\nmay also be adversely affected by actions or\ninitiatives by national, state or local governmental\nauthorities that:\nseek to discourage financial institutions from doing\nbusiness with companies engaged in certain industries,\nor conversely, to penalize financial institutions that\nelect not to do business with such companies, or\nmandate specific business practices that companies\noperating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction may\ndiffer or conflict with those in other jurisdictions,\nJPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences\nregardless of the course of action it takes or elects\nnot to take, including:\nrestrictions or prohibitions on doing business\nwithin a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental\nentities in a jurisdiction\nthe threat of enforcement actions, including under\nantitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and\nregulations, and\nharm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists and\nother stakeholders.\nJPMorgan Chase has been prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business activities in specific jurisdictions\nas a result of these types of governmental actions,\nand there is no assurance that it will not face\nsimilar restrictions on its business and operations in\nthe future.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability\nto transact with clients and customers, and with\ngovernmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely\naffected if its decisions with respect to doing\nbusiness with companies in certain sensitive\nindustries are perceived to harm those companies or to\nalign with particular political viewpoints.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or\nassociation with certain environmental and social\nindustry groups or initiatives could be viewed by\nactivists or governmental authorities as boycotting or\nother discriminatory business behavior.\nMarket\nEconomic and market events and conditions can\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be\nnegatively affected by adverse changes in any of the\nfollowing:\ninvestor, consumer and business sentiment\nevents that reduce confidence in the financial\nmarkets\ninflation, deflation or recession\n14\nhigh unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor\nmarket\nthe availability and cost of capital, liquidity and\ncredit\nlevels and volatility of interest rates, credit\nspreads and market prices for currencies,

attacks, climate change, natural\ndisasters, severe weather conditions, health\nemergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,\nepidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events\nbeyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, and\nthe strength of the U.S. and global economies.\nAll of these are affected by global economic, market\nand political events and conditions, as well as\nregulatory restrictions.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and\nmarket-making businesses can suffer losses due to\nunanticipated market events, including:\nsevere declines in asset values\nunexpected credit events\nunforeseen events or conditions that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to become correlated\n(and vice versa)\nthe inability to effectively hedge risks related to\nmarket-making and investment portfolio positions, or\nother market risks that may not have been\nappropriately taken into account in the development,\nstructuring or pricing of a financial instrument.\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in\nits investment portfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively\naffected by adverse economic conditions and\ngovernmental policies.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly\naffected by U.S. and global economic conditions,\nincluding:\npersonal and household income distribution\nunemployment or underemployment\nprolonged periods of exceptionally high or low\ninterest rates\nchanges in the value of collateral such as\nresidential real estate and vehicles\nchanges in housing prices\nthe level of inflation and its effect on prices for\ngoods and services\nconsumer and small business confidence levels, and\nchanges in consumer spending or in the level of\nconsumer debt.\nHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment\nthat result in reduced personal and household income\ncould negatively affect consumer credit performance to\nthe extent that consumers are less able to service\ntheir debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or\nnegative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand\nfor the products and services offered by JPMorgan\nChase’s consumer businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which\ncan reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These\nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain\ngeographies, including where declining industrial or\nmanufacturing activity has resulted in or could result\nin higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels\nof consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans,\ncould impair the ability of customers to pay their\nother consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses\ncould also be adversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment status\nand housing\nlaws, rules and regulations relating specifically to\nthe financial services industry, such as limitations\non late payment, overdraft and interchange fees, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as\nhigher taxes and increased regulation which could\nresult in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale\nbusinesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for\nwhich it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions.\nThese factors can also influence the willingness of\nother financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that\nJPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant\nand sustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses engaged in capital markets activities,\nincluding loan syndication, securities underwriting\nand leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to\nthe extent that those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to\n15",

For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuation of client\nassets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under\ncustody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nrevenue from fees that are based on the amount of\nassets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse\nmacroeconomic or market conditions could prompt\noutflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or\ncause clients to invest in products that generate\nlower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the\ninvestment performance of the fund, particularly if\nthe outflows create the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular\nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe\ndownturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, severe declines in commercial real\nestate values, or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that affect specific economic sectors, could\nhave a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan\nChase whose operations or financial condition are\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on the health or\nstability of those market segments or economic\nsectors, as well as clients that are engaged in\nrelated businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit\nlosses on its loans and other commitments to clients\nthat operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of\nthe economy that is or comes under stress.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that results in shifts in consumer and\nbusiness spending could also have a negative impact on\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and\nthereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its\nwholesale operations. For example, the businesses of\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are\ndependent on consistent streams of rental income from\ncommercial real estate properties, including offices,\nwhich are owned or being built by those clients.\nSustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid work\nmodels could result in reductions in the rental cash\nflows that owners or developers receive from their\ntenants which, in turn, could depress the values of\nthe properties, impair the ability of borrowers to\nservice or refinance their commercial real estate\nloans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These\nconsequences could result in JPMorgan Chase\nexperiencing increases in the allowance for credit\nlosses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs\nwithin its commercial real estate loan portfolio and\nincurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume\nof delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in\nforeclosures could result in higher operational risk\nassociated with JPMorgan Chase owning and managing\nreal property, and any inadequacy in governance or\ncontrol over the foreclosed properties could result in\nregulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its\nliquidity or its capital levels.\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan\nChase can generally be expected to earn higher net\ninterest income. However, higher interest rates can\nalso lead to:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to\nhigher financing costs for clients\nthe loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that interest\nrates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those\nof competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect\nassumptions about depositor behavior\nlosses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held\nin the investment securities portfolio\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce\ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of\nshort-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels,\nand any negative outcomes could be more severe in a\nprolonged period of high interest rates. Higher\ninterest rates can also negatively affect the payment\nperformance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer\nand wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to\nvariable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate\nloans are unable to afford higher interest payments,\nthose borrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could\nreduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its\ninvestment securities portfolio to the extent that it\nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\n16\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s\nmortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, decreasing\nrevenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive\nfor JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit\nspreads may widen or narrow not only in response to\nevents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan\nChase but also as a result of general economic and\ngeopolitical events and conditions. Changes in\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect,\npositively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on\ncertain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are\nrecorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the\nvalue of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets can be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and other disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may make it extremely difficult to\nvalue certain financial instruments. Subsequent\nvaluations of financial instruments in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, at the time of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of\nthese factors could cause a decline in the value of\nfinancial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets, which may have an adverse\neffect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure\nto more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan\nChase’s hedging and other risk management strategies\nmay not be effective, and it could incur significant\nlosses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,\nsecurities exchanges and government entities within\nand outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose\nJPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and\ncounterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses\nor liability where a financial institution that\nit has appointed to provide custodial services for\nclient assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result\nof fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations, or where clients are unable to access\nassets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to\ngovernmental actions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure\nof, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes\ncontracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby increasing its operational\ncosts and potentially resulting in losses. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a\nmember of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a\nmember defaults on its obligations to the CCP because\nof requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a\nportion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase\ncan be subject to bearing its share of non-default\nlosses incurred by a CCP, including losses from\ncustodial, settlement or investment activities or due\nto cyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan\nChase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its\nclients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring\nclients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase\nis also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its\nclients in connection with providing cash management,\nclearing, custodial and other transaction services to\nthose clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase\nprovides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent,\nJPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the\nclient’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase\nmay suffer losses to the extent that any collateral\nthat it has received is insufficient to cover those\nlosses.\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks.\nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim\nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond\nthe legal authority of those officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous incumbent\ngovernment. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct\nbusiness in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could\nlimit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or\nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments,\nwhich could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives\ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement\nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan\nChase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit losses. These\nconsequences can\n17",
