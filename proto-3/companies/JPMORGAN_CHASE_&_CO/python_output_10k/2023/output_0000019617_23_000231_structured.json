          "content": "Part I\nmarket stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan\nChase could suffer losses during these periods if it\nis unable to realize the fair value of collateral or\nto manage declines in the value of collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising\nfrom concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market\nrisk to the extent that groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations to\nbe similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit\nquality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or\ncounterparties could lead to concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties\nin similar, related or dependent industries. This type\nof interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s\ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses, including fair\nvalue losses in its market-making businesses and\ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may\nbe required to increase the allowance for credit\nlosses with respect to certain clients or industries\nin order to align with directives or expectations of\nits banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect\na particular industry or geographic area could lead to\nconcerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s\nborrowers or counterparties not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These\nconditions could also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer\nbusinesses who live in those areas or work in those\naffected industries or related or dependent industries\nto meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan\nChase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit and market risk exposures to assess the\npotential risks of concentration or contagion, but its\nability to diversify or hedge its exposure against\nthose risks may be limited.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by\nbank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition\nfor certain types of consumer loans could prompt\nindustry-wide reactions such as significant reductions\nin the pricing or margins of those loans or the making\nof loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently default on their\nloans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an\neconomic downturn or other factors, this could impair\ntheir ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan\nChase and result in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly, widespread\ndefaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the\nU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses\nmay earn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks associated\nwith those positions and the level of risk-weighted-\nassets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its\nbalance sheet. These factors could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and\nthe profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any\ngiven time by factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements,\nincluding as a result of changes in laws, rules and\nregulations\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, periods of market stress, low\ninvestor confidence and significant market illiquidity\ncould result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan\nChase and could limit its access to some of its\ntraditional sources of liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced.\nAlternative sources of funding could be more expensive\nor limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding\ncosts could also be negatively affected by actions\nthat JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net\nstable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively\nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability\nto fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries,\nand thereby adversely affect its results of\noperations.\n18\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends\non the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments\non its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds\nthe stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings\nLLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The\nIHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany\nlending to the holding company.\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the\nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior\nand subordinated debt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC\nto make payments to the holding company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions,\nas well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity\nrequirements and other regulatory restrictions on its\nability to make payments to the holding company. The\nIHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the holding company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are\notherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or\nBoard of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the\nholding company to make various payments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect the holding company’s ability\nto:\npay interest on its debt securities\npay dividends on its equity securities\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the holding\ncompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or\notherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a\ntime earlier than would have been the case absent the\nexistence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to\nwhich the IHC is subject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and\nindustry-specific factors when determining credit\nratings for a particular financial institution,\nincluding:\nexpected future profitability\nrisk management practices\nlegal expenses\nratings differentials between bank holding companies\nand their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\nregulatory developments\nassumptions about government support, and\neconomic and geopolitical developments.\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could influence\nits credit ratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be\nlowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade\ncould occur at times of broader market instability\nwhen JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events\nmay be more limited and general investor confidence is\nlow.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and\nreduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk\non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This\ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe transition to alternative reference rates could\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or\nlitigation and other disputes.\nRegulators, industry bodies and other market\nparticipants in the U.S. and other countries continue\nto engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage\nthe use of alternative reference rates to replace\ncertain interest rate indices that are deemed to be\n“benchmarks”, and certain of these alternative rates\nhave gained or are gaining acceptance among market\nparticipants. However, there is no assurance that:\nany of these new rates will be similar to, or\nproduce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks\nthat they seek to replace\narrangements by market participants to prepare for\nthe discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates will be\nfully effective, or\na particular alternative reference rate will be\nwidely accepted by market participants, or that market\nacceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the\nintroduction of other reference rates.\n19",

          "content": "Part I\nFor example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives and other financial\ninstruments are still linked to the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark, and significant\nprogress has been made by regulators, industry bodies\nand market participants to introduce and implement the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a\nreplacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if\nmarket participants have not implemented effective\noperational and other arrangements to address the\ntransition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could\nresult in dislocation in the financial markets,\nvolatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives\nand other instruments, and the suppression of capital\nmarkets activities, all of which could have a negative\nimpact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and\non U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or\nother instruments which are issued, funded, serviced\nor held by JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in\nlitigation and other types of disputes with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and investors as a\nconsequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand other benchmark rates to replacement rates,\nincluding claims that JPMorgan Chase has:\ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors unfairly, or caused them to experience\nlosses, higher financing costs or lower returns on\ninvestments\nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of\nthe transition from benchmark rates on the products\nthat JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and\ncustomers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts\nof interest\nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or\ninvestments on behalf of its clients, or sold products\nthat did not serve their intended purpose, in\nconnection with the transition from benchmark rates\nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the\nmanipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in\nconnection with the discontinuation of or transition\nfrom benchmark rates, or\ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors when interpreting or making determinations\nunder the terms of agreements or financial\ninstruments.\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to\nhigher legal expenses and operational costs, require\nit to pay significant amounts in connection with\nresolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its\nreputation.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving regulatory\nrequirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally\nSystemically\nImportant Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to\nhold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB\nsurcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a\ncountercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at\nleast annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan\nChase is required to hold in order to satisfy these\nleverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at\nany given time due to factors such as:\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in\nlaws, rules, and regulations\nactions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.\ngovernment in response to the economic effects of\nsystemic events, such as the actions taken in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of\nthe Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits\nheld by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial\ninstitutions and, consequently, an increase in\nleverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge\nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase RWA,\nsuch as increased market risk, customer delinquencies,\nclient credit rating downgrades or other factors, and\nincreases in estimated stress losses as determined\nby the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan\nChase’s SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital\nrequirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan\nChase’s shareholders, such as:\nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan\nChase is permitted to repurchase\nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management\nstrategy\nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\ncurtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or\noperations.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of its operational systems and those of\nother market participants.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and report a large\nnumber of transactions on a continuous basis, and to\ndo so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to\nproper design, installation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective\n20\nfunctioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems\ndepends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can\nsignificantly compromise the functionality or\nreliability of a particular system and other systems\nto which it transmits or from which it receives\ninformation, and\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately\nmaintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis,\nand to ensure that any changes introduced to its\nsystems are managed carefully to ensure security and\noperational continuity and adherence to all applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of third parties,\nincluding its custodians, vendors (such as those that\nprovide data and cloud computing services, and\nsecurity and technology services) and other market\nparticipants (such as clearing and payment systems,\nCCPs and securities exchanges).\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,\nincluding due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or\nother systems failure, could result in unfavorable\nripple effects in the financial markets and for\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers,\nincluding:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services,\nliquidity or information to clients and customers\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain\naccess to funds and other assets, including those for\nwhich physical settlement and delivery is required\nfailure to timely settle or confirm transactions\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients\nand customers\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing\nservices provided by a system that is unavailable\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan\nChase’s products and services\nlimitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect\ndata as required in connection with regulatory or\nother investigations\nregulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase,\nor financial institutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational disruptions, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and\ncomplexity of transactions continue to increase, it\ncan become more challenging to effectively maintain\nand upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and\ninfrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks\nthat:\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase\nor its clients and customers may increase, evolve or\nbecome more complex, particularly during periods of\nmarket disruption or economic uncertainty\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause\nwidespread system disruption\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems compound, or migrate to other\nsystems over time, to become larger issues\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software,\nor degraded performance of microprocessors, could\ncause disruptions in operational systems, or the\ninability of systems to communicate with each other,\nand\nthird parties may attempt to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of\nnewly-acquired businesses or of external parties on\nwhich JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable\nto meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses and operations or bank regulatory\nstandards, or if they fail or have other significant\nshortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase\ncould cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on\nits computer systems, software, networks and other\ntechnology assets on a daily basis from various\nactors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile\ncountries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e.,\nindividuals or groups that use technology to promote a\npolitical agenda or social change) and others. These\ncyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts\nto introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which\nare commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan\nChase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\n21",

Any\nsuch breach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide\nabsolute security against cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate, detect or\nrecognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches because:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of\nsources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,\ncyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to\nterrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third\nparties whose objective is to disrupt the operations\nof financial institutions more generally\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network without\nbeing detected, might obtain access to other networks\nand systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such as:\nJPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings and\nits internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud computing\nservices\nthe acquisition and integration of new businesses,\nand\nthe increased use of remote access and third party\nvideo conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-\nhome arrangements for employees.\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or\ncommunications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan\nChase’s employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of\na vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative consequences,\nincluding:\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to operational\nsystems\nmisappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems\nand those of its clients, customers and counterparties\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to\nfully recover and restore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent\nsystems from processing fraudulent transactions\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy\nand other laws\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity\nand business resiliency measures\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps\nthat JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate\nthe attack may not be immediately clear, and it may\ntake a significant amount of time before such an\ninvestigation can be completed. While such an\ninvestigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by\nthe cyber attack, and that damage may continue to\nspread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s\nability to provide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and regulators, as well as\nthe public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best\nto contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber\nattack, and certain errors or actions could be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could further\nincrease the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\n22\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to products,\nservices and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services (including mobile\nconnectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing),\nacquires or invests in a business or makes changes to\nan existing product, service or delivery platform, it\nmay not fully appreciate or identify new operational\nrisks that may arise from those changes, or may fail\nto implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant failure\nin this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto operate one or more of its businesses or result in:\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and\ncustomers\nincreased operating expenses\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines,\npenalties and other sanctions\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity\nregulatory intervention, or\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\nresults of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer\nsatisfaction could be adversely affected by the\nfailure of an external operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is\nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be\nsources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems\nfailure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a\nvendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan\nChase is directly connected, but also to a systems\nbreakdown or cyber attack involving another party to\nwhich such a vendor or infrastructure is connected.\nSimilarly, retailers, payment systems and processors,\ndata aggregators and other external parties with which\nJPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase\nJPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is\nparticularly the case where activities of customers or\nother parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and\ncontrol systems, including through the use of the\ninternet, cloud computing services, and personal smart\nphones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party experiences\na cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates\nthat data, this could\nresult in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan\nChase and its clients and customers, including:\nheightened risk that external parties will be able\nto execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as\npotential liability for losses that exceed thresholds\nestablished in consumer protection laws, rules and\nregulations\nincreased operational costs to remediate the\nconsequences of the external party’s security breach,\nand\nreputational harm arising from the perception that\nJPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of\noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to\nthe systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or\nsystems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or\nhuman error or misconduct affecting other external\nparties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems\nor to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial\ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing\nhouses and other financial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that the disruption of an\noperational system involving one institution or\nentity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause\nindustry-wide operational disruptions that could\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct\nbusiness.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations rely on its\nability, and the ability of key external parties, to\nmaintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the\ncompetence, trustworthiness, health and safety of\nemployees.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients and\ncustomers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its\nability to staff its operations appropriately and on\nthe competence, integrity, health and safety of its\nemployees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations\nsimilarly rely on the workforces of third parties,\nincluding employees of vendors, custodians and\nfinancial markets infrastructures, and of businesses\nthat it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses could be materially and adversely affected\nby:\nthe ineffective implementation of business decisions\n23",

Governmental authorities around the world\nhave adopted and are considering the adoption of\nnumerous legislative and regulatory initiatives\nconcerning privacy, data protection and security.\nLitigation or enforcement actions relating to these\nlaws, rules and regulations could result in\nfines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change\nits data-related practices, which could have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide\nproducts and otherwise harm its business operations.\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws, rules\nand regulations in all relevant jurisdictions,\nincluding where the laws of different jurisdictions\nare in conflict, can:\nincrease JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating\ncosts\nhinder the development of new products or services,\ncurtail the offering of existing products or services,\nor affect how products and services are offered to\nclients and customers\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s\nmanagement, and\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses,\noperations and systems in less efficient ways.\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties may\nhave appropriate controls in place to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of the\ninformation exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase,\nparticularly where information is transmitted by\nelectronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions if personal information of clients,\ncustomers, employees or others were to be mishandled\nor misused, such as situations where such information\nis:\nerroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized\nthird parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or\neven the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers or\nemployees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s\nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived\nfailure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations\nmay subject it to inquiries, examinations and\ninvestigations that could result in requirements to\nmodify or cease certain operations or practices,\nsignificant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties\nor other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan\nChase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its\nbusinesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving\nthe inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage\nof personal information have led to expanded\ngovernmental scrutiny of practices relating to the\nprocessing or safeguarding of personal information by\ncompanies in the U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in\nthe future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules and regulations relating to the collection, use,\nsharing and storage of personal information. These\ntypes of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms such\nas JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across\nnational borders or sharing information among\naffiliates or with third parties such as vendors,\nthereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict\nJPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when\ndeveloping or offering products or services to\ncustomers. Some countries are considering or have\nadopted legislation implementing data protection\nrequirements or requiring local storage and processing\nof data which could increase the cost and complexity\nof JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products and services.\nThese restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s\ndevelopment or marketing of certain products or\nservices, or increase the costs of offering them to\ncustomers.\n24\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation\ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events\nbeyond its control.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems\ncould be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could\nbe harmed, by events or contributing factors that are\nwholly or partially beyond its control, including\nmaterial instances of:\ncyber attacks\nsecurity breaches of its physical premises,\nincluding threats to health and safety\npower, telecommunications or internet outages, or\nshutdowns of mass transit\nfailure of, or loss of access to, technology or\noperational systems, including any resulting loss of\ncritical data\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan\nChase or third parties, and any consequent injuries,\nincluding in connection with any construction projects\nundertaken by JPMorgan Chase\neffects of climate change\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\naccidents such as explosions or structural failures\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\nevents arising from local or larger-scale civil or\npolitical unrest, any outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program\nthat is intended to enable it to recover critical\nbusiness functions and supporting assets, including\nstaff, technology and facilities, in the event of a\nbusiness disruption, including due to the occurrence\nof an extraordinary event beyond its control. There\ncan be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency\nplans will fully mitigate all potential business\ncontinuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and\ncustomers and third parties with which it does\nbusiness, or that its resiliency plans will be\nadequate to address the effects of simultaneous\noccurrences of multiple business disruption events. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond\neffectively to a business disruption event could be\nhampered to the extent that the members of its\nworkforce, physical assets or systems and other\nsupport infrastructure needed to address the event are\ngeographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an\nevent were to occur in an area in which they are\nconcentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or\nthe factors that cause or contribute to those events\nbecome more chronic, the disruptive effects of those\nevents on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations,\nand on its clients, customers, counterparties and\nemployees, could become more significant and long-\nlasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan\nChase’s operations or operational systems, or the\noccurrence of one or more extraordinary events that\nare beyond its control, could:\nhinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services\nto its clients and customers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including\nfrom loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\ndisrupt market infrastructure systems on which\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\nharm its reputation.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers can\nresult in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing business\nwith vendors and other service providers, including\nstandards relating to the outsourcing of functions as\nwell as the performance of significant banking and\nother functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection with its\ninitiatives to address the risks associated with\noversight of its internal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately\nassess and manage these relationships, especially\nthose involving significant banking functions, shared\nservices or other critical activities, could\nmaterially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase.\nSpecifically, any such failure could result in:\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost\nrevenues\nincreased operational costs, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be\neffective in identifying and mitigating every risk to\nJPMorgan Chase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure, practices,\nmodels or reporting systems could expose it to\nunexpected losses, and its financial condition or\nresults of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse\ncould:\n25",

Any deficiencies in the quality or\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering,\nanalysis and validation processes could result in\nineffective risk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in inaccurate or\nuntimely risk reporting.\nMany of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior and\nto some degree are based on management’s subjective\njudgment or assumptions. For example, many models used\nby JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding\nhistorical correlations among prices of various asset\nclasses or other market indicators. In times of market\nstress, including difficult or less liquid market\nenvironments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic movements could, in some circumstances, limit\nthe effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management\nstrategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations\nor judgments, including those used in its financial\nstatements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital, liquidity,\noperational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses\ninternal models and estimations as a basis for its\nstress testing and in connection with the preparation\nof its financial statements under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of\nassumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically\nreviewed and modified as necessary. The models and\nestimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be\neffective in all cases to identify, observe and\nmitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist\nin the future, including assumptions underlying the\nmodels and estimations such as correlations among\ncertain market indicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or\nmay not be indicative of severely negative market\nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or\nlack of liquidity\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices\nof certain loans and securities may make it more\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be\nwell understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, and\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models\nand estimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or the\npreparation of its financial statements prove to have\nbeen inadequate or incorrect. For example, where\nquoted market prices are not available for certain\nfinancial instruments that require a determination of\ntheir fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value\ndeterminations based on internally developed models or\nother means which ultimately rely to some degree on\nmanagement estimates and judgment.\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for\nexpected credit losses related to its credit exposures\nwhich requires significant judgments, including\nforecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers\nto repay their loans or other obligations. These types\nof estimates and judgments may not prove to be\naccurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above.\nThis is particularly true when the current and\nforecasted environments are significantly different\nfrom the historical environments upon which the models\nwere developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced during\nthe early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nincreased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree\nof judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments\nthat JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than\nwould otherwise be the case.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing\n26\nrisks are subject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These\nreviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations for calculating market\nrisk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA\nunder Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or\nestimations are not approved by its regulators, it may\nbe subject to higher capital charges, which could\nadversely affect its financial results or limit the\nability to expand its businesses.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial\nreporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective\nin every circumstance, or that a material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency in internal control over\nfinancial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or\ndeficiencies could result in inaccurate financial\nreporting which, in turn, could:\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapses or deficiencies\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and\nexecute effective business strategies, and to\nanticipate changes affecting those strategies,\nJPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results\ncould suffer.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly\naffect its competitive standing and operations. These\nstrategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it\noffers products and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and\ngoals that prove to be incorrect, are based on\nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do\nnot accurately assess the competitive landscape and\nindustry trends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or the expectations\nof clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees and other stakeholders, then the\nfranchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could\ndecline.\nJPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective\nbusiness plans to address these strategic priorities,\nboth in the near term and over longer time horizons.\nManagement’s effectiveness in this regard will affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term\nstability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest\nin market-leading businesses, even in a highly\nstressed environment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\nconduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or effectively\nintegrate newly-acquired businesses\nappropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary to\ngrow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations in a given\nperiod.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services\nindustry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to the\nsignificant changes as a result of changes in\nfinancial regulation, technological advances,\nincreased public scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in\nthe U.S. and global financial services industry will\ncontinue to be intense.

For example, aggressive\nor less disciplined lending practices by nonbank\ncompetitors could lead to a loss of market share for\ntraditional banks, and in an economic downturn could\nresult in instability in the financial services\nindustry and adversely impact other market\nparticipants, including JPMorgan Chase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were banking\nproducts. These advances have also allowed financial\ninstitutions and other companies to provide electronic\nand internet-based financial solutions, including\nelectronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,\nlending and other extensions of credit to consumers,\npayments processing and online automated algorithmic-\nbased investment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other products\nand services, including deposits and other traditional\nbanking products, could be significantly disrupted by\nthe use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies\nand other applications using secure distributed\nledgers, that require no intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could require JPMorgan\nChase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to\nattract and retain clients and customers or to match\nproducts and services offered by its competitors,\nincluding technology companies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers, or breached or\ninfiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways,\nwhich can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations that apply\nto the offering of products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase\nearns from providing products and services through\nthose technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on\nthe pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share,\nparticularly with respect to traditional banking\nproducts. This competition may be on the basis of\nquality and variety of products and services offered,\ntransaction execution, innovation, reputation and\nprice. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses to meet the expectations of clients and\ncustomers, whether due to general market conditions,\nunder-performance, a decision not to offer a\nparticular product or service, changes in client and\ncustomer expectations or other factors, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients\nand customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce\nJPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital\ninvestments in its businesses, or to extend more of\nits capital on behalf of its clients in order to\nremain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both\ndirectly and as a result of impacts on its clients and\ncustomers.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its business, and\nthe activities of its clients and customers, could be\nadversely affected by climate change. Climate change\ncould manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase\neither through changes in the physical climate or from\nthe process of transitioning to a lower-carbon\neconomy. Both physical risks and transition risks\nassociated with climate change could have negative\nimpacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness\nof JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its\nexposure to those clients and customers.\nClimate-related physical risks include the increased\nfrequency or severity of acute weather events, such as\nfloods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic\nshifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in\nprecipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases\nin average ambient temperature.Potential adverse\nimpacts of climate-related physical risks include:\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\nreduced availability or increased cost of insurance\nfor clients of JPMorgan Chase\ninterruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\npopulation migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to a\nlower-carbon economy, such as changes in public\npolicy, adoption of new technologies or changes in\nconsumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and\nservices. These risks could also be influenced by\nchanges in the physical climate. Potential adverse\nimpacts of transition risks include:\nsudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by\nchanges in climate policy\nincreased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as higher taxation and\naccelerated decarbonization policies\nnegative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due\nto any perception that its business practices are\n28\ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\nClimate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies\nand conflicts in the manner in which climate policy\nand financial regulation is implemented in the many\nregions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including\ninitiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation\nwith extraterritorial effect.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm\nclients and customers, impact market integrity, damage\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and\nregulatory action.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers and counterparties, and with each other,\nevery day. All employees are expected to demonstrate\nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral\npart of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do\nBusiness Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s\ncommitment to “do first class business in a first\nclass way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct\nrisk management throughout an employee’s life cycle,\nincluding recruiting, onboarding, training and\ndevelopment, and performance management. Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral component of JPMorgan\nChase’s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in improper\nor illegal conduct in the past. These instances of\nmisconduct have resulted in litigation, and\nresolutions of governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred\nprosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and\nother civil or criminal sanctions. There is no\nassurance that further inappropriate or unlawful\nactions by employees have not occurred or will not\noccur, lead to a violation of the terms of these\nresolutions (and associated consequences), or that any\nsuch actions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a failure\nby one or more employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations,\npolicies and practices, including by acting in ways\nthat harm clients, customers, other market\nparticipants, employees or others. Some examples of\nthis include:\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s\nproducts or services\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or\nunauthorized trading\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\nfacilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting\nor financial disclosure treatment that may be subject\nto scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities,\nor where the\nproposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the\neconomic substance of the transaction\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants\nusing electronic communications channels that have\nnot been approved by JPMorgan Chase\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering\na diverse and inclusive workplace\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance\ngoals or employee compensation objectives, and\nmisappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers\nor third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more\nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with\nJPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices\ncould include litigation, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nAny of these proceedings or actions could result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, or lead to:\nfinancial losses\nincreased operational and compliance costs\ngreater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\nregulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its\nactivities\nthe need for significant oversight by JPMorgan\nChase’s management\nloss of clients or customers, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect\nto newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails\nto successfully integrate employees of those\nbusinesses or any of those employees do not conduct\nthemselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's\nexpectations, policies and practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its\nbusinesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its\nability to attract and retain clients, customers,\ninvestors and employees.

This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which\ninformation is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists have been\nincreasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial services firms with public criticism\nconcerning their business practices, including\nbusiness relationships with clients that are engaged\nin certain sensitive industries, such as companies :\nwhose products are or are perceived to be harmful to\nhuman health, or\nwhose activities negatively affect or are perceived\nto negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights\nor communities.\nActivists have also taken actions intended to change\nor influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with\nrespect to ESG matters, including public protests at\nJPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties,\nand submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a\nvote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders.\nThese and other types of activist criticism and\nactions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially\nengender dissatisfaction among clients, customers,\ninvestors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase\naddresses ESG concerns in its business activities. In\nall of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan\nChase’s reputation could:\nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing\nbusiness with JPMorgan Chase\nimpair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new\nclients and customers, or to expand its relationships\nwith existing clients and customers\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain\nemployees\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with\ncertain clients or customers\ncause certain investors to divest from investments\nin securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\notherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's\nbusiness and results of operations.\nActions by the financial services industry generally\nor individuals in the industry can also affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged\nby concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial\ninstitution, or\na financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products to\ncustomers.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of\ninterest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as well\nas damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts\nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which encompass a variety\nof transactions, obligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan\nChase can become subject to litigation, enforcement\nactions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its\nreputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived\nfailure to:\n30\nadequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts\nof interest that may arise in connection with\nproviding multiple products and services in, or having\none or more investments related to, the same\ntransaction\nidentify and address any conflict of interest that a\nthird party with which it is does business may have\nwith respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\ntreat clients and customers fairly and with the\nappropriate standard of care\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance\nwith the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or\nhandle or use confidential information of customers\nor clients appropriately and in compliance with\napplicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and\nregulations.\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations\ncould result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation\nand regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement\nactions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and\nhigher operating costs and cause serious harm to\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the global economy and on\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region\nor globally.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups,\nincluding armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks,\ncould expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other\ncountries or escalating into full-scale war with\npotentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if\none or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons.\nDepending on the scope of the conflict, the\nhostilities could result in:\nworldwide economic disruption\nheightened volatility in financial markets\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\ndisruption of global trade, and\ndiminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant\nnegative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly\naffected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly involved in such a\nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any\noperations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well as in any nation\nthat is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and\naggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such\na conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts\nbusiness have economies or markets that are less\ndeveloped and more volatile or may have political,\nlegal and regulatory regimes that are less established\nor predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan\nChase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local\neconomy and business activities are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or control. Some of\nthese countries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth, and\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive\npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, such as:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of\ngovernment actions can negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations in the relevant country, either\ndirectly or by suppressing the business activities of\nlocal clients or multi-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor\neconomic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general\nstrikes\ncrime and corruption\n31",

In addition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations and investments in another country\nor countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial services\nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented\nand diverse new employees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's\nefforts to retain talented and diverse employees can\nbe particularly challenging when members of its\nworkforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors.\nIf JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract\nor retain qualified and diverse employees, including\nsuccessors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of\nthe Operating Committee and other senior leaders,\nJPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its\ncompetitive position, could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chase’s increased use of hybrid work models\ncould result in deterioration in employee performance\nor degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment\nwhich may have a material and adverse effect on its\nbusiness and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing\nhybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto attract and retain employees.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the world.\nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S.\nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise\nmake it more difficult for employees or their family\nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between,\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations\nor conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees, and thereby dilute the quality of its\nworkforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to\nmake structural changes to its worldwide or regional\noperating models that cause its operations to be less\nefficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise\ninvolved in many legal proceedings, including class\nactions and other litigation or disputes with third\nparties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan\nChase may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan\nChase. Any of these matters could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the financial\nservices industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase\nwill continue to experience a high level of litigation\nand regulatory and government investigations related\nto its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nThere is no assurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other enforcement actions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law or regulation\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and officials in the\nU.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business activity\nor practice, this will often give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other governmental\nagencies of the same or similar activity or practice\nby JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to cease\noffering certain products or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation or lead to higher operational costs,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In addition, the\nextent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of reserves that\nJPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.\n32",

Comparisons noted in the sections below are\nfor the full year of 2022 versus the full year of 2021, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview JPMorgan\nChase reported net income of $37.7 billion for 2022, down 22%, earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 14% and ROTCE\nof 18%. • Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting: – Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%,\ndriven by higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Net interest income\nexcluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%.\n– Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net\ninvestment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower auto\noperating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa\nClass B common shares (“Visa B shares”) in Corporate. • Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by\nhigher structural expense and continued investments in the business, including compensation, technology and\nmarketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense. • The provision for credit losses was\n$6.4 billion, reflecting: – a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of $2.3\nbillion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty\nassociated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and – $2.9 billion of net\ncharge-offs. The prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, reflecting a net reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion. • The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at December\n31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, compared with 1.62%\nin the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of\n$1.1 billion, predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and\nloan sales. • Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting: – growth in CCB from existing and new accounts,\nand net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by the\nimpact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and – reductions in CIB and CB\ndue to attrition driven by the rising interest rate environment. Selected capital and other metrics • CET1 capital\nwas $219 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively. • SLR was 5.6%.\nTBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    47\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had average\neligible High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of\napproximately $733 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $694\nbillion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

There is no assurance that actual\nresults in 2023 will be in line with the outlook\ninformation set forth below, and the Firm does not\nundertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nJPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023\nshould be viewed against the backdrop of the global\nand U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the\ngeopolitical environment, the competitive environment,\nclient and customer activity levels, and regulatory\nand legislative developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries where the Firm does business.

The Firm has taken and\ncontinues to take steps to close positions and reduce\ncertain of its business activities and exposures\nconnected with the war, and to assist clients with\nfulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing\ntheir Russia-related risks.\nThe Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated\nclients and counterparties is not material to its\nfinancial condition or results of operations. However,\nthe Firm continues to monitor potential secondary\nimpacts of the war, including increased market\nvolatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of\nfinancial and economic sanctions imposed by various\ngovernments, that could have adverse effects on the\nFirm’s businesses.\nThe Firm also continues to monitor and manage the\noperational risks associated with the war, including\ncompliance with the financial and economic sanctions\nand the increased risk of cyber attacks.\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126,\nAllowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market\nRisk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk\nManagement on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk\nManagement on pages 142-144 for additional\ninformation.\nFor purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to\nexposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for\nwhich the largest proportion of their assets is\nlocated, or the largest proportion of their revenue is\nderived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal\ncountry risk management framework; and “Russia-\nassociated” refers to exposure to clients and\ncounterparties of the Firm with respect to which\neconomic or financial sanctions relating to the war in\nUkraine have been imposed or which have close\nassociation with Russia.\nInterbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition\nThe Firm and other market participants are preparing\nfor the final stages of the transition from the use of\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other\nIBORs in accordance with the International\nOrganization of Securities Commission’s standards for\ntransaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of\nthe publication of the remaining principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-\nmonth, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (“LIBOR\nCessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly\nreduced the notional amount of its exposure to\ncontracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including\nin derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans,\nsecurities, and debt and preferred stock issuances,\nand is on-track to meet both its internal milestones\nfor contract remediation as well as the industry\nmilestones and recommendations published by National\nWorking Groups, including the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to\nengage with clients to assist them with transitioning\ntheir U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to\nreplacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation.\nThe majority of the Firm’s remaining LIBOR exposure is\nto derivative contracts. The Firm will be\nparticipating in initiatives by the principal central\ncounterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives\ncontracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second\nquarter of 2023 which will remediate approximately 40%\nof the Firm’s remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives\nexposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the\nremaining derivatives exposure will be remediated\npredominantly through contractual fallback provisions.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”) was signed into law in the\nU.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing\nU.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy\nfinancial contracts that may not otherwise transition\nto a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In\naddition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is\nproposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required\nto continue to publish the one-month, three-month and\nsix-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic”\nbasis which would allow market participants to use\nsuch rates through September 30, 2024. This proposal\nwould apply to contracts that are outside the scope of\nthe LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked\ncontracts that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the\nLIBOR Act and the proposed publication of “synthetic”\nLIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks\nassociated with, the transition from LIBOR, including\nthe potential for disputes or litigation.\nThe Firm continues to make necessary changes to its\nrisk management systems in connection with the\ntransition from LIBOR, including modifications to its\noperational systems and models. In addition, the Firm\ncontinues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,\nmarket, regulatory and legislative developments\nrelating to the transition from LIBOR.

Refer to Note 6 for additional\ninformation. 2022 compared with 2021 Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as volatile market conditions\nresulted in: • lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower issuance activity, and • lower advisory fees\ndriven by a lower level of announced deals. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting: • higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets,\ndriven by a strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly Currencies &\nEmerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products and Credit, and • higher\nrevenue associated with Equity Derivatives and Prime Finance in Equity Markets,\nlargely offset by • a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a gain of $250\nmillion in the prior year. The loss in the current year reflected funding spread widening and, to a lesser extent,\nlosses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, • net markdowns\nrecorded in the second quarter of 2022 on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge\nfinancing portfolio in CIB and CB, • higher net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate,\nand • net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the\nrelated net interest income earned on those transactions. Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain\ncases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 67-72,\npages 73-75 and pages 79-80, resp ectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related\nfees increased due to higher service fee volume in CCB, predominantly offset by lower cash management fees in CB\nand CIB due to a higher level of credits earned by clients and applied against such fees. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB\nsegment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.\nAsset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased driven by: • lower asset management fees in AWM\nresulting from lower average market levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee\nwaivers, and net long-term inflows, • lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily associated with lower\naverage market values of assets under custody, and • lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting\nreduced volumes, partially offset by • higher commissions on travel-related services and annuity sales in CCB.\nRefer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and Note 6 for\nadditional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    51\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nInvestment securities gains/(losses) reflected higher\nnet losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency\nMBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning\nthe investment securities portfolio in Treasury and\nCIO.

The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses consisted of: • $2.3 billion in wholesale , driven by deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic\noutlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and • $1.2 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by Card\nServices, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially\noffset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as\nthe effects of the pandemic gradually recede. The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses. Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central\nscenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with\nhigher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.\nNet charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, and included: • a $309 million decrease in Card\nServices, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in\nthe second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending, offset by • a $190 million increase in net\ncharge-offs in Auto and Banking & Wealth Management (“ BWM”) as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from\ngovernment stimulus and payment assistance programs, and an increase of $76 million in CIB.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business\ndue to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and\nmarket conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources,\nand its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating\nliquidity needs. • In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower\nsecurities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially\noffset by higher trading assets. • In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts\npayable and other liabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities.\nInvesting activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans,\ninvesting in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. • In 2022, cash used resulted\nfrom net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net\nproceeds from investment securities. • In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and\nhigher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements. Financing\nactivities The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and\npreferred stock. • In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and\nshort-term borrowings. • In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-\nterm borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. • For\nboth periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * *\nRefer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 97-104, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 163 for a further discussion\nof the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    57\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE\nOF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 159-163. That\npresentation, which is referred to as “reported”\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results,\nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results\nof the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition\nof managed basis starts, in each case, with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments\nthat receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable\nto taxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense.

The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital required for\neach LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies\nand reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may be implemented\nin future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products\nand services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the\nparticipating business segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to the other\nsegment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment\nresults reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments\nrelated to corporate support units, technology and\noperations that are not currently utilized by any LOB,\nare not allocated to the business segments and are\nretained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate\ngenerally includes costs that would not be incurred if\nthe segments were stand-alone businesses, and other\nitems not aligned with a particular business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the\nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and\nCIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the segments.\nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment,\nthe cost of funds for assets and the credits earned\nfor liabilities have generally increased, impacting\nthe business segments’ net interest income. During the\nperiod ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in\nhigher cost of funds for loans and contributed to\nmargin expansion on deposits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    61\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these\nrisks centrally and reports the impact of foreign\nexchange rate movements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management\non page 137 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost\nall of the cost of the credit spread component of\noutstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the reportable\nbusiness segments, while the balance of the cost is\nretained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the\ncost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with the\nrelevant regulatory capital requirements and funding\nneeds of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost\nof unsecured long-term debt is included in a business\nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is\nreduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a\nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common\nequity.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nadditional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. The Firm’s\nallocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), Basel III\nAdvanced RWA, the global systemically important banks\n(“GSIB”) surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a\nsevere stress environment. At least annually, the\nassumptions, judgments and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of\nbusiness capital allocations primarily as a result of\nupdates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes\nin RWA for each LOB.\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\nSegment Results – Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…       Co…                                Co…\nm…       &                                    &                                Co…\ne…       Co…                                In…                                Ba…\nr…       Ba…  20…       20…       20…       Ba…  20…       20…       20…       20…        20…          20…\nT…\nn…    $       55…  $    50…  $    51…    $  47…       $    51…  $    49…    $  11…     $       10…  $       9,…\nr…\nT…\nn…            31…       29…       27…       27…            25…       23…       4,…             4,…          3,…\ne…\nP…            23…       20…       23…       20…            26…       25…       6,…             5,…          5,…\np…\nP…\nf…            3,…       -6…       12…       1,…            -1…       2,…       1,…             -9…          2,…\nc…\nl…\nN…            14…       20…       8,…       14…            21…       17…       4,…             5,…          2,…\ni…\nR…\non            29%       41%       15%        14  %         25%       20%        16  %          21%          11%\ne…\n(…\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…       As…\nm…         &\ne…       We…\nr…       Ma…  20…       20…       20…       Cor…  20…       2021       20…       Tot…  20…       2021       20…\nT…\nn…    $  17…       $    16…  $    14…    $         80  $    -3,…  $    -1…    $        13…  $    125…  $    12…\nr…\nT…\nn…       11…            10…       9,…             1,…       1,8…       1,…             76…       71,…       66…\ne…\nP…       5,…            6,…       4,…             -9…       -5,…       -2…             56…       53,…       56…\np…\nP…\nf…       128            -2…       263              22         81        66             6,…       -9,…       17…\nc…\nl…\nN…       4,…            4,…       2,…             -7…       -3,…       -1…             37…       48,…       29…\ni…\nR…\non        25  %         33%       28%              NM         NM        NM             14%        19%       12%\ne…\n(…\nSelected Firmwide Metrics\nThe following tables present key metrics for Wealth\nManagement, which consists of the Global Private Bank\nin AWM and J.P.

63\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n2022 compared with 2021\nNet income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a\nnet increase in the provision for credit losses\ncompared with a net benefit in the prior year.\nNet revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.\nNet interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%,\npredominantly driven by:\nmargin expansion on higher rates as well as growth\nin deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”),\nand higher revolving loans in Card Services,\npartially offset by\nlower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in\nBWM, and tighter loan spreads in Home Lending.\nNoninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%,\nreflecting:\nlower production revenue from lower margins and\nvolume in Home Lending,\nlower auto operating lease income as a result of a\ndecline in volume, and\nlower card income reflecting higher amortization\nrelated to new account origination costs partially\noffset by higher annual fees in Card Services, while\nnet interchange income was relatively flat,\npartially offset by\nhigher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting\nthe absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in\nthe prior year primarily driven by updates to model\ninputs related to prepayment expectations, as well as\nhigher operating revenue on a higher level of third-\nparty loans serviced,\nhigher commissions reflecting travel-related\nservices in Card Services and increased annuity sales\nin BWM, and\nhigher deposit-related fees due to higher service\nfee volume in BWM.\nRefer to Note 6 for additional information on card\nincome and asset management, administration and\ncommissions.\nRefer to Note 15 for further information regarding\nchanges in the value of the MSR asset and related\nhedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\nNoninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%,\nreflecting:\ninvestments in the business and higher structural\nexpenses, predominantly driven by compensation,\ntechnology and marketing,\npartially offset by\nlower volume- and revenue-related expenses,\npredominantly driven by lower depreciation expense on\nlower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher\noperating losses.\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion,\ndriven by:\nnet charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8\nbillion in the prior year and included\n– a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting\nthe ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers.\nHowever, median deposit balances declined in the\nsecond half of 2022, impacted by the growth in\nconsumer spending,\nlargely offset by\n– a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto\nand BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited\nfrom government stimulus and payment assistance\nprograms, and\na $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses driven by\n– $950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher\noutstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction\nin the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty\nassociated with borrower behavior as the effects of\nthe pandemic gradually recede, and\n– $175 million in Home Lending.\nThe prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in\nthe\nallowance for credit losses across CCB.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 106-130 and Allowance for Credit

The\nFirm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,\naccording to Dealogic.\n– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down\n74%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion ,\ndow n 43%, due to lower issuance activity.\n– Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by\na lower level of announced deals.\nPayments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and\nincluded the net impact of equity investments.\nExcluding this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion,\nup 33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher\nrates and growth in fees on higher volumes.\nLending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by\nhigher net interest income primarily on higher loans,\nas well as fair value gains on hedges of retained\nloans, compared with losses in the prior year.\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6\nbillion, up 2%. Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up\n6%.\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up\n10%, driven by strong performance in the macro\nbusinesses amid volatile market conditions,\nparticularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets and\nRates, partially offset by lower revenue in\nSecuritized Products.\nEquity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%,\ndriven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely\noffset by Equity Derivatives.\nSecurities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%,\ndriven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and\ngrowth in fees, largely offset by lower average market\nvalues of assets under custody and lower deposits.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836\nmillion, reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a\nlesser extent, losses on exposures relating to\ncommodities and Russia and Russia-associated\ncounterparties, compared with a gain of $250 million\nin the prior year.\nNoninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven\nby higher structural expense and investments in the\nbusiness, including higher compensation, partially\noffset by lower revenue-related compensation as well\nas lower legal expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion,\npredominantly driven by a net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration\nin the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.\nThe provision for credit losses in the prior year was\na net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses.\n68    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31, (in millions, except headcount)\n2022                                                            2021                    2020\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets                                    $  1,334,296            $  1,259,896            $  1,095,926\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                    187,642                 159,786                 133,296\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                 42,304                  50,386                  39,588\nvalue(b)\nTotal loans                                          229,946                 210,172                 172,884\nEquity                                               103,000                  83,000                  80,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets                                    $  1,406,250            $  1,334,518            $  1,121,942\nTrading assets-debt and equity                       405,916                 448,099                 425,060\ninstruments\nTrading assets-derivative receivables                 77,802                  68,203                  69,243\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                    172,627                 145,137                 135,676\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                 46,846                  51,072                  33,792\nvalue(b)\nTotal loans                                          219,473                 196,209                 169,468\nEquity                                               103,000                  83,000                  80,000\nHeadcount                                             73,452                  67,546                  61,733\n(a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans,\nloans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for-\ninvestment loans and overdrafts.

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.\nMarkets revenue consists of principal transactions,\nfees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets\nbusiness performance on a total revenue basis, as\noffsets may occur across revenue line items. For\nexample, securities that generate net interest income\nmay be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected\nat fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer\nto Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition\nof these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise\nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal\ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon\nexecuting new transactions with market participants,\nas well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is\nrevenue recognized from gains and losses on\nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to,\nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments used by the Firm to actively manage the\nrisk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new\ntransactions with market participants is affected by\nmany factors including the level of client activity,\nthe bid-offer spread (which is the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an instrument\nto the Firm and the price at which another market\nparticipant is willing and able to buy it from the\nFirm, and vice versa), market liquidity and\nvolatility. These factors are interrelated and\nsensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market\nconditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity\nprices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.\n70    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized\nupon executing new transactions.\nYe…\nen…\nDe…\n31,\n(in\nmi…\nex…       2022                                2021                                2020\nwh…       Fix…                                Fix…                                Fix…\not…       Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…\nno…       Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…\nPr…    $  11,…    $  8,8…    $  20,…       $  7,9…    $  7,5…    $  15,…       $  11,…    $  6,0…    $  17,…\ntr…\nLe…\nand        303         22        325           321         17        338           226         10        236\nde…\nfe…\nAs…\nma…\nad…        550       2,0…       2,5…           545       1,9…       2,5…           411       2,0…       2,4…\nand\nco…\nAll\not…        916       -131        785           972       -101        871           493        -62        431\nin…\nNo…       13,…       10,…       24,…          9,7…       9,4…       19,…          12,…       8,1…       21,…\nre…\nNet\nin…       5,1…       -377       4,7…          7,1…       1,1…       8,2…          7,8…        483       8,3…\nin…\nTo…\nnet    $  18,…    $  10,…    $  28,…       $  16,…    $  10,…    $  27,…       $  20,…    $  8,6…    $  29,…\nre…\nLo…                                   7                                   4                                   4\nda…\n(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets, posted losses to total net revenue.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest\nincome was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in loans,\npredominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs and lower deposits. Noninterest revenue was $3.3\nbillion, down 15%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale positions,\nprimarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by a gain on\nan equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan. Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up\n17%, largely driven by higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as well as structural expense, including higher\ncompensation expense, and expense associated with growth in payments. The provision for credit losses was $1.3\nbillion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the\nFirm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth. The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit\nof $947 million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    73\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCB product revenue consists of the following:\nLendingincludes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily provided on a secured basis;\ncollateral includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.

Revenue from Asset Management was\n$8.8 billion, down 5%, predominantly driven by: • net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in the\nprior year and, • lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in market levels and the impact of net liquidity\noutflows, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Revenue from Global Private\nBank was $8.9 billion, up 16%, driven by: • margin expansion on higher rates and higher average deposits; and to a\nlesser extent higher average loans and wider spreads, partially offset by • lower brokerage and placement fees on\nreduced volume, and lower management fees. Noninterest expense was $11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by higher\nstructural expense and investments in the business, largely compensation. The provision for credit losses was $128\nmillion, driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in the prior\nyear was a net benefit of $227 million driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\n76    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nAsset Management has two high-level measures of\nits overall fund performance.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star:Mutual fund rating services rank\nfunds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star\nrating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and\nrepresents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable)\nMorningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual\nshare\nclass level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer\nthan three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned\npeer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating\nprovider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary\nshare class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides\nratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management\nin funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one,\nthree and five years):\nAll quartile rankings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive\nthese rankings are sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based on the\nnet-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on fund performance and associated\npeer rankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class”\nlevel to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds.

(b) Predominantly\nrelates to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.\n2022 compared with 2021 Net loss was $743 million, compared with a net loss of $3.7 billion in the prior year. Net\nrevenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5 billion driven by higher net interest income due to higher\nrates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue. Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8 billion, compared with\na gain of $68 million driven by: • higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government\nagency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, • the impact of\nmovements in foreign exchange on certain revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, • net\nlosses related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the related net interest income\nearned on those transactions, • net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment related to the\nFirm's international consumer growth initiatives, and • net losses on certain legacy private equity investments\ncompared with net gains in prior year. partially offset by • a gain on the sale of Visa B shares. In connection\nwith the sale, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares under which the Firm\nretains the risk associated with changes in the rate at which the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common\nshares (“Visa A shares”).

The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise\nfrom the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four\nmajor reportable business segments to serve their\nrespective client bases, which generate both on- and\noff-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Treasury and\nCIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability\nmanagement objectives generally by investing in high-\nquality securities that are managed for the longer-\nterm as part of the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to\nmeet the Firm ’ s asset-liability management\nobjectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on\nderivatives.

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its business, and the associated risks, in a\nmanner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data\nand management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;\nand\nA Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal governance\nand independent oversight by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm’s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited\nto, the economic environment, regulatory or government\npolicy, competitor or market evolution, business\ndecisions, process or judgment error, deliberate\nwrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural\ndisasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest\nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized\nin the following four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or inadequate\nresponses to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal\nor a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and\ninvestment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nrisk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings\nand capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to\nthe Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers,\nand regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s\nChief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and approval\nof the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the\nFirmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk\nOfficers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and\nthe Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in\nturn, establish Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance\npolicies and standards, and define and oversee the\nimplementation of the Firm’s risk governance\nframework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in\ntheir LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks\nthat span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and\nregions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is\nexpected to operate within the parameters identified\nby the IRM function, and within its own management-\nidentified risk and control standards.\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management. The first line of\ndefense own the identification of risks within their\nrespective organizations and the design and execution\nof controls to manage those risks.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    81\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations and implementation of the\nrisk governance framework established by IRM, which\nmay include policies, standards, limits, thresholds\nand controls.\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which\nis separate from, and independently assesses and\nchallenges, the first line of defense risk management\npractices. IRM is also responsible for the\nidentification of risks within its respective\norganization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and\nregulations and for the development and implementation\nof policies and standards with respect to its own\nprocesses.\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an\nindependent function that provides objective\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of\nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk\nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is headed by\nthe General Auditor, who reports to the Audit\nCommittee and administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute\nto the Firmwide control environment but are not\nconsidered part of a particular line of defense,\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These\nother functions are responsible for the identification\nof risks within their respective organizations,\nadherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations\nand implementation of the risk governance framework\nestablished by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks\nwithin their respective organizations, as well as the\ndesign and execution of controls, including IRM-\nspecified controls, to manage those risks. To support\nthis activity, the Firm has a risk identification\nframework designed to facilitate each LOB and\nCorporate’s responsibility to identify material risks\ninherent to the Firm’s business and operational\nactivities, catalog them in a central repository and\nreview material risks on a regular basis. The IRM\nfunction reviews and challenges the LOB and\nCorporate’s identified risks, maintains the central\nrepository and provides the consolidated Firmwide\nresults to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by\n“Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and\nqualitative risks. Periodically the Firm’s risk\nappetite is set and approved by senior management\n(including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board\nRisk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are\nassessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to\ntake risk consistent with its stated risk appetite.\nRisk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\n82    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is\nsupported by a risk governance and oversight structure\nthat provides channels for the escalation of risks and\nissues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of\nDirectors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the committees of the\nBoard of Directors and key senior management-level\ncommittees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight\nstructure. In addition, there are other committees,\nforums and channels of escalation that support the\noversight of risk that are not shown in the chart\nbelow or described in this Form 10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the\nFirm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),\nGeneral Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior\nexecutives, is accountable to and may refer matters to\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee\nis responsible for escalating to the Board the\ninformation necessary to facilitate the Board’s\nexercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm. This includes\nmonitoring the Firm’s financial performance and\ncondition and reviewing the strategic objectives and\nplans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant\nportion of its oversight responsibilities through its\nprincipal standing committees, each of which consists\nsolely of independent members of the Board. The Board\nRisk Committee is the principal committee that\noversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees\nthe control environment, and the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee oversees compensation\nand other management-related matters. Each committee\nof the Board oversees reputational risks, conduct\nrisks, and ESG matters within its scope of\nresponsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is\nresponsible for the oversight of management of the\nbank, which it discharges both acting directly and\nthrough the principal standing committees of the\nFirm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight\non behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Board\nRisk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively,\nand, with respect to compensation and other\nmanagement-related matters, the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its\noversight of management’s responsibility to implement\na global risk management framework reasonably designed\nto identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The\nBoard Risk Committee’s responsibilities include\napproval of applicable primary risk policies and\nreview of certain associated frameworks, analysis and\nreporting established by management. Breaches in risk\nappetite and parameters, issues that may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Firm, including capital\nand liquidity issues, and other significant risk-\nrelated matters are escalated to the Board Risk\nCommittee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight\nof management’s responsibility to ensure that there is\nan effective system of controls reasonably designed to\nsafeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the\nintegrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and\nmaintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and with laws and\nregulations. It also assists the Board in its\noversight of the qualifications, independence and\nperformance of the Firm’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, and of the performance of the\nFirm’s Internal Audit function.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    83\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee\n(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the\nFirm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC\nreviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and\nqualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the\nperformance of Operating Committee members against\ntheir goals, and approves their compensation awards.\nIn addition, the CEO’s award is subject to\nratification by the independent directors of the\nBoard. The CMDC also reviews the development of and\nsuccession for key executives. As part of the Board’s\nrole of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating\nthe “tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s\nculture, including reviewing updates from management\nregarding significant conduct issues and any related\nactions with respect to employees, including\ncompensation actions. The Public Responsibility\nCommittee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions\nand practices on public responsibility matters such as\ncommunity investment, fair lending, sustainability,\nconsumer practices and other public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm's values and character and could\nimpact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders.\nThe Committee also provides guidance on these matters\nto management and the Board, as appropriate. The\nCorporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises\ngeneral oversight with respect to the governance of\nthe Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications\nof and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for\nelection to the Board. The Committee evaluates and\nrecommends to the Board corporate governance practices\napplicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework\nfor assessing the Board’s performance and self-\nevaluation. Management oversight The Firm’s senior\nmanagement-level committees that are primarily\nresponsible for key risk-related functions include:\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s\nhighest management-level risk committee. It oversees\nthe risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides\na forum for discussion of topics, and issues that are\nraised or escalated by its members and other\ncommittees. The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is\nan escalation committee for senior management to\nreview and discuss the Firmwide operational risk\nenvironment including identified issues, operational\nrisk metrics and significant events that have been\nescalated. Line of Business and Regional Risk\nCommittees are responsible for overseeing the\ngovernance, limits, and controls that have been\nestablished within the scope of their respective\nactivities. These committees review the ways in which\nthe particular LOB or the businesses operating in a\nparticular region could be exposed to adverse\noutcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting,\nescalating and/or requiring remediation of matters\nbrought to these committees.\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the operational risk and control\nenvironment of their respective business or function,\ninclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct\nRisks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible\nfor reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks\nand other data that may impact the level of\noperational risk in a business or function, addressing\nkey operational risk issues , with an emphasis on\nprocesses with control concerns and overseeing control\nremediation. The Asset and Liability Committee\n(“ALCO”) is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\nasset and liability management (“ALM”), including the\nactivities and frameworks supporting management of the\nbalance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and\ncapital risk. The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum\n(“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk\nexecutives and is responsible for overseeing the\nmanagement of risks arising from valuation activities\nconducted across the Firm. Risk governance and\noversight functions The Firm manages its risk through\nrisk governance and oversight functions. The scope of\na particular function or business activity may include\none or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For\nexample, Country Risk Management oversees country risk\nwhich may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of\nexposures that could give rise to multiple risk types\nsuch as credit or market risk.

The Firm’s fortress balance sheet\nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong\ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk\nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-term\nstability to enable the Firm to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly\nstressed environments. Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm’s capital prior to making\nsignificant decisions that could impact future\nbusiness activities. In addition to considering the\nFirm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates\nall sources and uses of capital with a view to\nensuring the Firm’s capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose\nprimary objective is to provide independent oversight\nof capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital\nrisk limits and indicators, including capital risk\nappetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report\ncapital limit breaches;\nPerforming an assessment of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement activities, including changes made to the\nContingency Capital Plan described below; and\nConducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory\ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance with\napplicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital\nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to\nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the\ncycle and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future\ninvestment opportunities;\nPromote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of\nstrength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its insured\ndepository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all\ntimes under applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate\nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with the\nFirm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements\nand maintaining a strong capital governance framework.\nThe internal minimum capital levels consider the\nFirm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an\ninternal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal\neconomic cycles and in stress events;\nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range\nof potential events; and\nRegular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position\nand following prescribed escalation protocols, both at\nthe Firm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\ncapital management include the Capital Governance\nCommittee, the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional\nALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”)\nRisk Committee.

Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages\n81-84 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO\nand other risk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding\nCompanies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at\nleast annually a capital plan that has been reviewed\nand approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal\nReserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure\nthat large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods\nof economic and financial stress, and have robust,\nforward-looking capital assessment and planning\nprocesses in place that address each BHC’s unique\nrisks to enable it to absorb losses under certain\nstress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve\nevaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal\ncapital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as\nwell as its plans to make capital distributions, such\nas dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal\nReserve uses results under the severely adverse\nscenario from its supervisory stress test to determine\neach firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement\nfor the coming year.\nOn June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had\ncompleted the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test\nprocess. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve\naffirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up\nfrom 3.2%), and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital\nratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of\n12.0% (up from 11.2%). The 2022 SCB requirement became\neffective on October 1, 2022, and will remain in\neffect until September 30, 2023.\n86    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRefer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on\nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs\nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of\nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses\nof capital as well as compliance with supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing\nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving\nthe capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and\nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined\ncentrally and applied uniformly across the businesses.\nThese scenarios are articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of\nbusiness results; global market shocks, which generate\nshort-term but severe trading losses; and\nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios\nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition\nto CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management\nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and\nsensitivity analyses, as necessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s\napproach towards capital management in normal economic\nconditions and in stressed environments. The\nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm\ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing\nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and\nsets out the capital contingency actions that are\nexpected to be taken or considered at various levels\nof capital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC\nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital\nrequirements generally follow the Capital Accord of\nthe Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards\nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and\nbanks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount\nof regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-\nbalance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The\nFirm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are\ncurrently more binding than the Basel III Advanced\nrisk-based ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for\ncalculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and\nin the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk\nRWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk\nRWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches\nare that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is\nbased on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely\non the use of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-weightings which\nvary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a generally\nconsistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated\nunder these approaches, the Firm may supplement such\namounts to incorporate management judgment and\nfeedback from its regulators.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\nto calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for\nadditional information.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nCECL regulatory capital transition.\nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected\na two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by\nthe Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL\ncapital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year\nover a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022, the\nFirm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2\nbillion benefit associated with the CECL capital\ntransition provisions.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm\nphased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition\nprovisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL\naccounting guidance.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    87\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk .\nOn January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”),\nwhich replaced the Current Exposure Method used to\nmeasure derivatives counterparty exposure under the\nStandardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal\nmodels are not used, as well as leverage exposure used\nto calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital\nframework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking\nregulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased\nthe Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40\nbillion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of\napproximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio\nand a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure.\nIn addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the\nFirm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than\nStandardized RWA.\n88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1\ncapital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are\nrequired to hold additional levels of capital to serve\nas a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital\nconservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a\ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a\nfixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced\nregulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB\nrequirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized\nregulatory capital requirements.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject\nto the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB\nsurcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s\nassessment methodology, and is calculated by the\nFinancial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five\ncriteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.\n“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the\nMethod 1 requirements to include a measure of short-\nterm wholesale funding in place of substitutability,\nand introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    89\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB\nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021. For 2023, the Firm’s effective GSIB\nsurcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to\n2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\n2023         2022         2021\nMethod 1    2.5     %    2.0     %    2.0     %\nMethod 2    4.0     %    3.5     %    3.5     %\nOn November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which affirmed\nthe Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023. The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge\ncalculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2024. The Firm’s\nestimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB\nrule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical\ncapital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks\nfunction. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will\ncontinue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC\ndetermine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA\nsubject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the\nrisk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and\nany countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such\nas through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments. Risk-\nbased Capital Targets The Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0% for the\nfirst quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the\nGSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios\nmay vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules\ncurrently in effect. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier\nholding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt\n(“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional information.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to the\nBasel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1\ncapital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by\ntaking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital,\nand adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future\nexposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations\non the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as\nwell as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the\ncapital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the\nPrompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note\n27 for additional information. Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S.\nfederal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27.

Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities\ninclude:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk\nmetrics;\nIndependently establishing and monitoring limits and\nindicators, including liquidity risk appetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report\nlimit breaches;\nPerforming an independent review of liquidity risk\nmanagement processes to evaluate their adequacy and\neffectiveness based on LRM’s Independent Review\nFramework;\nMonitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal\nentity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined\nmetrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet\nvariances and funding activities; and\nApproving or escalating for review new or updated\nliquidity stress assumptions.\nLiquidity management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity\nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity\nmanagement are to:\nEnsure that the Firm’s core businesses and material\nlegal entities are able to operate in support of\nclient needs and meet contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations through normal economic cycles\nas well as during stress events, and\nManage an optimal funding mix and availability of\nliquidity sources.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nAnalyzing and understanding the liquidity\ncharacteristics of the assets and liabilities of the\nFirm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account\nlegal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;\nDeveloping internal liquidity stress testing\nassumptions;\nDefining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-\nspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and\ncontingency funding plans;\nManaging liquidity within the Firm’s approved\nliquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;\nManaging compliance with regulatory requirements\nrelated to funding and liquidity risk; and\nSetting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity\ncharacteristics of balance sheet assets and\nliabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet\nitems.\nAs part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management\nstrategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using\na centralized, global approach designed to:\nOptimize liquidity sources and uses;\nMonitor exposures;\nIdentify constraints on the transfer of liquidity\nbetween the Firm’s legal entities; and\nMaintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity\nat a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance\ninclude the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional\nALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nreviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for\nformal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances,\nliquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to\nFirmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for further\ndiscussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.\nInternal stress testing\nLiquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the\nFirm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of\nadverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as\npart of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning.\nStress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n(“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal\nentities on a regular basis, and other stress tests\nare performed in response to specific market events or\nconcerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the\nFirm’s contractual financial obligations are met and\ntake into consideration:\nVarying levels of access to unsecured and secured\nfunding markets;\nEstimated non-contractual and contingent cash\noutflows;\nConsiderations of credit rating downgrades;\nCollateral haircuts; and\nPotential impediments to the availability and\ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and\nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or\nother restrictions.\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time\nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both\nmarket and idiosyncratic stresses.\nResults of stress tests are considered in the\nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment\nof its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as\na source of funding for the Firm through equity and\nlong-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding\ncompany, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”),\nprovides funding support to the ongoing operations of\nthe Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm\nmaintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC,\nand operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to\ncomply with liquidity risk tolerances and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    97\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nminimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through\nperiods of stress when access to normal funding\nsources may be disrupted. Contingency funding plan The\nFirm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the\nstrategies for addressing and managing liquidity\nresource needs during a liquidity stress event and\nincorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and\nrisk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the\nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires\nthat the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain\nan amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet\ntheir respective estimated total net cash outflows\nover a prospective 30 calendar-day period of\nsignificant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered\nHQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations\nas defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-\nbank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows\nare based on standardized stress outflow and inflow\nrates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds,\nand obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum\nof 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation\nof the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                    Three months ended                                  December 31,\n(in millions)                      December 31, 2022        September 30, 2022                2021\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)               $             542,847     $             589,158     $       703,384\nEligible securities(b)(c)                    190,201                   126,913              34,738\nTotal HQLA(d)                  $             733,048     $             716,071     $       738,122\nNet cash outflows              $             652,580     $             635,072     $       664,801\nLCR                                              112  %                    113  %              111  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              80,468     $              80,999     $        73,321\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR                                              151  %                    165  %              178  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA       $             356,733     $             450,260     $       555,300\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks.\n(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable\nhaircuts under the LCR rule.

(d) Excludes\naverage excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with\nthe three months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily due\nto a reduction in cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average\nLCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year,\nreflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a\ndecline in deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for\nadditional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as\na result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the\nFirm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets\nreported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as\nequity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair\nvalue of these securities was approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease\nin excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. The Firm also had available\nborrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral\npledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible\nHQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and\nother central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased\ncredit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this\nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of\nliquidity.\n98    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required”\namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR\nrequirement, based on the Firm’s current\ninterpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its quarterly average\nNSFR semiannually beginning in the second half of\n2023.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    99\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including stable deposits,\nsecured and unsecured funding in the capital markets\nand stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary\nfunding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access\nfunding through short- or long-term secured\nborrowings, through the issuance of unsecured\nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The\nFirm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from\nlong-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured\nborrowings which are primarily securities loaned or\nsold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is\ninvested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment\nsecurities portfolio or deployed in cash or other\nshort-term liquid investments based on their interest\nrate and liquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on\noff–balance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,                                         Average\n(in millions)                                       2022            2021            2022            2021\nConsumer & Community Banking                $  1,131,611    $  1,148,110    $  1,162,680    $  1,054,956\nCorporate & Investment Bank                      689,893         707,791         739,700         760,048\nCommercial Banking                               271,342         323,954         294,180         301,343\nAsset & Wealth Management                        233,130         282,052         261,489         230,296\nCorporate                                         14,203             396           9,866             511\nTotal Firm                                  $  2,340,179    $  2,462,303    $  2,467,915    $  2,347,154\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce\nthe Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.\nA significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are\nconsumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,\nwhich are both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends than\nperiod-end deposit balances. However, during periods\nof market disruption those trends could be affected.\nAverage deposits were higher for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December\n31, 2021, reflecting:\ngrowth in CCB from existing and new accounts across\nboth consumer and small business customers, partially\noffset by a decline in deposits starting in the second\nhalf of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending,\nand\nnet inflows in AWM resulting from the residual\neffects of certain government actions, partially\noffset by migration into investments starting in the\nsecond quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising\ninterest rate environment\npartially offset by\nlower average deposits in CIB and CB due to\nattrition, also as a result of the rising interest\nrate environment.\nPeriod-end deposits decreased reflecting:\nattrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating\ndeposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of\nstructured notes in Markets,\nnet outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising\ninterest rate environment, and\na decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB\ndue to higher customer spending, predominantly offset\nby net inflows into new accounts.\nThe increase in deposits for both spot and averages in\nCorporate was driven by the Firm's international\nconsumer growth initiatives.\nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment\nResults on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively,\nfor further information on deposit and liability\nbalance trends.\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance protection\nthat provides additional funding stability and results\nin a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection\nmay be available to depositors in the countries in\nwhich the deposits are placed. For example, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)\nprovides deposit insurance protection for deposits\nplaced in a U.S. depository institution. At December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured\ndeposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating\ndeposits.\n100    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits.

Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at December 31,\n2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher\nsecured financing of trading assets in Markets,\npartially offset by lower secured financing of AFS\ninvestment securities in Treasury and CIO.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds.\nThe decrease in period-end commercial paper and the\nincrease in average balances for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior\nyear periods, was due to changes in net issuance\nlevels primarily for short-term liquidity management.\n102    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLong-term funding and issuance\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market\naccess and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating\nits optimal long-term funding plan.\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its\nliquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm\nbelieves that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to\nliquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\nin Note 5 for additional information on the impact of\na credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements\nfor VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral\nagreements.\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the\nFirm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of\nDecember 31, 2022, were as follows:\nJ.P.\nMorgan\nSecuri…\nLLC\nJ.P.\nMorgan\nSecuri…\nJPMorgan                           plc\nJPMorgan                           Chase                              J.P.\nChase &                            Bank,                              Morgan\nDecemb…    Co.

The Firm provides credit to a variety of\nclients and customers, ranging from large corporate\nand institutional clients to individual consumers and\nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm\nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home\nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with\nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through\nits operating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages\ncredit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk\nmanagement governance includes the following\nactivities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including transaction\nand exposure approval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting\nguidelines\nAssigning and managing credit authorities in\nconnection with the approval of credit exposure\nManaging criticized exposures and delinquent loans,\nand\nEstimating credit losses and supporting appropriate\ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor\nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring\ncredit risk vary depending on several factors,\nincluding type of asset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g.,\ndelinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk management and\ncollection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of\nan obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm\nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses\nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and\nthe allowance for investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and\nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on\npages 149-152 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital\nand represent the potential volatility of actual\nlosses relative to the established allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The analyses\nfor these losses include stress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined\ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic\nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress\ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional\nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry\nand country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary.\nThe Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on\nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as\nwell as to assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of\nthe approval and decision-making process for extending\ncredit so that credit risks are assessed accurately,\napproved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval\nauthorities, concentration limits, risk-rating\nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In\naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used\nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and\nother trends, including any concentrations at the\nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be\naddressed through changes in underwriting policies and\nportfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends against\nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and trends are\nincorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer\ncredit losses and are part of the monitoring of the\ncredit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client\nand counterparty level with established concentration\nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as\ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure\nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk\nthat exposure to a counterparty is positively\ncorrelated with the impact of a default by the same\ncounterparty, which could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to\nmeet its obligations is decreasing.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval processes\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent\nCredit Review function is responsible for:\nI ndependently validating or changing the risk\ngrades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk\ngrade changes initiated by responsible business units;\nand\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper\nmonitoring and management of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading policies and\nunderwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio\nreporting of industry, clients, counterparties and\ncustomers, product and geography are prepared, and the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly\nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance\nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are\nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk\ncommittees, senior management and the Board of\nDirectors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    107\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

The\nfollowing discussions provide information concerning\nindividual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation about this portfolio, including\ninformation about delinquencies, loan modifications\nand other credit quality indicators. Residential real\nestate: The residential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans increased\ncompared to December 31, 2021 reflecting originations,\nnet of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased\nfrom December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit\nperformance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the\nprior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher\ninterest rates, partially offset by lower gross\ncharge-offs. Loans at fair value decreased from\nDecember 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home\nLending outpaced originations due to higher interest\nrates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase\nactivity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased\nfrom December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio\nactivity in CIB. The carrying value of home equity\nlines of credit outstanding was $15.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion\nof HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully\namortizing payments or have been modified and $5.0\nbillion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which\nprimarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk\nof HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or\nreducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk profile. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans were $36.3\nbillion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The\ninterest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio\nreflected net recoveries for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is\ncomparable with the performance of the broader prime\nmortgage portfolio.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.

The portfolio decreased when\ncompared with December 31, 2021 due to paydowns of\nscored Auto loans and PPP loan forgiveness in Business\nBanking predominantly offset by originations of scored\nAuto loans.

The December 31,\n2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and\n0.68%, respectively, increased compared to the\nDecember 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of\n1.04% and 0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nNet charge-offs decreased for the year ended December\n31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Delinquency and\nnet charge-off rates continue to benefit from the\nongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However,\nmedian deposit balances declined in the second half of\n2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending.\nConsistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until charged\noff. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nincludes the estimated uncollectible portion of\naccrued and billed interest and fee income.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the\ntotal retained credit card loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida\nand Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nModifications of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of\ncredit card loans outstanding that have been modified\nin TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31,\n2021. These TDRs do not include loans with short-term\nor other insignificant modifications that are not\nconsidered TDRs.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about delinquencies,\ngeographic and FICO composition, and modifications.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    115\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating\nservices (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with\nbanks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client\nconcentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto\ndealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan\nlosses. In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low. As of December 31,\n2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion driven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization,\npartially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio\nactivity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset\nby net portfolio activity in AWM and CB. As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio\nremained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3\nbillion. As of December 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in\nlending-related commitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled\ncommitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-\nassociated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

Total criticized exposure,\nexcluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively.\nCriticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in\nConsumer & Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific\ndowngrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and\n$28.6 billion was performing.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The contractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum possible credit risk\nshould the clients draw down on these commitments or\nwhen the Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or\nexpired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that\nthe total contractual amount of these wholesale\nlending-related commitments is representative of the\nFirm’s expected future credit exposure or funding\nrequirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information\non wholesale lending-related commitments. Receivables\nfrom customers Receivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients\nin CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage\nits credit risk, the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required margin levels\non an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit\nadditional cash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These receivables are\nreported within accrued interest and accounts\nreceivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk, including credit risk\nand risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities prices.\nThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to\nwhich the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the\nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),\nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also\nbe exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP.\nWhere possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit\nrisk exposures arising from derivative contracts\nthrough the use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage\nof the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to\ncollateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled\ndaily — was approximately 87% and 88% at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for\nadditional information on the Firm’s use of collateral\nagreements and further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and settlement types. The\nfair value of derivative receivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and\n$57.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The increase was primarily driven by\nhigher foreign exchange as a result of market\nmovements. Derivative receivables represent the fair\nvalue of the derivative contracts after giving effect\nto legally enforceable master netting agreements and\nthe related cash collateral held by the Firm. In\naddition, the Firm held liquid securities and other\ncash collateral that may be used as security when the\nfair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s\nfavor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid\nsecurities is consistent with the definition of high\nquality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In\nmanagement’s view, the appropriate measure of current\ncredit risk should also take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents securities that\ndo not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the\nLCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral\namounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for each\ncounterparty. The Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities,\nother liquid government agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and equity securities)\ndelivered by clients at the initiation of\ntransactions, as well as collateral related to\ncontracts that have a non-daily call frequency and\ncollateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has\nnot yet settled as of the reporting date. Although\nthis collateral does not reduce the balances and is\nnot included in the tables below, it is available as\nsecurity against potential exposure that could arise\nshould the fair value of the client’s derivative\ncontracts move in the Firm’s favor.

To capture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates,\non a client-by-client basis, three measures of\npotential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak,\nDerivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average\nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level\nover the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used\nas an input for aggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value\nof the Firm’s derivative exposure, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG\nover the total life of the derivative contract is used\nas the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used\nto calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further\ndescribed below.\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in\nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the\ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In\naddition, the Firm’s risk\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-way\nrisk, which is broadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is positively correlated\nwith the impact of a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase at the same\ntime as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its\nobligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence\nthe nature and magnitude of these correlations over\ntime. To the extent that these correlations are\nidentified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated\nwith a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk\nmanages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into\ncredit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate,\nforeign exchange, equity and commodity derivative\ncontracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s\ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years\nas calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The\nthree measures generally show that exposure will\ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    125\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-\nmaker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit\nportfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate\nthe credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management\nactivities”). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also\nuses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain\nsecurities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses.

(b) Prior-period\namount has been revised to conform with the current\npresentation The credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities do not qualify for\nhedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives\nare reported at fair value, with gains and losses\nrecognized in principal transactions revenue. In\ncontrast, the loans and lending-related commitments\nbeing risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual\nbasis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between\nloans and lending-related commitments and the credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility that is not\nrepresentative, in the Firm’s view, of the true\nchanges in value of the Firm’s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps\n(“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may\nvary depending on a number of factors, including the\nnamed reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience\nlosses on specific exposures that are different than\nthe named reference entities in the purchased CDS);\nthe contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a\ndefined credit event that does not align with an\nactual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of\nthe Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be\nshorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm\ngenerally seeks to purchase credit protection with a\nmaturity date that is the same or similar to the\nmaturity date of the exposure for which the protection\nwas purchased, and remaining differences in maturity\nare actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

The Firm’s\nallowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance\nfor loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the\nallowance for lending-related commitments, which is\nreflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, and • the allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities, which is\nreflected in investment securities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31,\n2022 was $22.2 billion , reflecting a net addition of\n$3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of:\n$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in\nthe Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth,\npredominantly in CB and CIB, and • $1.2 billion in\nconsumer, predominantly driven by Card Services,\nreflecting higher outstanding balances and\ndeterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook,\npartially offset by a reduction in the allowance\nrelated to a decrease in uncertainty associated with\nborrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic\ngradually recede. Deterioration in the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook included both updates to the\ncentral scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which\nnow reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact\nof the increased weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due\nto the effects associated with higher inflation,\nchanges in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks,\nincluding the war in Ukraine. The Firm's allowance for\ncredit losses is estimated using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the table below, resulting in\na weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at\n5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower\nU.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2022\n2Q23       4Q23       2Q24\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       —  %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22       4Q22       2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December 31,\n2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was\n$629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages\n79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the\ninvestment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages\n97-104 for further information on related liquidity\nrisk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138\nfor further information on the market risk inherent in\nthe portfolio. Governance and oversight Investment\nsecurities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk\nAppetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk\nCommittee with regular updates provided to the Board\nRisk Committee. The Firm’s independent control\nfunctions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including capital\nand credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The Firm’s investments will continue to evo\nlve in line with its strategies, including the Firm’s\ncommitment to support underserved communities and\nminority-owned businesses.

Governance and oversight\nThe Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is\nconsistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.\nThe Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy\nframework for all principal investing activities that\nincludes approval by executives who are independent\nfrom the investing businesses, as appropriate. The\nFirm’s independent control functions are responsible\nfor reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying\nvalue of investments in accordance with relevant\npolicies. As part of the risk governance structure,\napproved levels for investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or segment in\norder to manage the overall size of the portfolios.\nThe Firm also conducts stress testing on these\nportfolios using specific scenarios that estimate\nlosses based on significant market moves and/or other\nrisk events.\n130    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of\nassets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies\nand procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for\nthe following functions:\nMaintaining a market risk policy framework\nIndependently measuring, monitoring and controlling\nLOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\nDefining, approving and monitoring of limits\nPerforming stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and\ntherefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics,\nboth statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk\nincluding:\nValue-at-risk (VaR)\nStress testing\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nEarnings-at-risk\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting limits,\nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration\nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity,\naccommodation of client business, and management\njudgment. Market Risk Management maintains different\nlevels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and\nstress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented\nby certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit\nand loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis.\nLimits that have not been reviewed within specified\ntime periods by Market Risk Management are reported to\nsenior management. The LOBs and Corporate are\nresponsible for adhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely\nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In the event of a\nbreach, Market Risk Management consults with senior\nmembers of appropriate groups within the Firm to\ndetermine the suitable course of action required to\nreturn the applicable positions to compliance, which\nmay include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the\nbreach or granting a temporary increase in limits to\naccommodate an expected increase in client activity\nand/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or\nLOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur. For additional discussion on\nmodel uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 148.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    131\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions\nwhich give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous\n12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are representative\nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the\nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that\nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made\nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification\nacross product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results\nare reported to senior management, the Board of\nDirectors and regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market\nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product\ntypes. To capture material market risks as part of the\nFirm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses\nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR\nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk\nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as\nsensitivities and historical time series used to\ngenerate daily market values may be different across\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR\nmodel results across all portfolios are aggregated at\nthe Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time horizons, and\nother factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict\nlosses, particularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm\nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It\nis likely that using an actual price-based time series\nfor these products, if available, would affect the VaR\nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its\nmarket risk positions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be\ndifferent than the independent third-party data\ncollected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data sources may\ndiffer. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for\nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process.\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, it may not be\npractical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly\nvaluation process for VaR model calculations.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 148 for information regarding model\nreviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR\nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory\nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital\nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently\nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an\nexpected tail loss methodology which approximates a\n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to\n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital\nrules, which may be different than the positions\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the\ndiversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm’s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other components\nof market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g.,\nVaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the\nrespective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    133\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and\nrisk types.\n(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of\nCVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit\nspreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.\nThis exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market\nresulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR.\n(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity\nposition in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components,\nand consequently, diversification benefit is not meaningful.\nAverage Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior year.\nThe increase was driven by the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market\nobserved in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by a decrease in Corporate and other\nLOB VaR.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below\ndo not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those\nassociated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk\nmanagement activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel\nIII capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior\nday. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent\nwith the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five\ntimes every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed\n17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income\nMarkets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which\ncompose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in\nbacktesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12\nmonths and three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the\ncorresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty\npercentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one\nhundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk\nsection of the Firm’ s B asel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory\nVaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    135\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nOther risk measures\nStress testing\nAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool\nused to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but\npossible economic and market scenarios. The results\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for\nthose potential losses and are measured against\nlimits.\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of\npotential stress for both market rallies and market\nsell-offs, assuming significant changes in market\nfactors such as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array\nof hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on\ntail events in specific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact multiple market\nfactors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate\nspecific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk\nbetween different products. The flexibility in the\nstress framework allows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible\nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are\nreported periodically to senior management of the\nFirm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk\nStress Methodology Committee reviews and approves\nchanges to stress testing methodology and scenarios\nacross the Firm. Significant changes to the framework\nare escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board\nof Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework,\nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance.\nA profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the\nFirm’s traditional banking activities, which include\nextension of loans and credit facilities, taking\ndeposits, issuing debt and the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a\nsummary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk .\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk policy and related\nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board\nRisk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews it\nwith senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk\nfunction reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function\nis responsible for providing independent oversight and\ngovernance around assumptions and establishing and\nmonitoring limits for structural interest rate risk.\nThe Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities portfolio\nand interest rate derivatives.\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments\nas interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide\nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate\nrisk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer\npricing, which takes into account the elements of\ninterest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in\nfinancial markets. These elements include asset and\nliability balances and contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment schedules, expected\nprepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest\nrates and, in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes\nto this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets\nand liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained loans,\n136    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment securities,\nlong-term debt and any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk\nmanagement VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 132. Earnings-at-risk scenarios\nestimate the potential change to a net interest income\nbaseline over the following 12 months utilizing\nmultiple assumptions. These scenarios include a\nparallel shift involving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper\nyield curve involving holding short-term rates\nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter\nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different factors, including:\nThe impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other factors\nwhich are updated periodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in\nthe Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular\ntime, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve\nmay take as part of monetary policy, including through\nthe use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In\naddition, there are other factors that impact the\namount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level\nof loans across the industry and competition for\ndeposits. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent the amount by which\ndeposit rates paid could change upon a given change in\nmarket interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these\nscenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due\nto repricing lags and other factors. The Firm’s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated\nand enhanced in response to changes in the composition\nof the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market\nconditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and\nother factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the\nmodeling of repricing lags for deposits in its\nearnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing\nlags, in the current environment, would significantly\naffect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with\nhigher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a\npositive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios\nexpected to result in a negative impact, on the Firm’s\nearnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the\nFirm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk\nanalysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s\nnet interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for\nadditional information) . The Firm’s U.S. dollar\nsensitivities are presented in the table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\nParallel shift:                          2022       2021\n+100 bps shift in rates               $  -2.0    $   5.0\n-100 bps shift in rates                   2.4             NM    -a\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates         0.8        1.8\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates        3.2             NM    -a\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates       -2.8        3.2\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates        -0.9             NM    -a\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these\nscenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The change in the Firm’s U.S.\ndollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022 compared\nto December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm’s\nbaseline for higher interest rates and higher\ncorresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the\n+/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in\nrates is primarily the result of a greater impact from\nliabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets\nrepricing, while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-\nterm rates is primarily the result of a greater impact\nfrom assets repricing compared to the impact of\nliabilities repricing.

The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital\ninvestments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of\nthe Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on\npage 62 for additional information.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to\nchanges in relevant market variables.

The Country Risk Management group actively\nmonitors the various portfolios which may be impacted\nby these developments and measures the extent to which\nthe Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s\nstrategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that assesses, manages and\nmonitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes\nthe following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards\nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks\nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and\nstress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting\ntrends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling\nmodels and ratings indicators, for early\nidentification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of\nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero\nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities\nwhich result in contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country exposure\nmeasure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not\nsuitable for attribution to an\nindividual country. The use of different measurement\napproaches or assumptions could affect the amount of\nreported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\nDeposits with banks are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central banks, commercial banks,\nand other financial institutions\nLending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their\nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral\nreceived\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair\nvalue of all positions, including both long and short\npositions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives exposure is measured at the net\nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for\nthe same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the\nfair value of the derivative receivable or payable,\nreflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these\nexposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    139\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims\nto estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements\nto a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management\nperiodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of\ncountries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and\ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as\nnecessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk\nManagement to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management\npurposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special\nAdministrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with\nwhich they are associated. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit\nconditions. Country exposures may fluct uate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The\nincrease in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash\nplacements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.\nThe decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia\nand government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits\nresulting from higher interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million.\nThis amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement\nDepository.

Climate change is\nviewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing\ntypes of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is\ncategorized into physical risk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial\nloss associated with a changing climate. Acute\nphysical risk drivers include the increased frequency\nor severity of climate and weather events, such as\nfloods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic\nphysical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in\nthe climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent\nchanges in precipitation levels and increases in\naverage ambient temperatures.\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic\nimplications associated with a societal adjustment to\na low-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include\npossible changes in public policy, adoption of new\ntechnologies and shifts in consumer preferences.\nTransition risks may also be influenced by changes in\nthe physical climate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that\nis responsible for establishing the Firmwide framework\nand strategy for managing climate risk. The Climate\nRisk Management function engages across the Firm to\nhelp integrate climate risk considerations into\nexisting risk management frameworks, as appropriate.\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\nSetting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across the\nFirm\nDeveloping metrics, scenarios, and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of potential\nclimate-related financial and economic impacts to the\nFirm\nEstablishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy\nand the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of climate\nrisks present in their business activities and for\nadherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules\nand regulations.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating\nclimate risk management into existing governance\nframeworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as\nappropriate.\nThe LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are\nresponsible for providing the Board Risk Committee\nwith information on significant climate risks and\nclimate-related initiatives, as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    141\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes\nor systems; human factors; or external events\nimpacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational\nRisk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest\nitself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,\nbusiness disruptions (including those caused by\nextraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or\nfailure of vendors or other third party providers to\nperform in accordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of the\nFirm’s financial position, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and regulatory\nenvironments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk\n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable\nthe Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and\ntest, manage and report on the Firm’s operational\nrisk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management\nOrganization, which consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the\nday-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and\nFRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nis responsible for defining the CCOR Management\nFramework and establishing the minimum standards for\nits execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead\nOfficers report to the Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are\nindependent of the respective businesses or functions\nthey oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is\nincluded in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy\nthat is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their\nrespective control environment to assess where\ncontrols have failed, and to determine where\nremediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s\nOperational Risk and Compliance organization\n(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight\nof and challenge to these evaluations and may also\nperform independent assessments of significant\noperational risk events and areas of concentrated or\nemerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the control\nenvironments and reporting the results to senior\nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses\noperational risks through quantitative means,\nincluding operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital\nestimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”)\nstatistical model, which simulates the frequency and\nseverity of future operational risk loss projections\nbased on historical data. The LDA model is used to\nestimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a\none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level.\nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal operational\nrisk losses in the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after\nthe issues or business activities giving rise to the\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the\nFirm’s operational risk-based capital methodology,\nwhich uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),\nincorporates internal and external losses as well as\nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of\nkey business environment and internal control metrics.\nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in\nits AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The\nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR\nand other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in connection\nwith their independent monitoring and testing\ncompliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules\nand regulations. Through monitoring and testing,\nOperational Risk and Compliance independently identify\nareas of heightened operational risk and tests the\neffectiveness of controls within the LOBs and\nCorporate.\n142    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation of\naction plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational\nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate\nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed.\nOperational Risk and Compliance has established\nstandards designed to ensure that consistent\noperational risk reporting and operational risk\nreports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by\nthe LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the\nevaluation of key risk and performance indicators\nagainst established thresholds as well as the\nassessment of different types of operational risk\nagainst stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce\nescalation protocols to senior management and to the\nBoard of Directors.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.\nOperational risk subcategories include Compliance\nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and\nModel risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148,\nrespectively for more information on Compliance,\nConduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of operational risks\nsuch as cybersecurity, business and technology\nresiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing\nare provided below.\nWar in Ukraine and Sanctions\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial\nand economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and\nRussia-associated entities and individuals by various\ngovernments around the world, including the\nauthorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions\nare complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues\nto face increased operational risk associated with\naddressing these complex compliance-related matters.\nTo manage this increased risk, the Firm has\nimplemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate\nthe risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with\nsanctioned persons or in property subject to\nsanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as\nrequired by the applicable regulations.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure\nto harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of\ntechnology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is\nan important and continuously evolving focus for the\nFirm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting\nand enhancing the security of computer systems,\nsoftware, networks, storage devices, and other\ntechnology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties\nattempting to obtain access to confidential\ninformation, destroy data,\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause\nother damage.\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will\ncontinue to experience, a higher volume and complexity\nof cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened\ngeopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented\nprecautionary measures and controls reasonably\ndesigned to address this increased risk, such as\nenhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance\nthat the measures taken by the Firm will be successful\nin defending against cyber attacks.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to\npotential new threats as well as expanded regulatory\nscrutiny including the introduction of new\ncybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make\nsignificant investments in enhancing its cyber defense\ncapabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with\nthe appropriate government and law enforcement\nagencies and other businesses in order to understand\nthe full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the\noperating environment, enhance defenses and improve\nresiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm\nactively participates in discussions and simulations\nof cybersecurity risks both internally and with law\nenforcement, government officials, peer and industry\ngroups, and has significantly increased efforts to\neducate employees and certain clients on the topic of\ncybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or\nthat facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g.,\nvendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses,\ncentral depositories, and financial intermediaries)\nare also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.\nThird party cybersecurity incidents such as system\nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of\nsuch parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware\nand supply-chain compromises, could affect their\nability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or\nresult in lost or compromised information of the Firm\nor its clients. Clients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information\nassets, particularly when their activities and systems\nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control\nsystems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and\nongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients\nregarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to\nimprove security. However, where cybersecurity\nincidents occur as a result of client failures to\nmaintain the security of their own systems and\nprocesses, clients are responsible for losses\nincurred.\nTo help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources\nand information, the Firm maintains a Information\nSecurity Program designed to prevent, detect, and\nrespond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is\nperiodically provided with updates on the Firm’s\nInformation Security Program, recommended changes,\ncybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts\nto improve security, as well as the Firm’s efforts\nregarding significant cybersecurity events. In\naddition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident\nresponse\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    143\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nplan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to\nattempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such\nresponses with law enforcement and other government\nagencies, and notify clients and customers, as\napplicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is\ndesigned to mitigate the risk of insider trading\nconnected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes\nvarious escalation points.\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls\norganization, working with each of the Firm’s LOBs and\nCorporate, is responsible for identifying technology\nand cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the\ncontrols to manage threats. The organization consists\nof business aligned information security personnel\nthat are supported within the organization by the\nfollowing products and services that execute the\nInformation Security Program for the Firm:\nCyber Operations\nIdentity & Access Management\nGovernance, Risk & Controls\nGlobal Technology Product Security\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls\ngovernance structure is designed to identify,\nescalate, and mitigate information security risks.\nThis structure uses key governance forums to\ndisseminate information and monitor technology\nefforts. These forums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to\nescalate information security risks or other matters\nas appropriate.\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities\ndesigned to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risk.\nThe Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes\ntraining that reinforces the Firm's Information\nTechnology Risk and Security Management policies,\nstandards and practices, as well as the expectation\nthat employees comply with these policies. The\nSecurity Awareness Program engages personnel through\ntraining on how to identify potential cybersecurity\nrisks and protect the Firm’s resources and\ninformation. This training is mandatory for all\nemployees globally on a periodic basis, and it is\nsupplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives,\nincluding periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides\nspecialized security training for certain employee\nroles such as application developers. Finally, the\nFirm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees\nto take periodic awareness training on data privacy.\nThis privacy-focused training includes information\nabout confidentiality and security, as well as\nresponding to unauthorized access to or use of\ninformation.\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s\ncontrol such as the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications\nloss, failure of a third party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide\nBusiness Resiliency Program is designed to enable the\nFirm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover\nfrom business disruptions including occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control that may impact\ncritical business functions and supporting assets\n(i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third\nparties). The program includes governance, awareness\ntraining, planning and testing of recovery strategies,\nas well as strategic and tactical initiatives to\nidentify, assess, and manage business interruption and\npublic safety risks.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The Firm employs various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well as providing\nemployee and client education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers and other third parties to a high level\nof operational performance and to mitigate key risks,\nincluding data loss and business disruptions. The\nCorporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible\nfor Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and\nstandards.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm.\nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers\nand maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park\nAssurance Company. Insurance may also be required by\nthird parties with whom the Firm does business.\n144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-\nregulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership\nof and accountability for managing their compliance\nrisk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\nOrganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”),\nwhich is independent of the LOBs and Corporate,\nprovides independent review, monitoring and oversight\nof business operations with a focus on compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the\ndelivery of the Firm’s products and services to\nclients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs\nand Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks\nrelated to financial products and services,\nrelationships and interactions with clients and\ncustomers, and employee activities. For example,\ncompliance risks include those associated with anti-\nmoney laundering compliance, trading activities,\nmarket conduct, and complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations related to the offering of products\nand services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance\nrisk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary\nactivities, including the failure to exercise the\napplicable standard of care to act in the best\ninterest of fiduciary clients and customers or to\ntreat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance\nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s\nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\ncompliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR\nManagement Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE\nfor Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nalso provides regular updates to the Board Risk\nCommittee and the Audit Committee on significant\ncompliance risk issues, as appropriate.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets\nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will\nconduct themselves with integrity at all times and\nprovides the principles that govern employee conduct\nwith clients, customers, shareholders and one another,\nas well as with the markets and communities in which\nthe Firm does business. The Code requires employees to\npromptly report any potential or actual violation of\nthe Code, any Firm policy, or any law or regulation\napplicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires\nemployees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct\nthat violates the underlying principles of the Code,\nby any of the Firm’s employees, clients, customers,\nsuppliers, contract workers, business partners, or\nagents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees\nupon joining the Firm, and to current employees\nperiodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are\nrequired to affirm their compliance with the Code\nannually.\nEmployees can report any potential or actual\nviolations of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct\nHotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is\nanonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions\nwhere laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is\navailable at all times globally, with translation\nservices. It is administered by an outside service\nprovider. The Code prohibits retaliation against\nanyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith.\nPeriodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on\nthe Code of Conduct program.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    145\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk that any action or misconduct by an employee\ncould lead to unfair client or customer outcomes,\nimpact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm\noperates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise\nthe Firm’s reputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying\nand managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate\nengagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture\nconsistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business\nPrinciples (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as\na guide for how employees are expected to conduct\nthemselves.

The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital\nrequirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating\nthe allowance for credit losses and making business\ndecisions. A dedicated independent function, Model\nRisk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and\ngoverns the Firm’s policies relating to the management\nof model risk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, such as\nthose used in risk management, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent\napproach which is used for models, as described in\ndetail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the Firm based on the specific purposes of such\nmodels. Users and developers of models are responsible\nfor developing, implementing and testing their models,\nas well as referring models to MRGR for review and\napproval. Once models have been approved, model users\nand developers are responsible for maintaining a\nrobust operating environment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing\nbasis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the portfolios and in\nproduct and market developments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling techniques and\nsystems capabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated\nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In\nits review of a model, MRGR considers whether the\nmodel is suitable for the specific purposes for which\nit will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes\nand challenges the model methodology and the\nreasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform\nor require additional testing, including back-testing\nof model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the\nappropriate level of management within MRGR based on\nthe relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well\nas material changes to existing models, prior to their\nuse. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be\ngranted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be\nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to\nmitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the\ninterim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of\nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly\ntrue when the current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed, as\nthe Firm experienced during the early stages of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics\nto inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to\nmodel outputs than would otherwise be the case.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\n148    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its reported\nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm’s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance\nfor credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional\nU.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nreal GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S.\ninterest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 127 and in Note 13 , the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment\nrate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the\neight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of\napproximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023;\nlower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining\nnearly 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.9%\nin the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI\nwith a peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the\nthird quarter of 2024.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses, for\na number of reasons, including:\nThe allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the central\nscenario due to the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios.\nThe impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables.\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December\n31, 2022, the\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    149\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative\nadverse scenario to its central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: • An increase of approximately\n$500 million for residential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and\nthat its estimates of expected credit losses were\nreasonable and appropriate for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022 .\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nincluding certain mortgage, home equity and other\nloans, where the carrying value is based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair\nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in\nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with\neach business combination is allocated to the related\nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated market\ncost of equity, as well as actual business results and\nprojections of business performance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the\nreporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by\nat least 10% and there was no indication of a\nsignificant risk of goodwill impairment based on\ncurrent projections and valuations.\nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are\nconsistent with management’s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best\nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in\nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of December 31, 2022.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an\neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety\nof rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form\nof account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm\nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected\nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is\naccrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is\nreduced when the cardholder redeems points. This\nliability was $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was driven by continued growth in rewards\npoints earned on increased cardholder spending and\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout\n2022.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate\n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions. These\nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and\nmanagement judgment. Updates\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    151\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nto these assumptions will impact the rewards\nliability. As of December 31, 2022, a combined\nincrease of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in\nCPP would increase the rewards liability by\napproximately $315 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be\nsubject to different interpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of accounting for income\ntaxes, including the provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must\nmake assumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain items\nmay affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\njurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by the\nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where\nthe Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding\nits view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities\nmay be settled by audit, administrative appeals or\nadjudication in the court systems of the tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan\nChase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed\nadditional income taxes as a result of the resolution\nof these matters, and the Firm records additional\nunrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In\naddition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income\ntaxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results\nof operations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets\nand liabilities measured for financial reporting\nversus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets\nare recognized if, in management’s judgment, their\nrealizability is determined to be more likely than not\n. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of\na change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax\ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs\nregular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews include\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions regarding\nfuture taxable income , including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be available\nto utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In\nconnection with these reviews, if it is determined\nthat a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a\nvaluation allowance is\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed\nin a subsequent reporting period if the Firm\ndetermines that, based on revised estimates of future\ntaxable income or changes in tax planning strategies,\nit is more likely than not that all or part of the\ndeferred tax asset will become realizable. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, management has determined it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will realize its\ndeferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation\nallowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the\nreassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective\nincome tax rate in the period in which the\nreassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that\nits estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount\ncould be different from the amounts reflected in the\nFirm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the\nextent that the final outcome of these amounts is\ndifferent than the amounts recorded, such differences\nwill generally impact the Firm’s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination is\nmade.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of\ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred\ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and\nassumptions that could differ from the actual results\nreflected in income tax returns filed during the\nsubsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns\nare generally recorded in the period when the tax\nreturns are filed and the global tax implications are\nknown, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax\nrate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income\ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant\nestimates and judgments associated with establishing\nlitigation reserves.\n152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards\nBoard\n(“FASB”) Standards Adopted since\nJanuary\n1, 2021\nStandard                              Summary of guidance                   Effects on financial statements\nProvides optional expedients and\nexceptions to current accounting\nguidance when financial\ninstruments, hedge accounting\nrelationships, and other\ntransactions are amended due to\nreference rate reform.\nProvides an election to account\nfor certain contract amendments\nrelated to reference rate reform\nas modifications rather than          •Issued and effective March 12,\nextinguishments without the           2020.

(“JPMorgan Chase”\nor the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed by, or under the supervision of,\nthe Firm’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and\neffected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of\nJPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making\nthe assessment, management used the “Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan\nChase’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management’s assessment, the\nFirm determined that there were no material weaknesses\nin its internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their\nreport which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 21, 2023\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    155\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2022, including the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). We also have audited the\nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\nreferred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our\nopinion, the Firm maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Firm changed the manner in which it\naccounts for credit losses on certain financial\ninstruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in\nthe accompanying Management’s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary\nto permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew\nYork, NY 10017\n156    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component\nof Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios was $17.0 billion on total\nportfolio-based retained loans of $785.9 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 . The Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the\nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the\nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied\nare determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take\ninto consideration the Firm's economic outlook as\nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S. unemployment and\nU.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of\nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as\nthe Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining\nthe quantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the\nadjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls\nover model validation and generation of macroeconomic\nscenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i)\nevaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion\nof its assets and $453.7 billion of its liabilities at\nfair value on a recurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $13.6 billion of trading assets and $37.8\nbillion of liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, collectively financial instruments,\nwhich are classified as level 3 as they contain one or\nmore inputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation models and\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the\nlevel 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs\nused by management to estimate the fair value of\ncertain of these financial instruments include\nvolatility relating to interest rates, correlation\nrelating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and\nforeign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the inputs to\nestimate fair value, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\nin performing procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence obtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    157\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s determination of the fair value, including\ncontrols over models, inputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included, among others, the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an independent\nestimate of fair value for a sample of these financial\ninstruments and comparing management’s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair value.\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing\nthe completeness and

statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    163\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 – Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business\nsegments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.\nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by\nregulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not\nassets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it\nhas a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest\nentity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have\nsufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions\nrelating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a\ncontrolling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm\nhas a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests,\nor through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in\ncompanies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a\nmajority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting,\nor (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other\nassets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are\nstructured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the\ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm\nas the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote,\nor the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm\ndoes not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners\nor members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and\nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially\nsignificant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-\nheld and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These\ninvestments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage\nof equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded\nin other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the\naccounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that,\nby design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to\nmake significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation\nto absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most\ncommon type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company\nselling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal\ndocuments that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s\ninvestors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate\ninvestors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of\nthe assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is\nrequired to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both\n(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance;\nand (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the\nactivities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts\nand circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This\nassessment\n164    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and\nsecond, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the\nmost significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of\ncall options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-\nmakers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the\nobligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment\nrequires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered\npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE,\nincluding its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests\nheld across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the\nFirm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority\nvoting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE\nconsolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement\nwith a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the\nFirm’s VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and\nother debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7\nfor further information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from\ncertain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management\nadministration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are\nsatisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal\ntransactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair\nvalue are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of\nfair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates\nin the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\nrevenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from\nthese estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense\ndenominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to\ntranslating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S.\noperations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative\npayables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits\nsecurities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan\nagreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified\nconditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain\ntransactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned\nagreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions\ngoverned by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single\ncurrency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or\ndeliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting\nparty (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the\nmoney” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only\nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of\ndefault rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are\nterminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all\nsuch sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to\npay the netted termination amount.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    165\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of\ntransactions also often contain a collateral/margin\nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or\ntitle transfer of, securities or cash\ncollateral/margin to the party that has the right to\ndemand margin (the “demanding party”). The\ncollateral/margin agreement typically requires a party\nto transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party\nwith a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit\non a net basis across all transactions governed by the\nmaster netting agreement, less any threshold. The\ncollateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding\nparty, upon default by the counterparty, the right to\nset-off any amounts payable by the counterparty\nagainst any posted collateral or the cash equivalent\nof any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the\ndemanding party the right to liquidate\ncollateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an\namount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5\nfor further discussion of the Firm’s derivative\ninstruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion\nof the Firm’s securities financing agreements.\nStatements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s\nConsolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined\nas those amounts included in cash and due from banks\nand deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2023\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (“TDRs”) The adoption of this guidance\neliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements\nfor TDRs, including the requirement to measure the\nallowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”)\nmethodology, and allows the option of a non-DCF\nportfolio-based approach for modified loans to\ntroubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still\napplied for these modified loans, the discount rate\nmust be the post-modification effective interest rate,\ninstead of the pre-modification effective interest\nrate. The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF,\nportfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans\nto troubled borrowers for all portfolios except\nmodified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm\nelected to continue applying a DCF methodology. See\nNote 13 for a description of the portfolio-based\nallowance approach and the asset-specific allowance\napproach. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023\nunder the modified retrospective method which resulted\nin a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses\nof approximately $ 600million and an increase to\nretained earnings of approximately $ 450million,\nafter-tax predominantly driven by residential real\nestate and credit card.\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2020 Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) The adoption of\nthis guidance established a single allowance framework\nfor all financial assets measured at amortized cost\nand certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This\nframework requires that management’s estimate reflects\ncredit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected\nlife and considers expected future changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the\nCECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for\ncredit losses represented management’s estimate of\nprobable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained\nloan portfolios and certain lending-related\ncommitments.

These assets and liabilities are\npredominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and\nreported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded\nlending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at\nfair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for\nexample, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not\navailable, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant\ntransaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters,\nincluding yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices),\ncorrelations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial\ninstruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. The level of precision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value.\nThe use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm\ncould result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-\ntaking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s\nFinance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and\ndetermining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at\nfair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and\nrisk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted\nacross the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s\nController), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including\nTreasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking\nfunctions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available.\nWhere independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including\nclient unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of\nstructured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and\nloss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review\nfor more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the\nestimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments\nclassified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the\nfair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to\nappropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet\nspecified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a\nconsistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external\nprice or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity.\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in\ndetermining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument\nbeing traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of\nreasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial\ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair\nvalue of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction.\nWhere this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal\nmarket-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market\nparticipant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market\nmove that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-\nsize.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    167\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nUncertainty adjustments related to unobservable\nparameters may be made when positions are valued using\nprices or input parameters to valuation models that\nare unobservable due to a lack of market activity or\nbecause they cannot be implied from observable market\ndata. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and\nare, therefore, subject to management judgment.\nAdjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty\ninherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where\nappropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its\nestimates of fair value in order to appropriately\nreflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s\nown creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding\n(FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm.\nRefer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of\nthis Note for more information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval If prices or\nquotes are not available for an instrument or a\nsimilar instrument, fair value is generally determined\nusing valuation models that consider relevant\ntransaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs\nmarket-based or independently sourced parameters.\nWhere this is the case the price verification process\ndescribed above is applied to the inputs in those\nmodels. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new\nmodels, as well as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to implementation in the operating\nenvironment. In certain circumstances exceptions may\nbe granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be\nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to\nmitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the\ninterim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP\nfor disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair\nvalue hierarchy is based on the observability of\ninputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of\nthe measurement date. The three levels are defined as\nfollows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation\nmethodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for\nidentical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include\nquoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in\nactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for\nsubstantially the full term of the financial\ninstrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the\nvaluation methodology are unobservable and significant\nto the fair value measurement. A financial\ninstrument’s categorization within the fair value\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\n168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant\nproducts/instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument                    Valuation methodology                 Classifications in the fair value\nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements       Valuations are based on discounted    Predominantly level 2\ncash flows, which consider:\nDerivative features: refer to\nthe\ndiscussion of derivatives below\nfor\nfurther information\nMarket rates for the respective\nmaturity\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related\ncommitments — wholesale               Where observable market data is\nLoans carried at fair value           available, valuations are based       Level 2 or 3\n(trading loans and non-trading        on:\nloans) and associated\nlending-related commitments\nObserved market prices\n(circumstances\nare infrequent)\nRelevant broker quotes\nObserved market prices for\nsimilar\ninstruments\nWhere observable market data is\nunavailable or limited, valuations\nare\nbased on discounted cash flows,\nwhich\nconsider the following:\nCredit spreads derived from the\ncost\nof CDS;

term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge\naccounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities\ninventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    173\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and\nother funds, were $ 950million and $ 801million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, were trading assets of $ 43million and $ 51million, respectively, and other assets of $ 907million and $\n750million, respectively.\n(e) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $ 9.7billion and $ 26.2billion, respectively, of residential first-lien\nmortgages, and $ 6.8billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government\nagencies of $ 2.4billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n174    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair\nvalue is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to\nthe lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of\nsuch inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In\naddition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input\nvalues presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the\ndegree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of\nthe instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    175\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3\ninputs(…\nDecember\n31, 2022\nFair                 Principal    Unobserv…      Range

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a\nchange in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do\nexist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following\ndiscussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that\naffect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the\ninterest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield,\nin isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the\namount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for\ntaking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security\nprimarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the\ncoupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the\nrange of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit\nspreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a\ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par\nand an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the\nremaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being\npaid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The\nconditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between\nconditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has\nhigh prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in\nthe conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional\ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional\ndefault rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the\ninverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate\nliquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An\nincrease in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in\nvaluing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including\nthe LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    177\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation\ninputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one\nparameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or\na decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in\nisolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the\nvaluation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of\nthose risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between\ntwo interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as\nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a\nmeasure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the\nparticular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options,\nincluding equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in\nisolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the\nvaluation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from\nthat of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which\ncan be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional\nvalue that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can\nvary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price\nof the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement . Interest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The\ninterest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing\ninput used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price – Forward price is the price at which the\nbuyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is\nsuch that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of\ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the\nunderlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of\nholding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a\nfair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a\nrollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments\nclassified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on\nthe significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that\nis, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and\nlosses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the\nvaluation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy;

These\nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors\nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s\nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it\nis generally necessary to make adjustments to the base\nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA\nrepresents the adjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect\ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates\nCVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected\npositive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s\nexisting positions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of default\nand estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the\nprobability of a default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated\nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied\nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences\nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to\nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally\nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents\nthe adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is\nrecognized where there is evidence that a market\nparticipant in the principal market would incorporate\nit in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the\nexpected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s\npositions with\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at\nthe relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with the counterparty,\nand therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue\nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality\non the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality\nover time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                         2022       2021       2020\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA                    $    22    $   362    $  -337\nDerivatives FVA                         42         47        -64\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on\nfair value option elected liabilities reflects changes\n(subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the\nFirm’s probability of default and LGD, which are\nestimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread\nobserved in the bond market.

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect\nthe different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the\nFirm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments\nrecorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are\nincluded in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                   2022        2021\nOther assets\nCarrying value(a)                           $  4,096    $  3,642\nUpward carrying value changes(b)                 488         432\nDownward carrying value                         -826         -53\nchanges/impairment(c)\n(a) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward\ncarrying value changes.\n(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $ 1.4billion.\n(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $(\n918) million .\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) recorded at a\nnominal carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3million Visa B shares, resulting in a net\npretax gain of $ 914million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions\nand are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final\nresolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the\nFirm’s sale of 20million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of\nthe shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.\nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent\nchanges in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The\npayments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The\nderivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate\nof the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading\nliabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held\nderivative instruments associated with the 23million Visa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to\nsimilar terms and conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37million shares. On\nJanuary 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B\nshares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059to 1.5991effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be\nfurther adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those\nlitigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is\nunknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the\ntermination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a result of this, as well as\ndifferences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to\nbe held at their nominal carrying value.\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial\ninstruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as\nnonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion\nof management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not\ndisclosed in this table. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that\napproximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk.

In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated\nmaturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of\nthe inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDe…                                               D…\n31,                                               3…\n20…                                               2…\nEs…                                              Es…\nfa…                                              fa…\nva…                                              va…\nhi…                                              hi…\nTo…                                                         T…\n(…       Ca…       Le…       Le…       Le…       es…       C…       Le…             L…             Le…       e…\nb…       va…         1         2         3       fa…       v…         1              2               3       f…\nva…                                                         v…\nF…\na…\nC…\na…\nd…    $  27…    $  27…    $    —    $    —    $  27…    $  2…    $  26…          $   —          $    —    $  2…\nf…\nb…\nD…\nw…       53…       53…       0.2         —       53…       7…       71…    -b       0…    -b         —       7…\nb…\nA…\ni…\na…       12…         —       12…       0.1       12…       1…         —             1…             0.1       1…\na…\nr…\nF…\nf…\ns…\na…\ns…       3.7         —       3.7         —       3.7       9…         —             9…               —       9…\np…\nu…\nr…\na…\nS…       11…         —       11…         —       11…       1…         —             1…               —       1…\nb…\nI…\ns…       42…       18…       19…         —       38…       3…       18…             1…               —       3…\nh…\nL…\nn…\nof\na…       1,…         —       19…       85…       1,…       1…         —             2…             82…       1…\nf…\nl…\nl…\nO…       10…         —       99…       1.7       10…       9…         —             9…             1.4       9…\nF…\nl…\nD…    $  2,…    $    —    $  2,…    $    —    $  2,…    $  2…    $    —          $  2…          $    —    $  2…\nF…\nf…\np…\na…\ns…\nl…       50…         —       50…         —       50…       6…         —             6…               —       6…\nor\ns…\nu…\nr…\na…\nS…       28…         —       28…         —       28…       3…         —             3…               —       3…\nb…\nA…\np…\na…       25…         —       25…       5.6       25…       2…         —             2…             4.9       2…\no…\nl…\nB…\ni…\ni…       12…         —       12…         —       12…       1…         —             1…               —       1…\nby\nc…\nV…\nL…       22…         —       21…       2.8       21…       2…         —             2…             3.1       2…\nd…\n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,\nincluding expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary\nmarket spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\n(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at\nfair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between\nthe measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an\naccrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as\nwell as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair\nvalue includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing\nactivity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related\ncommitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets\nthat contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a\nderivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial\ninstruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities\nCertain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying\nassets are carried at fair value\n188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

Refer to Note 7 for further information\nregarding interest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk,\nwere determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are\nattributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value\nfor the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are\ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s\ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of\nagreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the\nprincipal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-\nspecific credit risk related to these agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    189\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for loans, long-term debt and long-term\nbeneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nDec…\n31,                                           Fair                                               Fair\n(in                                          value                                              value\nmil…        2022                             over…            2021                              over…\nLoa…       Cont…                             cont…           Cont…                              cont…\nNon…       prin…                  Fair       prin…           prin…                   Fair       prin…\nloa…       outs…                 value       outs…           outs…                  value       outs…\nLoa…\nrep…\nas      $  2,517              $    368    $  -2,1…        $  3,263              $     546    $  -2,7…\ntra…\nass…\nLoa…         967                   829        -138             918                    797        -121\nSub…       3,484                 1,197       -2,2…           4,181                  1,343       -2,8…\n90\nor\nmore\ndays\npast\ndue\nand\ngov…\ngua…\nLoa…         124                   115          -9             293                    281         -12\nAll\noth…\nper…\nloa…\nLoa…\nrep…\nas         7,823                 6,135       -1,6…           8,529        -e        7,528       -1,0…        -e\ntra…\nass…\nLoa…       42,5…                 41,1…       -1,4…           57,4…        -e       57,742         252        -e\nSub…       50,4…                 47,2…       -3,1…           66,0…                 65,270        -749\nTot…    $  54,0…              $  48,5…    $  -5,4…        $  70,4…              $  66,894    $  -3,5…\nloa…\nLon…\ndebt\nPri…    $  41,3…        -d    $  31,1…    $  -10,…        $  35,9…        -d    $  33,799    $  -2,1…\ndebt\nNon…              NA             41,1…              NA              NA             41,135              NA\ndeb…\nTot…\nlon…              NA          $  72,2…              NA              NA          $  74,934              NA\ndebt\nLon…\nben…\nint…\nNon…              NA          $      5              NA              NA          $      12              NA\ndeb…\nTot…\nlon…              NA          $      5              NA              NA          $      12              NA\nben…\nint…\n(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies.\n(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term\nbeneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the\nFirm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and\nlong-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for\nstructured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature\nembedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both\nnonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual\nprincipal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.\n(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value\noption was elected was $ 7.6billion and $ 11.9billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $ 24million\nand $ 10million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit\nrisk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are\nmanaged primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the\nportfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty\nbasis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,\nsecuritizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular\nloan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and\ncollateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for\nloan losses.\n192    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the\nFirm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Refer to Note 14 for more\ninformation on exposures to SPEs.\n(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and\nreadily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and\nmonitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and\naccounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\n(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 556.6billion and $ 729.6billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.\n(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative receivables.\n(i) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $ 350million and $ 5.4billion of loans in Business Banking under the\nPPP, respectively. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm\ntypically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these\nloans.\n(j) Represents lending-related financial instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    193\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 5 – Derivative instruments\nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a\ncombination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability\nwithout having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in\nderivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of\nthe Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to\nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or\nselling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk\nmanagement derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments,\nincluding derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the\nrisk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in\nmarket value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of\nvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses\non the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain\nforeign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or\nforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to\nmanage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are\nexpected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are\nused to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the\nCredit derivatives section on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to\nthe risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables\non pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and\nsettlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the\nderivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange\nand cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared\nderivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges\nand clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the\noffsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not\nthe transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as\nhedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this\nNote provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and\nlosses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n194    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management\nactivities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk\nof loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For\nthe same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity\nderivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be\ndesignated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must\nidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as\ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those\nterms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS\nsecurities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain\namounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life\nof the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings\nas a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of\nthe hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow\nhedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and\nliabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the\nfair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item –\nprimarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is\nterminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash\nflows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the\nvalue of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are\nnot the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to\nchanges in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the\nassessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    195\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table

Where such a legal opinion has not been\neither sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those\nderivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).\nThese amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not\neligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are\nshown separately as \" Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets \" in the tables below, up to the\nfair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent\nwith the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or

It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk\ninherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk,\nas the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as\nthe fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and\nits subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the\ncontract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-\ncleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings\ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2022\nand 2021.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables\ncontaining downgrade triggers\n(in millions)                                  December 31, 2022                 December 31, 2021\nAggregate fair value of net derivative                              $  16,023                         $  20,114\npayables\nCollateral posted                                                      15,505                            19,402\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrelated to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be\ntriggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating\nagency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major\nrating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing\ntransactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale\nand a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

Gains and losses\nwere recorded in principal transactions revenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management\ncategories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection\npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments\nunder the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its\nobligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has\nthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is\nboth a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit\nderivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the\nneeds of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives\ncounterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial\ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    205\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-\nname”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts.\nSingle-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are\nused to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P\n500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series\nof CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the\nreference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios\nof reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide\nprotection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such\nstructures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the\noccurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to\nthe reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the\nface value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit\nderivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt\ninstrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit\nevent occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where\nthe issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or\nan index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the\ntransaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the\nreferenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference\nentity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit\nevent occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the\ninvestor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation\nat the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference\nentity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related\nnotes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of\nprotection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the\namount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference\nobligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by\npurchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection\nreferenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference\npositions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB\nthrough credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit\nprotection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.\nSince these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table\nbelow.\n206    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such\nderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit\nevent, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of\nwhich reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\nTotal credit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-related\nnotes\nDecember 31,\n2022                         Maximum    Protection\n(in millions)        payout/Notional    purchased with                      Net protection                Other\nCredit                        amount    identical                          (sold)/purchas…           protection\nderivatives          Protection sold    underlyings(c)                                  d)         purchased(e)\nCredit default    $         -495,557                      $  509,846    $           14,289    $           2,917\nswaps\nOther credit                 -47,165                          65,029                17,864               11,746\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit                -542,722                         574,875                32,153               14,663\nderivatives\nCredit-related                     —                               —                     —                7,863\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $         -542,722                      $  574,875    $           32,153    $          22,526\nMaximum\npayout/Notional\namount\nProtection                                                        Other\nProtection sold    purchased with                      Net protection           protection\nidentical                          (sold)/purchas…         purchased(e)\nunderlyings(c)\nDecember 31,\n2021\n(in millions)\nCredit\nderivatives\nCredit default    $         -443,481                      $  458,180    $           14,699    $           2,269\nswaps\nOther credit                 -56,130                          79,586                23,456               13,435\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit                -499,611                         537,766                38,155               15,704\nderivatives\nCredit-related                     —                               —                     —                9,437\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $         -499,611                      $  537,766    $           38,155    $          25,141\n(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.\n(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is\nidentical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each\nindividual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection\nsold.\n(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would\ngenerally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement\nvalue.\n(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where\nthe Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of\ncredit derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.

The related contracts are\noften terminable on demand and the Firm has no\nremaining obligation to deliver future services. For\narrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue associated\nwith these remaining performance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future events or\nunderlying asset values, and is not recognized until\nthe outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue category includes\ndebt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via\npublic offering and private placement of various types\nof debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are recognized as\nrevenue typically upon execution of the client’s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan\narrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees,\nincluded within debt underwriting fees, are recorded\nas revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing\nand yield criteria.

In connection with its client-\ndriven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities, including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that reference\ncommodities. Principal transactions revenue also\nincludes realized and unrealized gains and losses\nrelated to: • derivatives designated in qualifying\nhedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value\nhedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign\nexchange and interest rate risks. Refer to Note 5 for\nfurther information on the income statement\nclassification of gains and losses from derivatives\nactivities. In the financial commodity markets, the\nFirm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps,\nforwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range\nof underlying commodities.

Certain\ncredit card products offer the cardholder the ability\nto earn points based on account activity, which the\ncardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash\nrewards. The cost to the Firm related to these\nproprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple\nfactors including the terms and conditions of the\nrewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder\nreward redemption rates and cardholder reward\nselections. The Firm maintains a liability for its\nobligations under its rewards programs and reports the\ncurrent-period cost as a reduction of card income.\nCredit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has\ncontractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners\nthat grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-\nbranded credit card products and market them to the\ncustomers of such partners. These partners endorse the\nco-brand credit card programs and provide their\ncustomer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may\nalso conduct marketing activities and provide rewards\nredeemable under their own loyalty programs that the\nFirm will grant to co-brand credit cardholders based\non account activity. The terms of these agreements\ngenerally range from fiveto ten years. The Firm\ntypically makes payments to the co-brand credit card\npartners based on the cost of partners’ marketing\nactivities and loyalty program rewards provided to\ncredit cardholders, new account originations and sales\nvolumes.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new\nparticipants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S.\nemployees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1,\n2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts\nbased on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that\nprovide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered\nunder these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements\nin certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the\n401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k)\nSavings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well\nas an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts\nrecorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB\nplans.\nDefined benefit\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,       pension and OPEB plans\n(in millions)                                                    2022          2021\nProjected benefit obligations               $                 -13,545    $  -18,046\nFair value of plan assets                                      19,890        25,692\nNet funded status                                               6,345         7,646\nAccumulated other comprehensive                                -1,916          -453\nincome/(loss)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was\n5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in\nOCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent\nperiods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected\nbenefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected\nremaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. During the year ended December 31,\n2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a\nresult of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S.\nprincipal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction\nin the plan’s projected benefit obligation totaling $ 4.0billion and $ 2.6billion, respectively, resulting in a net\ndecrease of $ 1.4billion in pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly\nattributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and the discount rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the\ndefined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nPension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)                           2022         2021        2020\nTotal net periodic defined benefit plan    $                    -192    $    -201    $   -285\ncost/(credit)(a)\nTotal defined contribution plans                               1,408        1,333       1,332\nTotal pension and OPEB cost included in    $                   1,216    $   1,132    $  1,047\nnoninterest expense\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive    $                   1,459    $  -1,129    $   -214\n(income)/loss\n(a) Includes pension settlement loss of $ 92million and $ 33million, respectively, for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021.\n212    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit\ncosts for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31,                                                   2022       2021       2020\nDiscount rate                                                             2.54  %    2.17  %    2.93  %\nExpected long-term rate of return on                                      3.68  %    2.97  %    3.91  %\nplan assets\nPlan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of\nreturn is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for the\nvarious asset classes, taking into consideration local\nmarket conditions and the specific allocation of plan\nassets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a\nforward-looking approach and are not strictly based on\nhistorical returns, with consideration given to\ncurrent market conditions and the portfolio mix of\neach plan. The discount rates used in determining the\nbenefit obligations are generally provided by the\nFirm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by\nreference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with\nmaturity dates and coupons that closely match each of\nthe plan’s projected cash flows.\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in\nvarious trusts and are invested in well-diversified\nportfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash\nand cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The\nFirm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset\nmanagers, as well as other factors that could impact\nthe portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed\nnecessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by\nasset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit\nplan are 42- 100% debt securities, 0- 40% equity\nsecurities, 0- 3% real estate, and 0- 12% alternatives\nas of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022,\nassets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans do not include securities issued by\nJPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through\nindirect exposures through investments in exchange\ntraded funds, mutual funds and collective investment\nfunds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans hold investments that are\nsponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase\nin the amount of $ 1.7billion and $ 2.5billion, as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFair value measurement of the plans’ assets and\nliabilities\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2,\nand 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation\nmethods employed by the Firm.\nPens…\nplan\nasse…\nand\nliab…       Defin…\nmeas…       benef…\nat          pensi…\nfair           and\nvalue         OPEB\nDece…        plans\n31,           2022                                  Total         2021                                    Total\n(in          Level        Level        Level         fair        Level         Level        Level          fair\nmill…         1(a)         2(b)         3(c)        value         1(a)          2(b)         3(c)         value\nAsse…\nmeas…\nat\nfair\nvalue    $   5,308    $   9,617    $   2,613    $  17,538    $   6,541    $   12,315    $   3,172    $   22,028\nclas…\nin\nfair\nvalue\nhier…\nAsse…\nmeas…\nat\nfair\nvalue\nusing\nNAV\nas                                                  2,593                                                 3,960\nprac…\nexpe…\nnot\nclas…\nin\nfair\nvalue\nhier…\nNet\ndefi…\nbene…\npens…\nplan\npaya…                                                -241                                                  -296\nnot\nclas…\nin\nfair\nvalue\nhier…\nTotal\nfair\nvalue                                           $  19,890                                            $   25,692\nof\nplan\nasse…\n(a) Consists predominantly of equity securities, U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government debt\nsecurities, and cash equivalents.\n(b) Consists predominantly of corporate debt securities and U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government\ndebt securities.\n(c) Consists of corporate-owned life insurance policies and participating annuity contracts.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    213\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nChanges in level 3 fair value measurements using\nsignificant unobservable inputs Investments classified\nin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy decreased in\n2022 to $ 2.6billion, due to $ 501million in\nunrealized losses and $ 54million in settlements, and\nincreased in 2021 to $ 3.2billion, predominantly due\nto $ 332million in unrealized gains, partially offset\nby $ 94million in settlements.\nEstimated future benefit payments The following table\npresents benefit payments expected to be paid for the\ndefined benefit pension and OPEB plans for the years\nindicated.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans\n2023                                                          1,022\n2024                                                          1,016\n2025                                                          1,007\n2026                                                            980\n2027                                                            977\nYears 2028–2032                                               4,720\n214    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 9 – Employee share-based incentives\nEmployee share-based awards In 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted long-term share-based awards to certain\nemployees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May\n18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69million shares of common stock were available for\nissuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based\nincentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of\nacquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based\nincentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted\nannually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common\nstock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow\nemployees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject\nto post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain\nclawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs\nentitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock\nduring the period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by\nthe Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation\nprogram. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The\nnumber of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue\nduring the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend\nequivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend\nequivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax\nwithholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of\napproximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI\nPlans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price\nequal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire\nten yearsafter the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating\nOfficer 1.5million and 750,000SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022 and grants\nin 2020 were not material. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net\nof estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche\ngranted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of\nthe respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period.\nFor awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service\nrequirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant\ndate without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to\nemployees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the\nvesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-\nbased incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares.

Debt securities\nclassified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2.\nPredominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities\nare held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its\nasset-liability management activities. AFS securities\nare carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any\napplicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance\nfor credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are included\nin investment securities gains/(losses) on the\nConsolidated statements of income. HTM securities,\nwhich the Firm has the intent and ability to hold\nuntil maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of\nallowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities,\npurchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized\ninto interest income on a level-yield basis over the\ncontractual life of the security. However, premiums on\ncertain callable debt securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date. During 2022 and 2021, the Firm\ntransferred $ 78.3billion and $ 104.5billion of\ninvestment securities, respectively, from AFS to HTM\nfor capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax\nunrealized gains/(losses) of $( 4.8) billion and $\n425million, respectively, on the securities at the\ndates of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the\ndate of transfer of these securities continue to be\nreported in AOCI and are amortized into interest\nincome on a level-yield basis over the remaining life\nof the securities. This amortization will offset the\neffect on interest income of the amortization of the\npremium or discount resulting from the transfer\nrecorded at fair value. Transfers of securities from\nAFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded\nat fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    217\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates\nindicated.\nDece…\n31,\n(in\nmill…\nAvai…\nsecu…         2022        Gross        Gross                       2021        Gross         Gross\nMort…       Amort…       unrea…       unrea…         Fair       Amorti…       unrea…       unreal…         Fair\nsecu…       cost(…        gains       losses        value       cost(b…        gains        losses        value\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand      $  77,194    $     479    $   6,170    $  71,503    $   72,800    $     736    $      993    $  72,543\ngove…\nagen…\nResi…\nU.S.         1,576            1          111        1,466         2,128           38             2        2,164\nNon-…        3,176            5           27        3,154         3,882           25             1        3,906\nComm…        2,113            —          155        1,958         4,944           22            17        4,949\nTotal\nmort…       84,059          485        6,463       78,081        83,754          821         1,013       83,562\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         95,217          302        3,459       92,060       178,038          668         1,243       177,4…\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.         7,103           86          403        6,786        14,890          972             2       15,860\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nNon-…\ngove…       20,360           14          678       19,696        16,163           92            46       16,209\ndebt\nsecu…\nCorp…\ndebt           381            —           24          357           332            8            19          321\nsecu…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan         5,916            1          125        5,792         9,674            6            18        9,662\nobli…\nOther        3,152            2           69        3,085         5,403           47             2        5,448\nTotal\navai…       216,1…          890       11,221       205,8…       308,254        2,614         2,343       308,5…\nsecu…\nHeld…\nsecu…\nMort…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand         113,4…           35       13,709       99,818       102,556        1,400           853       103,1…\ngove…\nagen…\nU.S.        10,503            3        1,244        9,262         7,316            1           106        7,211\nResi…\nComm…       10,361           10          734        9,637         3,730           11            54        3,687\nTotal\nmort…       134,3…           48       15,687       118,7…       113,602        1,412         1,013       114,0…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         207,4…            —       18,363       189,1…       185,204          169         2,103       183,2…\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.        19,747           53        1,080       18,720        13,985          453            44       14,394\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan        61,414            4        1,522       59,896        48,869           75            22       48,922\nobli…\nOther        2,325            —          110        2,215         2,047            1             7        2,041\nTotal\nheld…       425,3…          105       36,762       388,6…       363,707        2,110         3,189       362,6…\nsecu…\nTotal\ninve…\nsecu…\nnet\nof       $  641,4…    $     995    $  47,983    $  594,5…    $  671,961    $   4,724    $    5,532    $  671,1…\nallo…\nfor\ncred…\nloss…\n(a) The Firm purchased $ 33.7billion, $ 111.8billion and $ 12.4billion of HTM securities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 96million and $\n42million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(c) Excludes $ 2.5billion and $ 1.9billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent with its\npolicy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse\nthrough interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit\nrating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the\nportfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and\nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default\n(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at\nacquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the\nlife of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n218    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm\nhas the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment\nloss is recognized in investment securities\ngains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and is equal to the full difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and\nthe fair value of the security. For impaired debt\nsecurities that the Firm has the intent and ability to\nhold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a\ncredit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit\nloss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance\nfor credit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on\ndebt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded\nin OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses\ninclude adverse conditions specifically related to the\nindustry, geographic area or financial condition of\nthe issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and\npayment structure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess spread,\novercollateralization or other forms of credit\nenhancement, and compares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the\nlevel of credit enhancement in the securitization\nstructure to determine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a\ncredit loss exists. For beneficial interests in\nsecuritizations that are rated below “AA” at their\nacquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or\notherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would\nnot recover substantially all of its recorded\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit\nlosses when there is an adverse change in expected\ncash flows.\nHTM securities – credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses represents\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of HTM securities. The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated by applying statistical\ncredit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived\nusing a weighted average of five internally developed\neight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation to revert to\nlong run historical information for periods beyond the\nforecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further\ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential\nmortgage-backed securities is calculated as the\ndifference between the amortized cost and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected,\ndiscounted at the security’s effective interest rate.\nThese cash flow estimates are developed based on\nexpectations of underlying collateral performance\nderived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast\nand the single year straight-line interpolation, as\nwell as considering the structural features of the\nsecurity. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance for\ncredit losses is subject to significant management\njudgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over\nanother, or considering other inputs or assumptions,\ncould affect the estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM securities. Credit quality indicator The\nprimary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is\nthe risk rating assigned to each security. At both\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were\nrated investment grade and were current and accruing,\nwith approximately 98% rated at least AA+. Allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities The\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities\nwas $ 96million, $ 42million and $ 78million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are\nused where applicable.

However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six yearsfor both agency residential\ncollateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    221\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,\n“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover\nshort sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s\nexcess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the\nsame counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets\nand liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the\nlife of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm\nhas elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option\nhas been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,\nwith changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for\nhybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)\nthat it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged\ncollateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin\nlevels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the\npermissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash\nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to\nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It\nis also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in\nsecurities financing agreements.\n222    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the\neconomic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet\npresentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master\nnetting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or\nobtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where\nthe Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can\nbe pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and\nthe obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nDecember 31,\n2022\nAmounts             Amounts        Amounts not\nnetted on the        presented on        nettable on\n(in                Gross amounts        Consolidated                 the                the                 Net\nmillions)                                    balance        Consolidated       Consolidated          amounts(c)\nsheets             balance            balance\nsheets          sheets(b)\nAssets\nSecurities\npurchased       $        597,912    $       -282,411    $        315,501    $      -304,120    $         11,381\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               228,279             -42,910             185,369           -131,578              53,791\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        480,793    $       -282,411    $        198,382    $      -167,427    $         30,955\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                52,443             -42,910               9,533             -9,527                   6\nother(a)\nDecember 31,\n2021\nAmounts             Amounts        Amounts not\nnetted on the        presented on        nettable on\n(in                Gross amounts        Consolidated                 the                the                 Net\nmillions)                                    balance        Consolidated       Consolidated          amounts(c)\nsheets             balance            balance\nsheets          sheets(b)\nAssets\nSecurities\npurchased       $        604,724    $       -343,093    $        261,631    $      -245,588    $         16,043\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               250,333             -44,262             206,071           -154,599              51,472\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        532,899    $       -343,093    $        189,806    $      -166,456    $         23,350\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                52,610             -44,262               8,348             -8,133                 215\nother(a)\n(a) Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $ 7.0billion and $ 5.6billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.\n(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that\ncounterparty.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The\ntransferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded\npredominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n224    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 12 – Loans\nLoan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n“retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of\nthe Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment,\nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign\nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on\nperforming loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued\ninterest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then\nrecognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit\nlosses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not\nrecognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them\noff no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on\nwhich the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment\nof principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has\nbeen in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment\nis due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual\nstatus. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed\nagainst interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on\nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded\nloan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the\nrecorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest\nincome on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the\nterms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from\nbeing placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue\nuntil the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents\nthe estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated\nstatements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance\nfor loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized\ncost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with\nan offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with\nstandards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business\nbanking loans are generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans\nare charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net\nrealizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances: • Loans modified in a\nTDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that\nsuggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    225\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a\nbankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances,\nthe Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans\nare charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize\na charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of\nthe workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is\ncharged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral,\nthe determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real\nestate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral\nis generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are\nbased upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay,\nthe Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an\nexterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12months, or more frequently\ndepending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of\na debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an\ninspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior\nappraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the\nestimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For\ncommercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external\nvaluation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new\nappraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers\nboth borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price\nopinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or\nfair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed\non a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income\non loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees\nor costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is\nsold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore\nare included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss\nrecognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are\nsubject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has\nbeen elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest\nincome on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value\nare recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan\norigination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized\nat fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However,\nloans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information\non the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for\nfurther information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-\nrelated losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to\nchanges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event\nthat management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to\nmodify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the\nFirm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments\nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness,\nor the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported\nas TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in\nmany cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to\nperforming status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has\nperformed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an\nexpectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt\ncapacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In\ncertain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans\nare not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for\nimpairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-\ndefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been\nreturned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s\nasset-specific allowance. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan\nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real\nestate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and\nships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking\nlegal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the\nasset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the\nborrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially\nrecognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is\nreviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are\ncharged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged\nto other expense.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    227\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to\ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

Loans that are more than 30days past\ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable\nor unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely\nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater\nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar\nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary\nbased on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or\nthe combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the\nevent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit\npayment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher\nrisk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a\nlow FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit\nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights\ninto the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\n230    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n…\n…       D…\n…       3…\n…       2…\n…\n…                                                                  R…\n…                                                                  l…                           To…\n…\n…\nP…                 W…       Co…\n…       2…        2…        2…        2…        to                 t…        to\n2…                 r…       te…\np…       lo…\n…\n…\n…    $  3…     $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  6…     $  4…             $  5,…     $  9…              $  2…\n…\n…       29        11        14        20        20        5…                 15        2…                 9…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…        1         1         6        10         7        4…                  4        1…                 6…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  3…     $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  6…     $  5…             $  5,…     $  1…              $  2…\n…\n%\n…\n…\n…\n…       0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     2…  %             0.…  %     3…  %              0…  %\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…       D…\n…       3…\n…       2…\n…\n…                                                                  R…\n…                                                                  l…                           To…\n…\n…\nP…                 W…       Co…\n…       2…        2…        2…        2…        to                 t…        to\n2…                 r…       te…\np…       lo…\n…\n…\n…    $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  7…     $  1…     $  4…             $  6,…     $  1…              $  2…\n…\n…       13        23        27        27        22        5…                 11        1…                 8…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…        —        11        21        25        33        1…                  6        2…                 1…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  7…     $  1…     $  5…             $  6,…     $  1…              $  2…\n…\n%\n…\n…\n…\n…       0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     3…  %             0.…  %     3…  %              1…  %\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were\nnot material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(b) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are\ngenerally not considered delinquent.\n(c) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not\nmaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Delinquency\nrates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that\nborrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been\ndelinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the\ngeographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does\nnot view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a\nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the\nportfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random\nsample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry\nbenchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers.\nHowever, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder\nand changes in the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\ncredit card loans.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)                                         2022\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans(a)        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                     181,793     $    696     $  182,489\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                              1,356           64          1,420\n90 or more days past due and still                                  1,230           36          1,266\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                     184,379     $    796     $  185,175\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                             1.40  %     12.56  %        1.45  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                             0.67         4.52           0.68\nloans\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)                                         2021\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans(a)        Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                     151,798     $    901     $  152,699\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                                770           59            829\n90 or more days past due and still                                    741           27            768\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                     153,309     $    987     $  154,296\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                             0.99  %      8.71  %        1.04  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                             0.48         2.74           0.50\nloans\n(a) Represents TDRs.\n236    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)                           December 31, 2022              December 31, 2021\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia                                 $   28,154                     $   23,030\nTexas                                          19,171                         15,879\nNew York                                       15,046                         12,652\nFlorida                                        12,905                         10,412\nIllinois                                       10,089                          8,530\nNew Jersey                                      7,643                          6,367\nOhio                                            5,792                          4,923\nPennsylvania                                    5,517                          4,708\nColorado                                        5,493                          4,573\nArizona                                         4,487                          3,668\nAll other                                      70,878                         59,554\nTotal retained loans                       $  185,175                     $  154,296\nPercentage of portfolio based on\ncarrying value with estimated refreshed\nFICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660                     86.8  %                        88.5  %\nLess than 660                                    13.0                           11.3\nNo FICO available                                 0.2                            0.2\n(a) The geographic regions presented in the table are\nordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2022.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer loan modification programs granting\nconcessions to credit card borrowers who are\nexperiencing financial difficulty.

These modifications involve\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically include reducing\nthe interest rate on the credit card. Substantially\nall modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs\nare considered to be TDRs.

Defaulted\nmodified credit card loans remain in the modification\nprogram and continue to be charged off in accordance\nwith the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    237\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nWholesale loan portfolio\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients\nto high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating\nassigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within\nthe portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will\ndefault. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several\nfactors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s\ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however\nthe quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3\nor higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the\ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s\ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist\nof special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis\nby Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to\nfulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor\nconducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the\nmanagement and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries\nwith an actual or potential credit concern.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not\nconsidered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance\nunder the option provided by the CARES Act. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $\n801million, $ 881million and $ 734million, respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021\nand 2020 reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of\nthe loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other\nloan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $ 936million and $ 607million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    241\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance\nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,\nwhich is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about\nthe effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures,\nconsidering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance\nfor loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer\nto Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments The allowance for loan\nlosses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not\nrecord an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit\ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for\nloan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its\npolicy to write t hese receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected\nlife of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation\nfeatures, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally\nestimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those\namounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other\naccount activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements\nof the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest\ninterest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\nCollective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk\ncharacteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with\na particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The\nassessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic\nover another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics\nfor the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution,\nand, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit\nenhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share\nrisk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment\n(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and\ncertain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the\nFirm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and\nconditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers\nmodified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as\nwell as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based\ncomponent begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency\nstatus or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over\nan instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at\ndefault. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the\nevent of default. They are derived using\n242    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\na weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods\nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse,\nextreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting\nteam. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject\nmatter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from\nsenior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to\ntake into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are\nnot yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in\nmaking this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political\nconditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an\nindustry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit\nquality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by\nmanagement to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine\nthe asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which\nforeclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally\nevaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using\nfactors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as\nthe difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are\ngenerally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair\nvalue of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value\n(to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that\nshould be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of\ncollateral). The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified\nin TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest,\nprincipal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real\nestate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of\ndefault estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities\nof default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans\nand certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also\nconsiders its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card\nloans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and\ncharge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified\nor expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability\nto repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as\nthese cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including\nredefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any\nexpected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These\nestimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry,\nportfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain\ncircumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management\njudgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    243\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of loans\nand lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

Deterioration in the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now\nreflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning\nin the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and\ngeopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a\nweighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real\nGDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2022\n2Q23       4Q23       2Q24\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       —  %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22       4Q22       2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated\nas the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from\nthe prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial\ninstruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business               Transaction Type                 Activity                        2022 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB                            Credit card securitization       Securitization of originated    pages 247-248\ntrusts                           credit card receivables\nServicing and securitization\nMortgage securitization        of both originated and           pages 248-250\ntrusts                         purchased residential\nmortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other               originated and purchased\nCIB                            securitization trusts            residential and commercial      pages 248-250\nmortgages, and other\nconsumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits          markets in a cost-efficient      page 250\nmanner and structuring\ntransactions to meet investor\nneeds\nMunicipal bond vehicles        Financing of municipal bond      pages 250-251\ninvestments\nThe Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a\nlesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is\ncompetitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to\nbe significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCommercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including\ncertain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of\nthese entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the\nentity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in\nthe same manner as any other third-party transaction.\nCorporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are\ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of\ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties\nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not\nhave the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these\nentities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nRefer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the\nVIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily\nthrough the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain\nsenior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and\nliabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these\nsecuritization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing\nresponsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those\ntrusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other\ncontinuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm\nthe right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying\nsecuritized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of\nthe beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other\nobligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts\nrequire the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $\n6.1billion and $ 7.1billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    247\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nreceivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in\ncertain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm’s undivided interests\nin the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and\nother securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential\nmortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the\nparticular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans\nand/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2022           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    55,362    $       754    $    37,058    $       744    $     1,918    $         —    $    2,662\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…          9,709              —          1,743             10              —              —            10\nCommer…\nand            164,915              —        127,037            888          5,373            670         6,931\nother(…\nTotal      $   229,986    $       754    $   165,838    $     1,642    $     7,291    $       670    $    9,603\nJPMorg…\nChase\nintere…\nPrinci…                      Assets                  in\namount                     held in             securi…\noutsta…                     noncon…              assets\nDecem…         Total        Assets       securi…                  in                                      Total\n31,           assets       held in          VIEs             noncon…                                    intere…\n2021         held by       consol…          with             VIEs(c…                        Other       held by\n(in          securi…       securi…       contin…             Trading       Invest…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmilli…          VIEs          VIEs       involv…              assets       securi…         assets         Chase\nSecur…\nResid…\nmortg…\nPrime…\nand       $   55,085    $      942    $   42,522    -f    $      974    $      684    $        95    $    1,753\noption\nARMs\nSubpr…        10,966            27        10,115                   2             —              —             2\nComme…\nand          150,694             —        93,698                 671         3,274            506         4,451\nother…\nTotal     $  216,745    $      969    $  146,335          $    1,647    $    3,958    $       601    $    6,206\n(a) Excludes U.S. GSEs and government agency securitizations and re-securitizations, which are not Firm-sponsored.\n(b) Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables.\n(c) Excludes the following: retained servicing; securities retained from loan sales and securitization activity\nrelated to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to\nmanage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities; senior securities of $ 134million and $\n145million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,respectively, and subordinated securities which were not material at both\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.\n(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e) As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 84% and 79%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests,\nwhich are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 2.6billion and $ 1.6billion of investment-grade retained interests at December\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 131million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021;\nnoninvestment-grade retained interests were notmaterial at December 31, 2022. The retained interests in commercial\nand other securitization trusts consisted of $ 5.8billion and $ 3.5billion of investment-grade retained interests,\nand $ 1.1billion and $ 929million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n(f) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential\nmortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased from third\nparties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains\nservicing for all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for certain mortgage\nloans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is\nresponsible for decisions related to loan\nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization\ntrusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior\nand/or subordinated interests (including residual\ninterests and amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization, and/or\nreacquires positions in the secondary market in the\nnormal course of business. In certain instances, as a\nresult of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered\ntogether with the servicing arrangements entered into\nby CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm\ndoes not consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-\nsponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore\ndoes not have the power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and\nother consumer securitizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in\nunderwriting and trading activities involving the\nsecurities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may\nretain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests\n(including amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization but,\ngenerally, the Firm does not service commercial loan\nsecuritizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest\nin these securitizations as well. For commercial\nmortgage securitizations the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE generally is held by\nthe servicer or investors in a specified class of\nsecurities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally\ndoes not retain an interest in the controlling class\nin its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization\ntransactions. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in\ncertain re-securitization transactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential\nmortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is\nlargely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in\nthe re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                             2022         2021         2020\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  16,128    $  53,923    $  46,123\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort\nand decisions in establishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the significant\neconomic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did\nnot transfer any private label securities to re-\nsecuritization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and\nretained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial\ninterests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations\nand generally purchases these interests in the\nsecondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm\ndoes not have the unilateral ability to direct the\nmost significant activities of the re-securitization\ntrust, either because it was not involved in the\ninitial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved\nwith an independent third-party sponsor and\ndemonstrated shared power over the creation of the\ntrust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the\nre-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    249\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31,                                   Nonconsolidated\n(in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2022        2021\nInterest in VIEs                     $                   2,580    $  1,947\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm did not\nconsolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy\nremote entities that provide secured financing,\ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other\nfinancial assets, to customers of the Firm. The\nconduits fund their financing facilities through the\nissuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary\nsource of repayment of the commercial paper is the\ncash flows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-\nspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits\nby the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third\nparties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are\ngenerally structured to cover a multiple of historical\nlosses expected on the pool of assets, and are\ntypically in the form of overcollateralization\nprovided by the seller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on\nits agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely\nrepayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the\nconduits with funding to provide financing to\ncustomers in the event that the conduits do not obtain\nfunding in the commercial paper market, each asset\npool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated with it\nprovided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity\nfacilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the\nform of standby letters of credit. The amount of\nprogram-wide credit enhancement required is based upon\ncommercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm\nconsolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the conduits and a\npotentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in\nstructuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions\nregarding asset types and credit quality, and manages\nthe commercial paper funding needs of the conduits.\nThe Firm’s interests that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as\nadministrative agent and liquidity and program-wide\ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential\nexposure created by the liquidity and credit\nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes\nmarkets in and invests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm\nheld $ 13.8billion and $ 13.7billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nwhich have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs\nand capacity and were not driven by market\nilliquidity. Other than the amounts required to be\nheld pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm\nis not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity\nfacilities, program-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated\nin consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 10.6billion and $ 13.4billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are\nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to extend\ncredit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option\nbond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance\ntheir municipal bond investments at short-term rates.\nIn a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases\nhighly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and\nfunds the purchase by issuing two types of securities:\n(1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”)\nand (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests\n(“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by\nmoney market funds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB\ntrust. The residuals are retained by the investor\nseeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB\ntransactions where the residual is held by a third-\nparty investor are typically known as customer TOB\ntrusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions\nwhere the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer\nTOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm\nserves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide various services to\na TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is\nresponsible for establishing the periodic variable\nrate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement\nand remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing\nagent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in\nfloaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material\nduring 2022 and 2021. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole\nliquidity or tender option provider for the TOB\ntrusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform\nis conditional and is limited by certain events\n250    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal\nbond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the\nhigh credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain\ntransactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender,\ntheir floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another\ninvestor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the\nfloaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest\nentities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to\nmake decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the\nright to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLiabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,                                                                        intere…\n2022          Assets                                                            in\n(in          Trading                                           Total           VIE                        Total\nmilli…        assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…       assets…       Other(f)       liabil…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $   9,699          $      100    $     9,799    $    1,999    $         2    $    2,001\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             —       22,819                 170         22,989         9,236             39         9,275\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,089            —                   7          2,096         1,232             10         1,242\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          781                  10            791           143             67           210\nentit…\nOther             62        1,112    -b           263          1,437             —            161           161\nTotal     $    2,151    $  34,411          $      550    $    37,112    $   12,610    $       279    $   12,889\nAssets                                                       Liabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,          Trading                                           Total       intere…                        Total\n2021          assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…            in       Other(f)       liabil…\n(in                                                                            VIE\nmilli…                                                                     assets…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $  11,108          $      102    $    11,210    $    2,397    $         1    $    2,398\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             1       19,883                  71         19,955         6,198             41         6,239\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,009            —                   2          2,011         1,976              —         1,976\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          955                  32            987           179             85           264\nentit…\nOther              —        1,078    -b           283          1,361             —            118           118\nTotal     $    2,010    $  33,024          $      490    $    35,524    $   10,750    $       245    $   10,995\n(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities.

The holders of\nthese beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.1billion and $ 2.6billion at December\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    251\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,\nrepresented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 30.2billion and $ 26.8billion, of which $\n10.6billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each\nproject and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project\nqualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28\nfor more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB\ntrusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the\nFirm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to\nprotect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not\nconsolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact\nthe economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to\ncustomer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 5.8billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively. The fair value\nof assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 8.2billion and $ 10.5billion respectively. Loan\nsecuritizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card\nreceivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were\nto satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is\nnot required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale\nwhen all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally\nisolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the\ntransferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial\nassets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the\nability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for\nas a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received\n(including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold.\nGains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n252    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,                   2022       Commercial             2021       Commercial             2020       Commercial\n(in             Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and\nmillions)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)\nPrincipal    $      10,218    $       9,036    $      23,876    $      14,917    $       7,103    $       6,624\nsecuriti…\nAll cash\nflows\nduring\nthe\nperiod:(…\nProceeds\nreceived\nfrom loan    $       9,783    $       8,921    $      24,450    $      15,044    $       7,321    $       6,865\nsales as\nfinancial\ninstrume…\nServicing\nfees                    62                2              153                1              211                1\ncollected\nCash\nflows\nreceived               489              285              578              273              801              239\non\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser.

The\ngoodwill impairment test is generally performed by\ncomparing the current fair value of each reporting\nunit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in\nexcess of the carrying value, then the reporting\nunit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If\nthe fair value is less than the carrying value, then\nan impairment charge is recognized\nfor the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying\nvalue exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of\ngoodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Firm\nuses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus\ngoodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for\nthe carrying values of equity for the reporting units\nin the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit\nequity is determined on a similar basis as the\nallocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into\nconsideration a variety of factors including capital\nlevels of similarly rated peers and applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital\nlevels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget\nprocess, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital\nis further reviewed at least annually and updated as\nneeded. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate\nthe fair value of its reporting units is the income\napproach. This approach projects cash flows for the\nforecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method\nto calculate terminal values. These cash flows and\nterminal values, which are based on the reporting\nunits’ annual budgets and forecasts are then\ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate. The\ndiscount rate used for each reporting unit represents\nan estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting\nunit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall\nestimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital\nAsset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk\ncharacteristics specific to each reporting unit (for\nexample, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty\nassociated with the business or management’s forecasts\nand assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the\ndiscount rates used for each reporting unit,\nmanagement compares the discount rate to the estimated\ncost of equity for publicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk characteristics. In\naddition, the weighted average cost of equity\n(aggregating the various reporting units) is compared\nwith the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to\nensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis are then compared with\nmarket-based trading and transaction multiples for\nrelevant competitors. Trading and transaction\ncomparables are used as general indicators to assess\nthe overall reasonableness of the estimated fair\nvalues, although precise conclusions generally cannot\nbe drawn due to the differences that naturally exist\nbetween the Firm’s businesses and competitor\ninstitutions. The Firm also takes into consideration a\ncomparison between the aggregate fair values of the\nFirm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market\ncapitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the\nFirm considers several factors, including (i) a\ncontrol premium that would exist in a market\ntransaction, (ii) factors related to the level of\nexecution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level\nthat do not exist at the reporting unit level and\n(iii) short-term market volatility and other factors\nthat do not directly affect the value of individual\nreporting units.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    255\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as\nwell as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in\nthe estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline\nin the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash\nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and\nancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net\nservicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage\nloans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair\nvalue. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs\nused to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management\npurposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects\nMSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then\ndiscounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other\nancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable\nmarket data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\n256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs\ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase\nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.\nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is\nto offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related\nrisk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)                                                2022              2021               2020\nFair value at beginning of period           $  5,494          $  3,276          $   4,699\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                             798             1,659                944\nPurchase of MSRs                               1,400             1,363                248\nDisposition of MSRs(a)                          -822              -114               -176\nNet additions/(dispositions)                   1,376             2,908              1,016\nChanges due to collection/realization of        -936              -788               -899\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and       2,022               404             -1,568\nother(b)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to               14               109                -54\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                     —                 —                199\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)              3              -415               -117\nTotal changes in valuation due to other           17              -306                 28\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs       2,039                98             -1,540\nand assumptions\nFair value at December 31,                  $  7,973          $  5,494          $   3,276\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $  2,039          $     98          $  -1,540\nat December 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and        1,535             1,298              1,325\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at           584               520                448\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at December           0.8               1.6                1.8\n31, (in billions)(d)\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities\n(“SMBS”) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual\nmaturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is\nreasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are\nreported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements\nimpose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or\nenter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental\npayments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to\nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease\npayments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are\nrecognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the\nlease term.

In the second half of 2022, as a result\nof the expected increases in regulatory capital\nrequirements, the Firm temporarily suspended share\nrepurchases.

Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions\nprovided under the regulatory capital framework.\n(b) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm\ntemporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock.\nSubsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large\nbanks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share\nrepurchases through the end of 2020. The Board of\nDirectors’ authorization to repurchase common shares\nis utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing\nof purchases and the exact amount of common shares\nthat may be repurchased is subject to various factors,\nincluding market conditions; legal and regulatory\nconsiderations affecting the amount and timing of\nrepurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position\n(taking into account goodwill and intangibles);\ninternal capital generation; and alternative\ninvestment opportunities. The $ 30billion common share\nrepurchase program approved by the Board does not\nestablish specific price targets or timetables. The\nrepurchase program may be suspended by management at\nany time; and may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated transactions, or\nutilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading\nplans that the Firm may enter into from time to time\nunder Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common\nshares during periods when it may otherwise not be\nrepurchasing common shares — for example, during\ninternal trading blackout periods.

Under the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated\nto common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan\nChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation\nprograms, predominantly all of which entitle\nrecipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends\npaid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These\nunvested RSUs meet the definition of participating\nsecurities based on their respective rights to receive\nnonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a\nseparate class of securities in computing basic EPS.\nParticipating securities are not included as\nincremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to\nNote 9 for additional information.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of\ncontingently issuable shares, including awards which\nrequire future service as a condition of delivery of\nthe underlying common stock.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability method to provide\nfor income taxes on all transactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future\ntax consequences of temporary differences between the\ncarrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and\ntax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or\nliability for each temporary difference is determined\nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in\neffect when the underlying items of income and expense\nare realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred portions of\nthat expense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities\narising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being taxed in a\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions, significant\njudgments and estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase\nand the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files\ntax returns may not be finalized for several years.\nThus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and\nliabilities may ultimately be different from those\ncurrently reported.\nEffective tax rate and expense\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the\napplicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to\nthe effective tax rate.\nEffective tax rate\nYear ended December 31,                   2022       2021       2020\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate           21.0  %    21.0  %    21.0  %\nIncrease/(decrease) in tax rate\nresulting from:\nU.S. state and local income taxes, net     3.5        3.0        2.5\nof U.S. federal income tax benefit\nTax-exempt income                         -0.9       -0.9       -1.6\nNon-U.S. earnings                          0.4        0.1        1.4\nBusiness tax credits                      -5.4       -4.2       -5.4\nOther, net                                -0.2       -0.1        0.8\nEffective tax rate                        18.4  %    18.9  %    18.7  %\nThe following table reflects the components of income\ntax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated\nstatements of income.\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                 2022         2021         2020\nCurrent income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal                             $   5,606    $   2,865    $   5,759\nNon-U.S.                                     2,992        2,718        2,705\nU.S. state and local                         2,630        1,897        1,793\nTotal current income tax                    11,228        7,480       10,257\nexpense/(benefit)\nDeferred income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal                                -2,004        3,460       -2,776\nNon-U.S.                                      -154         -101         -126\nU.S. state and local                          -580          389         -671\nTotal deferred income                       -2,738        3,748       -3,573\ntaxexpense/(benefit)\nTotal income tax expense                 $   8,490    $  11,228    $   6,684\nTotal income tax expense includes $ 331million of tax\nbenefits in 2022, $ 69million of tax expenses in 2021,\nand $ 72million of tax benefits in 2020, resulting\nfrom the resolution of tax audits.\nTax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity\nThe preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of\ncertain items that are recorded each period directly\nin stockholders’ equity.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits are certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These unrecognized\nitems include the tax effect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state and local\nunrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the\nbenefit from associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.\nunrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in\nother jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need\nfor changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its\nanticipated tax return filing positions as part of its\nU.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In\naddition, the Firm is presently under audit by a\nnumber of taxing authorities, most notably by the\nInternal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax\nexamination status table below. The evaluation of\nunrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for\naudit settlements make it reasonably possible that\nover the next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by\nas much as approximately $ 1.0billion.

These\nrestrictions are imposed by various regulatory\nauthorities based on the particular activities of the\nFirm’s subsidiaries.\nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject\nto examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is\na member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its\ndeposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject\nto applicable limits.\nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at\ncertain non-US central banks.\nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations\nestablished by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As\npart of its compliance with the respective regulatory\nrequirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are\nsubject to certain restrictions on cash and other\nassets.\nThe following table presents the components of the\nFirm’s restricted cash:\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nSegregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers         18.7           14.6\nCash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes        8.1  2022      5.1  2021\nTotal restricted cash(a)                                                       $  26.8        $  19.7\n(a) Comprises $ 25.4billion and $ 18.4billion in\ndeposits with banks, and $ 1.4billion and $ 1.3billion\nin cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:\nCash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $ 42.4billion and $\n47.5billion, respectively.\nSecurities with a fair value of $ 31.7billion and $ 30.0billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation\nto customer activity.\nIntercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its\nsubsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the\nloans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company\nor to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred\nto as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are\ngenerally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital\nguidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates\nis limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC\ngenerally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent\nCompany is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal\nsources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and\nextensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit\nor to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and\nits subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking\norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain\ncapital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s\nmanagement or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2023, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the\naggregate, approximately $ 34billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior\napproval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the\nbanking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    273\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 27 – Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized requirements, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes\nsimilar minimum capital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel III establish\nminimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy\nstandards for large and internationally active U.S.\nbank holding companies and banks, including the Firm\nand its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel\nIII Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel\nIII Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital\nratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The\nthree components of regulatory capital under the Basel\nIII rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-\nbased capital and leverage-based guidelines of the\nFederal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to\nmaintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR.\nFailure to meet these minimum requirements could cause\nthe Federal Reserve to take action.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-\nrelated commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13\nfor further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following\ntable summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.\nThe Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will\nbe utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower\nnotice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card\nlines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant\ndecreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\n276    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nOf…\nsh…\nle…\nfi…\nin…\ngu…\nand\not…\nco…\nBy\nre…\nma…\nat\nDe…\n31,       Con…\n(in       amo…         Exp…         Exp…\nmi…       2022         aft…         aft…\nLe…       Exp…            1            3\nCo…       in 1         year         yea…         Exp…\nex…       year         thr…         thr…         aft…                                      Ca…\ncr…         or            3            5            5                       2021           va…\nca…       less         yea…         yea…         yea…         To…           Tot…           20…             2021\nRe…\nRe…    $  5,1…      $  3,5…      $  6,5…      $  6,0…      $  21…        $  32,…            75              100\nEs…\nAu…\nand       10,…            1            —         1,5…         12…           12,…             —                2\not…\nTo…\nco…\nex…       15,…         3,5…         6,5…         7,6…         33…           45,…            75              102\ncr…\nca…\nCr…       821…            —            —            —         82…           730…             —                —\nca…\nTo…       837…         3,5…         6,5…         7,6…         85…           775…            75              102\nco…\nWh…\nOt…\nun…\nco…       83,…         132…         201…         22,…         44…           453…           2,…    -h       2,0…\nto\nex…\ncr…\nSt…\nle…\nof\ncr…       13,…         8,2…         4,5…         1,0…         27…           28,…           408              476\nand\not…\nfi…\ngu…\nOt…\nle…       3,6…          343           98            1         4,…           4,4…             6                9\nof\ncr…\nTo…       101…         140…         206…         23,…         47…           486…           2,…             2,5…\nwh…\nTo…    $  938…      $  144…      $  213…      $  31,…      $  1,…        $  1,2…        $  2,…          $  2,6…\nle…\nOt…\ngu…\nand\nco…\nSe…\nle…\nin…    $  283…      $     —      $     —      $     —      $  28…        $  337…        $    —          $     —\nag…\nand\ngu…\nDe…\nqu…       5,0…          466         12,…         41,…         59…           55,…           649              475\nas\ngu…\nUn…\nre…\nand       116…          715            —            —         11…           103…            -2                1\nse…\nbo…\nag…\nUn…\nre…\nand       65,…          534            —            —         66…           74,…            -7                —\nse…\nlo…\nag…\nLo…\nsa…\nand\nse…\nin…\nMo…\nre…             NA           NA           NA           NA          NA             NA        76               61\nli…\nLo…\nso…             NA           NA           NA           NA     820            827            28               19\nwi…\nre…\nEx…\n&\ncl…\nho…       191…            —            —            —         19…           182…             —                —\ngu…\nand\nco…\nOt…\ngu…       4,8…          723          209         2,8…         8,…           10,…            53               69\nand\nco…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $ 71million\nand $ 44million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 8.2billion and $ 7.9billion,\nrespectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $ 512million and $ 451million,\nrespectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are\nshown gross of risk participations.\n(e) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification\nagreements was $ 298.5billion and $ 357.4billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of\ncash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(f) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored\nmember repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing\nhouses.\n(g) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, primarily includes unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity\ninvestments, unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, and other equity investment commitments.\n(h) At December 31, 2022, includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the\nbridge financing portfolio.\n(i) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and\nthe guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value\noption was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    277\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of\ncommitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper\nfacilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well\nas committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount\nequal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a\ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform\nunder a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and\nthe guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of\nconsideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records\nthis fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation\nis recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any\nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds\nis allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For\nthese indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time\nor when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications\nare included in the table on page 277. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2022                                              2021\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of\ncredit and                                        credit and\nDecember 31,    other                                             other                                   Other\n(in             financial                        Other letters    financial                             letters\nmillions)       guarantees                           of credit    guarantees                          of credit\nInvestment-…                     $  19,205    $          3,040                     $  19,998    $         3,087\nNoninvestme…                         8,234               1,094                         8,532              1,361\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  27,439    $          4,134                     $  28,530    $         4,448\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $      82    $              6                     $     123    $             9\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              326                   —                           353                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     408    $              6                     $     476    $             9\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  15,296    $            795                     $  14,511    $           999\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\n278    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s\nsecurities lending program, counterparties’\nsecurities, via custodial and non-custodial\narrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of\nthis program, the Firm provides an indemnification in\nthe lending agreements which protects the lender\nagainst the failure of the borrower to return the lent\nsecurities. To minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or\nother highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan\nfrom the borrower. Collateral is marked to market\ndaily to help assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is called from the\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit the\nlending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal\ninvested. To minimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market\nvalue exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nThese contracts include written put options that\nrequire the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by\nthe option holder at a specified price by a specified\ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written\nput option contracts in order to meet client needs, or\nfor other trading purposes. The terms of written put\noptions are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives\ndeemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as “stable value\nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of\nthe difference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been met.\nStable value products are transacted in order to allow\ninvestors to realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected portfolio. These\ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to\nterminate the contract under certain conditions. The\nnotional value of derivative guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However,\nexposure to certain stable value products is\ncontractually limited to a substantially lower\npercentage of the notional amount. The fair value of\nderivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the\nFirm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to\nperform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures\nto these contracts by entering into offsetting\ntransactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge\nthe market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in millions)                                      December 31, 2022               December 31, 2021\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  59,180                       $  55,730\nStable value contracts with                31,820                          29,778\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        2,063                           2,882\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                           649                             475\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal course\nof business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty.\nThe Firm also enters into repurchase and securities\nloaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the counterparty. Such\nagreements settle at a future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets until settlement date. These agreements\npredominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer\nto Note 11 for a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-\nrelated indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has\nmade representations and warranties that the loans\nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require\nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify\nthe loan purchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations\nis separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing\nits litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products on\nboth a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse\nservicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is\nthe cost of temporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse\nservicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk\nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie\nMae\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    279\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when\nforeclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding\nprincipal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying\nproperty. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of\nfuture credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal\nbalance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of\nthe Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the\ntable on page 277. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with\nissuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of\nthe securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on\npayments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities\nif such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the\nlicensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party\n(“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages\nthat may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due\nto actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s\nmaximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes\nin tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on\nhistorical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of\npayment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-\nback to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s\nissuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.\nIf the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited\nor refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers\nthe payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the\nFirm processed an aggregate volume of $ 2,158.4billion, $ 1,886.7billion, and $ 1,597.3billion, respectively.\nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities\npurchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects\ncash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them\nto the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a\ndaily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a\nderivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the\ncontract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable\nto clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client\nthrough the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions.\nThe Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the\nclearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and\naccess available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining\nshortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance\nrisk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the\nclients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member,\nas this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon\nhistorical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that\nthe Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be\nremote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records\nin its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and\nclearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership\nin some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization\nas a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations\nmay be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund\nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a\nmember default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata\nshare of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial\nmargin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required\nshould such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb\nthe losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible\nexposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is\ndisclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored\nmember repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf\nof clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt\nand full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-\nquality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk\nof loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note\n11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral\npledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent\nCompany may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the\nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet\ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees\nis remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by\nJPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company\nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    281\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that\nit owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at\ndiscount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various\nother central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                      2022        2021\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $  110.8    $  126.3\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged       114.8       112.0\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks        567.6       476.4\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  793.2    $  714.7\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities.

Refer to Note 20 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s long-term debt. The\nsignificant components of the Firm’s pledged assets\nwere as follows.\nDecember 31, (in billions)        2022        2021\nInvestment securities         $  104.4    $   80.1\nLoans                            485.9       428.5\nTrading assets and other         202.9       206.1\nTotal pledged assets          $  793.2    $  714.7\nCollateral The Firm accepts financial assets as\ncollateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge,\ndeliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally\nobtained under resale and other securities financing\nagreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-\ninvestment customer receivables and derivative\ncontracts. Collateral is generally used under\nrepurchase and other securities financing agreements,\nto cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative\ncontracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                        2022          2021\nCollateral permitted to be sold or          $  1,346.9    $  1,471.3\nrepledged, delivered, or otherwise used\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or       1,019.4       1,111.0\notherwise used\n282    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 30 – Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous\nlegal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement\nmatters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with\npotentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are\nat varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business\nand several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for\nits legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.2billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which\nthe Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not\nbelieve that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the\nproceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of\nmultiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of\nmany of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where\nthe Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or\nincentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition,\nthe outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the\naggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia\nDevelopment Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was\nserved in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to\npayments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an\naccount at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and\nPetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of\nservice and the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”)\nis investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the\nAmrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions\nbrought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’\npetitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order\nfining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.\nRelatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and\nother parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a\nfurther inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act\n(“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA\ninvestigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository\naccount for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held\napproximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following\nthe settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)\ncommenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts.\nThe FRN alleged that the payments were\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    283\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nwas or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April\n2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. In\nNovember 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining\nFX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before\nthe South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a\nconsolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal\nantitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on\nbehalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement\nclass filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached\nin December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on\nbehalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-\nrelated individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside\nthe U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the\nUK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal\nTribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification\non an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which\nremains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a\nseries of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the\nprice of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012,\nthe parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action was divided\ninto twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief.\nIn September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the\nprior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\n900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December\n2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District\nCourt’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the\namended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance\nwith the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the\nDistrict Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the\nmerchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising\nsimilar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those\nactions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over\nhalf of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s\nsex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was\nfiled in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the\nother case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin\nIslands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss\nboth complaints. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to\ninquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British\nBankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European\nBanking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation\nrelating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European\nCommission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules\nrelating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that\n284    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\ndecision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a\ndefendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,\nincluding U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by\nthe BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in\nvarious stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted\nclass certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants,\nincluding the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was\nadministered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs\nfiled a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful\nagreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit\ncards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an\namended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm’s\nsettlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer\nRate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the\nsettlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation\n. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic\nSecurities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York\nState common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading\nfor securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved\nto certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder\nputative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have\nbeen filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of\nthese shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S.\ntreasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC\nin September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court\nof the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to\nthe historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the\nresolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full.\nA second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of\nfiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence\nlitigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is\npending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who\nacquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings\nof the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the\nhistorical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A\nseparate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the\nalleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records\npreservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the\nSEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. * * * In addition to the various\nlegal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise\ninvolved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the\nclaims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself\nvigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established\nreserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of\nU.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its\noutstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such\nreserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel.\nThe Firm’s legal expense was $ 266million, $ 426million and $ 1.1billion for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    285\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the\noutcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or\nwhere the matters present novel legal theories,\ninvolve a large number of parties or are in early\nstages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing of their\nultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,\npenalties or consequences related to those matters.\nJPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal proceedings\ndescribed above and after taking into account its\ncurrent litigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses, that the other\nlegal proceedings currently pending against it should\nnot have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s\nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes,\nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties involved\nin such proceedings, there is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it has currently\naccrued or that a matter will not have material\nreputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of\na particular matter may be material to JPMorgan\nChase’s operating results for a particular period,\ndepending on, among other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan\nChase’s income for that period.\n286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 31 – International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major\ninternational geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation\nas business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is\nbased predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed,\nbooking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve\ninternational businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have\nbeen made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within\nincome tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or\nby the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety\nof factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is\nmeasured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s\nperformance. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the\nGSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions,\njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the\nLOBs may change.\nSegment results and reconciliation (a)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    289\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n…\n…                                        …                                       …\n…       …                …               …       …                …               …      …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  …     $  …            $  …              …    $         …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               —        —               —              …              …\n…        …               …               —        —               —              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …              …              …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —              …    $         …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —              …    $         …\n…        …               …                  …        …               …           …              …\n…        …               …               …        …               …           …         %    …\n…        …               …               …        …               …           …              …\n(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact\nrecorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    295\nChanges in net interest income, volume and rate analysis\nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between\nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in\nthe table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and\nrates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated\nseparately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net\nspread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result,\nchanges in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result,\nand due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended               2022 versus\nDecember 31,                    2021                                 2021 versus 2020\n(On a                Increase/(decr…                                 Increase/(decre…\ntaxable-equiv…         due to change                                    due to change\nbasis;

These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to\nthe extent available and forecasted data where actual\ndata is not available. As a result, the estimated\ncollateral values used to calculate these ratios do\nnot represent actual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are\nnecessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed\nas estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien\npositions, as well as unused lines, related to the\nproperty.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio\nabove normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans\nare subject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting\nspecified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good\ncredit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

          "content": "Part I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well\nas the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a\nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding\ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject\nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The\nFederal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the\nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan\nChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by\nadditional authorities based on the activities or\nlicenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and,\nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and regulated by the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated\nby the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the\n“PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\n(“FCA”).\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated\nby the European Central Bank (“ECB”) as well as the\nlocal regulators in each of the countries in which it\noperates. The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are\nregulated by the banking, securities, prudential and\nconduct regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the\ncountries in which they operate.\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business\nactivities other than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted\nto engage in a broader range of financial activities.\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nactivities if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also\nimpose corrective capital and/or managerial\nrequirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are\npersistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s\ndepository institutions. If any depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory\nrating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the\nFederal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its\nsubsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other\nthan\nthose permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries\nand branches are also subject to local capital and\nliquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial\ninstitutions. U.S. banking regulators have announced\ntheir support for the issuance of the Basel III\nreforms and are considering how to appropriately apply\nsuch reforms in the U.S.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104.\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an\nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking\ninto account the results of separate stress tests\ndesigned by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The\nFederal Reserve uses the results under the severely\nadverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to\ndetermine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)\nrequirement for the coming year, which forms part of\nthe Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is\nrequired to file its annual CCAR submission on April\n5, 2023. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of\nits indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2023 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The Firm’s\nfinal SCB requirement will become effective on October\n1, 2023. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to\nperform separate, similar stress tests annually. The\nFirm publishes each year the results of the annual\nstress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse”\nscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nmore information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate\nto identify and monitor risks to the financial\nstability of the U.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and\nreporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial institutions\n(“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve\nhas adopted several rules to implement those\nheightened prudential standards, including rules\nrelating to risk management and corporate governance\nof subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under\nthese rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and\noverall risk\n4\nmanagement standards, including oversight by the board\nof directors of risk management activities.\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nmaintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated\nannually, summarizing the actions it would take to\nremain well-capitalized and well-funded in order to\navoid failure in the case of an adverse event. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to\nprepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the\nOCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution\nin the event of material distress or failure (a\n“resolution plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal\nReserve revised the regulations governing resolution\nplan requirements, and on the basis of those\nrevisions, the Firm’s resolution plan submissions will\nalternate between “targeted” and “full” plans. The\nFirm’s “targeted” resolution plan was filed on June\n28, 2021, and the Firm's next \"full\" resolution plan\nis due to be filed on or before July 1, 2023. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and\nsubmit a separate resolution plan as directed by the\nFDIC on or before December 1, 2023.\nCertain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and\nbranches are also subject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its\nsubsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution\nunder an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S.\nTreasury Secretary, in consultation with the President\nof the United States, must first make certain\ndeterminations concerning extraordinary financial\ndistress and systemic risk, and action must be\nrecommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.\nAbsent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain\nsubject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The\nFDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing\nits “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of\nSIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which\nseeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and\nimpose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC\nin receivership according to their statutory order of\npriority.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the\nFederal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and\ntheir banks are subject to requirements, limitations\nand prohibitions established by law and by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are\nrequired to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares\nof an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by\nfinancial companies are prohibited if, as a result of\nthe acquisition, the total liabilities of the\nfinancial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore,\nfor certain acquisitions, the Firm must\nprovide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to\nacquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of\nany voting shares of any company with over $10 billion\nin assets that is engaged in activities that are\n“financial in nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage\nin a broader range of activities (including\nacquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the\nauthority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or any\nof its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to\nmeet applicable eligibility requirements.\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to\nobligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution\nAgreement entered into with the Department of Justice\non September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and\nU.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as\nunder a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those\nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could include limiting\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities, or imposing\ncorrective capital or managerial requirements on the\nbank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on banks, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad\npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the\napproval of the institution’s creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to a depository\ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the\nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the\nundercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In\ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration\nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established\nguidelines setting forth heightened standards for\nlarge banks, including minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s\nrisk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s\nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from\nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.\nThe bank’s board or risk\n5",

JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of\ncredit to, investments in stock or securities of, and\nderivatives, securities lending and certain other\ntransactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain\nother affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from\nsuch subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in\nspecified amounts and comply with certain other\nrequirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations\non the payment of dividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the\namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\ncould pay, at January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase\nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The\nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank\nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of\nthe financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of\na receiver of an insured depositary institution\n(“IDI”) for administrative expense and the claims of\nholders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the\nFDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually\npayable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have\npriority over the claims of other unsecured creditors\nof the institution, including depositors in non-U.S.\nbranches and public noteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal\nconsumer protection laws, including laws relating to\nfair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices in connection with the\noffer, sale or provision of consumer financial\nproducts and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction\nover small business lending activities with respect to\nfair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As\npart of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions against firms\nthat offer certain products and services to consumers\nusing practices that are deemed to be unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB\nproposed a rule that would significantly reduce and\nlimit the late payment fees that credit card issuers,\nincluding the Firm, would be permitted to charge to\ncustomers. The Firm’s consumer activities are also\nsubject to regulation under state statutes which are\nenforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency\nof each state.\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through\nJ.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides\nretail investment management services through Nutmeg\nSaving\nand Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated\nby the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by\nthe FCA with respect to their conduct of financial\nservices in the U.K., including obligations relating\nto the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is also\nregulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator with\nrespect to its operation and use of payment systems.\nIn addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg\nare subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and\nbrokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations\nof the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange,\namong others. The Firm conducts similar securities\nactivities outside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities\nare conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-\ndealers are subject to laws and regulations covering\nall aspects of the securities business, including\nsales and trading practices, securities offerings,\npublication of research reports, use of customer\nfunds, the financing of client purchases, capital\nstructure, record-keeping and retention, and the\nconduct of their directors, officers and employees.\nRefer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96\nfor information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are\nsubject to significant regulation in jurisdictions\naround the world relating to, among other things, the\nsafeguarding and management of client assets,\nofferings of funds and marketing activities. Certain\nof the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and\nsubject to oversight by, the SEC as investment\nadvisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered\ninvestment advisers in the United States are subject\nto the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under\nthe Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable\nstate and federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary\nactivities are subject to supervision by the OCC.\nDerivatives regulation:\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its\nderivatives businesses, including regulations that\nimpose capital and margin requirements, require\ncentral clearing of standardized over-the-counter\n(“OTC”) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized\nOTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and\nprovide for reporting of certain mandated information.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nand J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the\nCFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are\nregistered with the SEC as “security-based swap\ndealers”. As a result, these entities are subject to a\ncomprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their\nswap or security-based swap activities, including\ncapital requirements, rules requiring the\ncollateralization of uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps, rules regarding\n6\nsegregation of counterparty collateral, business\nconduct and documentation standards, record-keeping\nand reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-\nmanipulation requirements. Similar requirements have\nalso been established under the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as\nimplemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the\nCFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member\nof the National Futures Association.\nData, privacy and cybersecurity regulation:\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws,\nrules and regulations globally concerning data,\nincluding data protection, consumer protection,\nprivacy, cybersecurity and related matters. These\nlaws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving,\nsubject to interpretation, remain a focus of\nregulators globally, may be enforced by private\nparties or government bodies, and will continue to\nhave a significant impact on all of the Firm’s\nbusinesses and operations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal\ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA\nincludes a variety of record-keeping and reporting\nrequirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-\ncustomer documentation requirements. The Firm is also\nsubject to the regulations and economic sanctions\nprograms administered and enforced by the U.S.\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)\nand EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in countries that\nare, involved in activities including terrorism,\nhostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.\nThe Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws,\nrules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which\nit operates, including those that conflict with or\nprohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying\nwith certain laws, rules and regulations to which it\nis otherwise subject.\nAnti-Corruption:\nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices:\nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to\noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other\nagencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued\nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to\nensure that incentive compensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking\nthat threatens the organizations’ safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has\nalso established standards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm’s compensation\npractices are also subject to regulation and oversight\nby regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the\nFifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as\nimplemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which\nincludes compensation-related provisions. The European\nBanking Authority has instituted guidelines on\ncompensation policies including under CRD V which in\ncertain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or\nsupplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The\nU.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD\nV compensation policies. The Firm expects that the\nimplementation of regulatory guidelines regarding\ncompensation in the U.S. and other countries will\ncontinue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which\nthe Firm structures its compensation programs and\npractices.\nOther significant international regulatory\ninitiatives:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement\na program of regulatory enhancements relating to\nfinancial services, several key elements of which are\ndiscussed below.\nMiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain\nstandardized OTC derivatives to take place on\nspecified trading venues. MiFID II also significantly\nenhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade\ntransparency, transaction reporting and investor\nprotection, and introduced a position limits and\nreporting regime for commodities. In November 2021,\nthe European Commission (“EC”) published a draft\nlegislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II\nfocused on changes to rules related to transparency\nand market structure, including the proposed creation\nof a consolidated tape intended to increase\ntransparency into trading across the EU by providing a\ncentralized source of market data. This legislation\nremains subject to review by the European Parliament\nand European Council.\nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the\n“Wholesale Markets Review”, a set of proposals\ndesigned to streamline and improve regulation of the\nU.K. secondary markets following the U.K.’s departure\nfrom the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal\nof the requirement to execute trades in shares on\ncertain trading venues, have been introduced through\nthe Financial Services and Markets Bill (“FSMB”),\nwhich is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament\nin the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as\namendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency,\nwill be subject to further consultation, which is\nexpected during 2023.\n7",

          "content": "Part I\nIn December 2022, the EC published a legislative\nproposal to amend EMIR to increase the competitiveness\nof the EU central clearing framework and to enhance\nsupervision of EU central counterparties (“CCPs”).\nThese proposals are subject to further review by the\nEuropean Parliament and European Council .\nThe EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the\nCentral Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”)\nwhich will impose requirements relating to sourcing of\nsecurities in the event of a settlement fail. In June\n2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to postpone\nthe application of these rules until November 2025.\nThe amendment remains subject to review by the\nEuropean Parliament and European Council.\nIn December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nannounced an extensive package of reforms to U.K.\nfinancial services regulation known as the “Edinburgh\nReforms”. These reforms aim to drive growth and\ncompetitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector\nfollowing the U.K.’s departure from the EU. The reform\npackage includes initiatives relating to a number of\nareas of financial services policy, including retail\nbanks, payments, markets, digital assets and\nsustainable finance. The U.K. Government and\nregulators are expected to release further\nconsultations and announcements related to these\nreforms in 2023.\nEU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the\nrules implementing the Basel III framework during\n2023. The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the\nU.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III\nfinal rules by January 2025, allowing for certain\ntransitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032,\nrespectively. The main changes implemented by the\nBasel III final rules will be revisions to the credit\nrisk and operational risk calculation methods to\nreduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling\napproaches and introduce internationally-agreed\nchanges to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III\nfinal rules also strengthen enforcement tools for\nsupervisors overseeing EU banks and require EU banking\nentities to systematically identify, disclose and\nmanage environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\nrisks as part of their risk management practices. In\naddition, in December 2022, the European Banking\nAuthority (“EBA”) announced that it will publish rules\nand technical standards between 2023 and 2025 related\nto sustainable finance, which will be applicable to EU\nbanks. The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. will be\nrequired to comply with regulatory policies and\nstandards related to climate risk being developed by\nthe PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that\ncertain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an\nintermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in the\nEU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be\nestablished if a single IPU would conflict with “home\ncountry” bank separation rules or impede\nresolvability. The Firm will be required to comply\nwith the EU’s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.\nThe Firm’s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are\nalso subject to supervisory expectations published by\nthe ECB\nand the PRA, respectively, for management of financial\nrisks arising from climate change and the increasing\noperational reliance on IT systems, third-party\nservices and innovative technologies, as well as\nsupervisory expectations for operational resilience\nand resilience from macro-financial and geopolitical\nshocks. These expectations address bank strategy,\ngovernance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk\nreporting and disclosure.\nPolicymakers in the EU have continued to implement\nsustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022,\nthe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n(“CSRD”) was published in the Official Journal of the\nEU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the\nscope and content of ESG reporting requirements under\nthe EU’s existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting\nrequirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In\naddition, the EC published its legislative proposal on\nthe Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive\n(“CSDDD”) in February 2022. The draft directive sets\nmandatory due diligence obligations for companies to\naddress actual and potential human rights violations\nand environmental adverse impacts stemming from their\nown operations and business relationships, including\nthe activities of companies with which they have\nestablished business relationships. The proposed\nlegislation may also require the adoption of company-\nspecific climate-related transition plans. The CSDDD\nis currently subject to review by the European\nParliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and\nCSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm’s EU entities\nas well as to certain non-EU entities.\n8",

JPMorgan Chase must comply with\nthe laws, rules and regulations that apply to its\noperations in all of the jurisdictions around the\nworld in which it does business, and financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to\nextensive regulation and supervision.\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase\nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations, and JPMorgan\nChase could be required to make changes to its\nbusiness and operations in response to supervisory\nexpectations or decisions or to new or changed laws,\nrules and regulations. These types of developments\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional\ncosts in connection with complying with applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its\nprofitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry\ninto or acquisition of a new business or an increase\nin its principal investments may require JPMorgan\nChase to comply with additional laws, rules, and\nregulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase\nhas in the past been and could in the future be,\nrequired to:\nlimit the products and services that it offers\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its\nmarket-making activities\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that\nit might otherwise pursue\npay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum\nglobal tax regime), assessments, levies or other\ngovernmental charges, including in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\nincur losses, including with respect to fraudulent\ntransactions perpetrated against its customers\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities,\nor\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and\nservices, which could reduce the demand for them.\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws,\nrules and regulations to which it is subject could\nresult in:\nincreased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\nregulatory and governmental enforcement actions\nthe imposition of fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nincreased exposure to litigation, or\nharm to its reputation.\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services\nregulation can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses, operations and financial results.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as the size\nof the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized\nor operates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation and\nregulatory scrutiny\nfinancial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation, or may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not have the same\nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies which supervise more diversified financial\nservices firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a\nparticular jurisdiction may favor financial\ninstitutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework\ncan result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to\ncompetitors that are less regulated or not subject to\nregulation, especially with respect to unregulated\nfinancial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways\nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are implemented in the\nU.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorgan Chase does business. For\n10\nexample, when adopting rules that are intended to\nimplement a global regulatory standard, a national\nregulator may introduce additional or more restrictive\nrequirements, which can create competitive\ndisadvantages for financial services firms, such as\nJPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced\nregulations.\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have\nadopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict\nwith or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise\nsubject, creating conflict of law issues that also\nincrease its risks of non-compliance in those\njurisdictions.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant\nmodifications to its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant countries or regions in\norder to comply with those requirements. These include\nlaws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or\nproposed relating to:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital\nor liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nto implement processes within locally-based\nsubsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements\nthe separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking\nproducts and services from markets activities\nthe resolution of financial institutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions\non exchanges or through central counterparties\n(“CCPs”)\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorgan\nChase to:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs\nincur higher operational and compliance costs\nchange the prices that it charges for its products\nand services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to\nits customers and clients\ncurtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\nbecome subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses, results of operations and\nprofitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral\nconsequences, and could result in higher compliance\ncosts or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and\nscrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other\npenalties and experienced other repercussions in\nconnection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan\nChase could become subject to similar regulatory or\ngovernmental resolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements of any such\nresolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and compliance costs,\nincluding devoting substantial resources to the\nrequired remediation, or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have\ndemonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions\nagainst financial institutions and have required that\ninstitutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or\nadmit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nResolutions of this type can have significant\ncollateral consequences for the subject financial\ninstitution, including:\nloss of clients, customers and business\nrestrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\n11",

For example, conducting\nbusiness could require JPMorgan Chase to devote\nsignificant additional resources to understanding, and\nmonitoring changes in, local laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as structuring its operations to\ncomply with local laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementing and administering related internal\npolicies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in compliance\nwith the laws, rules and regulations of all of the\njurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of\nnon-compliance can be greater in countries that have\nless predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or curtail\nits businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those\nagencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly\nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the\nrequirements for resolution plans may be modified from\ntime to time. Any such determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes\nto its legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to\nserve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements\nor restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities\nor operations. The agencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest\nassets or businesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and\nstrategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter into\na resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\n12\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible\nLTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s\noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to\nenter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will absorb the\nlosses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that\nonly the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue\nnormal operations or subsequently be divested or wound\ndown in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent\nCompany’s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on\nits unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of\nthose securities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries\nand to the claims of priority (as determined by\nstatute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in\nbankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would realize value\nonly to the extent available to the Parent Company as\na shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nother subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point\nof entry recapitalization model could be a desirable\nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title\nII. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a\nsingle point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into,\na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan\nChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under whatever\nstrategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than\nthey might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred\nstrategy.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical developments can negatively impact JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries\ncan cause uncertainty in the economic environment and\nmarket conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its\nbusinesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives,\nas well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could\nsignificantly affect U.S. and global economic growth\nand cause higher volatility in the financial markets,\nincluding:\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal\nReserve and other central banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained large-scale asset\npurchases or any suspension or reversal of those\nactions\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation\nand spending\nactions that governments take or fail to take in\nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the\nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics,\nas well as the effectiveness of any actions taken\ngovernmental actions or initiatives relating to\nclimate risk, or more generally, the impact of\nbusiness activities on environmental, social and\ngovernance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of\nclimate and ESG-related risks\nisolationist foreign policies\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other\ngeopolitical instabilities\neconomic or financial sanctions\nthe implementation of tariffs and other\nprotectionist trade policies, or\nother governmental policies or actions adopted or\ntaken in response to political or social pressures.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty\nabout the possible outcomes of these developments,\ncould:\nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and\nfinancial markets, which could potentially undermine\nthe status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency\nprovoke retaliatory countermeasures by other\ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in\nregulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations\nlead to the withdrawal of government support for\nagencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal\nNational Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S.\nGSEs”)\nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government\nwill be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at\nany particular time\n13",

portfolio, reduce its liquidity\nand capital levels, increase the allowance for credit\nlosses or lead to higher net charge offs, hamper its\nability to deliver products and services to its\nclients and customers, and weaken its results of\noperations and financial condition.\nJPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations\nmay also be adversely affected by actions or\ninitiatives by national, state or local governmental\nauthorities that:\nseek to discourage financial institutions from doing\nbusiness with companies engaged in certain industries,\nor conversely, to penalize financial institutions that\nelect not to do business with such companies, or\nmandate specific business practices that companies\noperating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction may\ndiffer or conflict with those in other jurisdictions,\nJPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences\nregardless of the course of action it takes or

including under\nantitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and\nregulations, and\nharm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists and\nother stakeholders.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability\nto transact with clients and customers, and with\ngovernmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely\naffected if its decisions with respect to doing\nbusiness with companies in certain sensitive\nindustries are perceived to harm those companies or to\nalign with

of these are affected by global economic, market\nand political events and conditions, as well as\nregulatory restrictions.\n14\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and\nmarket-making businesses can suffer losses due to\nunanticipated market events, including:\nsevere declines in asset values\nunexpected credit events\nunforeseen events or conditions that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to become correlated\n(and vice versa)\nthe inability to effectively hedge market and other\nrisks related to market-making and investment\nportfolio positions, or\nother market risks that may not have been\nappropriately taken into account in the development,\nstructuring or pricing of a financial instrument.\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in\nits investment portfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively\naffected by adverse economic conditions and\ngovernmental policies.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly\naffected by U.S. and global economic conditions,\nincluding:\npersonal and household income distribution\nunemployment or underemployment\nprolonged periods of exceptionally low or high\ninterest rates\nhousing prices\nthe level of inflation and its effect on prices for\ngoods and services\nconsumer and small business confidence levels, and\nchanges in consumer spending or in the level of\nconsumer debt.\nHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment\nthat result in reduced personal and household income\ncould negatively affect consumer credit performance to\nthe extent that consumers are less able to service\ntheir debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or\nnegative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand\nfor the products and services offered by JPMorgan\nChase’s consumer businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which\ncan reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These\nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain\ngeographies and industry segments where declining\nindustrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in\nor could result in higher levels of unemployment, or\nwhere high levels of consumer debt, such as\noutstanding\nstudent loans, could impair the ability of customers\nto pay their other consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses\ncould also be adversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment status\nand housing, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as\nhigher taxes and increased regulation which could\nresult in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale\nbusinesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for\nwhich it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions.\nThese factors can also influence the willingness of\nother financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that\nJPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant\nand sustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s\ncapital markets businesses, including its loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and leveraged\nlending activities, could be reduced to the extent\nthat those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations\nin unfavorable market conditions, or\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss,\nor hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular\nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe\ndownturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that affect specific economic sectors, could\nhave a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan\nChase whose operations or financial condition are\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on the health or\nstability of those market segments or economic\nsectors, as well as clients that are engaged in\nrelated businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit\nlosses on its loans and other credit commitments to\nclients that operate in, or are dependent on, any\nsector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuations of\nclient assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or\n15",

Substantial and unexpected\nwithdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper\nthe investment performance of the fund, particularly\nif the outflows create the need for the fund to\ndispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or\nprices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on\nthe weaker investment performance.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that results in shifts in consumer and\nbusiness spending could also have a negative impact on\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and\nthereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its\nwholesale operations. For example, the businesses of\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are\ndependent on consistent streams of rental income from\ncommercial real estate properties which are owned or\nbeing built by those clients. Sustained adverse\neconomic conditions could result in reductions in the\nrental cash flows that owners or developers receive\nfrom their tenants which, in turn, could depress the\nvalues of the properties and impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their commercial\nreal estate loans. These consequences could result in\nJPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance\nfor credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and\ncharge-offs within its commercial real estate loan\nportfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a\nlarger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its\nwholesale businesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its\nliquidity or its capital levels.\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan\nChase can generally be expected to earn higher net\ninterest income. However, higher interest rates can\nalso lead to:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to\nhigher financing costs for clients\nthe loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that interest\nrates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those\nof competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect\nassumptions about depositor behavior\nlosses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held\nin the investment securities portfolio\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce\ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of\nshort-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels.\nHigher interest rates can also negatively affect the\npayment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s\nconsumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked\nto variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable\nrate loans are unable to afford higher interest\npayments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making\npayments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur\nlosses and increased operational costs related to\nservicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could\nreduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its\ninvestment securities portfolio to the extent that it\nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s\nmortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby\ndecreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive\nfor JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit\nspreads may widen or narrow not only in response to\nevents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan\nChase but also as a result of general economic and\ngeopolitical events and conditions. Changes in\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect,\npositively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on\ncertain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are\nrecorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the\nvalue of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets can be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and other disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may make it extremely difficult to\nvalue certain financial instruments. Subsequent\nvaluations of financial instruments in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, at the time of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their\n16\ncurrent fair value. Any of these factors could cause a\ndecline in the value of financial instruments that\nJPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets,\nwhich may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s\nresults of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure\nto more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan\nChase’s hedging and other risk management strategies\nmay not be effective, and it could incur significant\nlosses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,\nsecurities exchanges and government entities within\nand outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose\nJPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and\ncounterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses\nor liability where a financial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services for client\nassets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud\nor the failure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations, or where clients are unable to access\nassets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to\ngovernmental actions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure\nof, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes\ncontracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby increasing its operational\ncosts and potentially resulting in losses. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a\nmember of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a\nmember defaults on its obligations to the CCP because\nof requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a\nportion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase\ncan be subject to bearing its share of non-default\nlosses incurred by a CCP, including losses from\ncustodial, settlement or investment activities or due\nto cyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan\nChase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its\nclients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring\nclients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase\nis also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its\nclients in connection with providing cash management,\nclearing, custodial and other transaction services to\nthose clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase\nprovides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent,\nJPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the\nclient’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational and\nlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses\nto the extent that any collateral that it has received\nis insufficient to cover those losses.\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks.\nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim\nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond\nthe legal authority of those officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous incumbent\ngovernment. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct\nbusiness in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could\nlimit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or\nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments,\nwhich could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives\ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement\nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan\nChase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit losses. These\nconsequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto effectively manage its credit risk exposure from\nits market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan\nChase’s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant\nmarket participant, such as a major financial\ninstitution or a CCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market participant or its\nability to fulfill its obligations, can cause\nsubstantial and cascading disruption within the\nfinancial markets, including in circumstances where\ncoordinated action by multiple other market\nparticipants is required to address the failure or\ndisruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event, particularly\nif it leads to other market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or\ndefaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with, and credit\nexposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased\nwhen:\nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of\nthe collateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning\nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant\n17",
