In addition, JPMorgan Chase can\nbe exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which\nJPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its\nobligations to the CCP because of requirements that\neach member of the CCP absorb a portion of those\nlosses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to\nbearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a\nCCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or\ninvestment activities or due to cyber or other\nsecurity breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan\nChase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its\nclients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring\nclients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase\nis also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its\nclients in connection with providing cash management,\nclearing, custodial and other transaction services to\nthose clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase\nprovides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent,\nJPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the\nclient’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase\nmay suffer losses to the extent that any collateral\nthat it has received is insufficient to cover those\nlosses.\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks.\nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim\nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond\nthe legal authority of those officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous incumbent\ngovernment. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct\nbusiness in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could\nlimit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or\nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments,\nwhich could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives\ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement\nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan\nChase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit losses. These\nconsequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto effectively manage its credit risk exposure from\nits market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan\nChase’s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant\nmarket participant, such as a major financial\ninstitution or a CCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market participant, can\nhave a cascading effect within the financial markets.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event, particularly\nif it leads to other market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or\ndefaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with, and credit\nexposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased\nwhen:\nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of\nthe collateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning\nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or illiquidity,\nand JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the fair value of\ncollateral or to manage declines in the value of\ncollateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising\nfrom concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market\nrisk to the extent that groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations to\nbe similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit\nquality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or\ncounterparties could lead to concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties\nin similar, related or dependent industries. This type\nof interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s\ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses, including fair\nvalue losses in its market-making businesses and\ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may\nbe required to increase the allowance for credit\nlosses with respect to certain clients or industries\nin order to align with directives or expectations of\nits banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect\na particular industry or geographic area could lead to\nconcerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s\nborrowers or counterparties not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These\nconditions could also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of\n18\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those\nareas or work in those affected industries or related\nor dependent industries to meet their obligations to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors\nvarious segments of its credit and market risk\nexposures to assess the potential risks of\nconcentration or contagion, but its efforts to\ndiversify or hedge its exposures against those risks\nmay not be successful.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by\nbank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition\nfor certain types of consumer loans could prompt\nindustry-wide reactions such as significant reductions\nin the pricing or margins of those loans or the making\nof loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently default on their\nloans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an\neconomic downturn or other factors, this could impair\ntheir ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan\nChase and result in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly, widespread\ndefaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s\nconsumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an\nenvironment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks associated\nwith those positions and the level of RWA that\nJPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These\nfactors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s\ncapital position, funding costs and the profitability\nof its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any\ngiven time by factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements,\nincluding as a result of changes in laws, rules and\nregulations\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, during periods of market stress,\nlow investor confidence and significant market\nilliquidity could result in higher\nfunding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its\naccess to some of its traditional sources of\nliquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced.\nAlternative sources of funding could be more expensive\nor limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding\ncosts could also be negatively affected by actions\nthat JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net\nstable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively\nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability\nto fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries,\nand thereby adversely affect its results of\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends\non the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments\non its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds\nthe stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings\nLLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The\nIHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany\nlending to the holding company.\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the\nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior\nand subordinated debt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC\nto make payments to the holding company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions,\nas well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity\nrequirements and other regulatory restrictions on its\nability to make payments to the holding company. The\nIHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the holding company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are\notherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or\nBoard of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the\nholding company to make various payments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect the holding company’s ability\nto:\npay interest on its debt securities\n19",

However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be\nlowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade\ncould occur at times of broader market instability\nwhen JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events\nmay be more limited and general investor confidence is\nlow.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and\nreduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk\non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This\ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe reform and replacement of benchmark rates could\nadversely affect financial instruments issued, funded,\nserviced or held by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to\nlitigation and other disputes.\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other\ntypes of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,”\nincluding those in widespread and longstanding use,\nhave been the subject of ongoing international,\nnational and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives\nfor reform, including:\nchanges to the rules and methodologies under which\ncertain benchmarks are administered\ninitiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the\nuse of certain benchmarks by market participants\nthe introduction of alternative reference rates to\nbe used by market participants in lieu of certain\nbenchmarks, and\nlegislative proposals and actions providing for the\nreplacement of reference rates under existing\ncontracts and instruments that are linked to certain\nbenchmarks with alternative reference rates .\nSome of these reforms are already effective while\nothers are still to be implemented or are under\nconsideration. These and other reforms relating to\nbenchmarks could:\ncause certain benchmarks to be substantially\nmodified or to be permanently discontinued\nlead to disruptions in the financial markets,\nincluding in connection with the transition to\nalternative reference rates\ngive rise to litigation and other disputes\ncause reputational harm to the extent that\noperational and technology systems are not\nsufficiently prepared for the transition to\nalternative reference rates, or\nhave other consequences which cannot be fully\nanticipated.\nAny of these developments, and any future initiatives\nto regulate, reform or change the administration of\nbenchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to\nthe return on, value of and market for loans,\nmortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial\ninstruments whose returns are linked to any such\nbenchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or\nheld by JPMorgan Chase.\nChanges in the manner in which certain benchmarks are\nadministered, or the general increased regulatory\nscrutiny of those benchmarks, could increase the costs\nand risks of administering or otherwise participating\nin the setting of those benchmarks and complying with\nregulations or requirements relating to those\nbenchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of\ndiscouraging market participants from continuing to\nadminister or contribute to certain benchmarks,\ntrigger further changes in the rules or methodologies\nunder which certain benchmarks are\n20\nadministered or lead to the discontinuation of certain\nbenchmarks.\nRegulators, industry bodies and other market\nparticipants in the U.S. and other countries continue\nto engage in initiatives to develop, introduce and\nencourage the use of alternative reference rates to\nreplace certain benchmarks, and certain of these\nalternative rates have gained or are gaining\nacceptance among market participants. However, there\nis no assurance that:\nany of these new rates will be similar to, or\nproduce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks\nthat they seek to replace\narrangements by market participants to prepare for\nthe discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates will be\nfully effective, or\na particular alternative reference rate will be\nwidely accepted by market participants, or that market\nacceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the\nintroduction of other reference rates.\nIf a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and\nan alternative reference rate has not been\nsuccessfully introduced or widely accepted within the\nmarket, this could result in significant adverse\neffects on the financial markets. For example, vast\namounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives\nand other financial instruments are linked to the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark. ICE\nBenchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR,\nhas announced that the publication of the principal\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after June 30,\n2023, and significant progress has been made by\nregulators, industry bodies and market participants to\nintroduce and implement the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S.\ndollar LIBOR. However, if an alternative reference\nrate such as SOFR has not achieved sufficient market\nacceptance when the publication of the principal\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR is discontinued, or if\nmarket participants have not otherwise implemented\neffective transitional arrangements to address that\ndiscontinuation, this could result in widespread\ndislocation in the financial markets, volatility in\nthe pricing of securities, derivatives and other\ninstruments, and the suppression of capital markets\nactivities, all of which could have a negative impact\non JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on U.S.\ndollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other\ninstruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held\nby JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in\nlitigation and other types of disputes with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and investors as a\nconsequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand other benchmark rates to replacement rates,\nincluding claims that JPMorgan Chase has:\ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors unfairly, or caused them to experience\nlosses, higher financing costs or lower returns on\ninvestments\nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of\nthe transition from benchmark rates on the products\nthat JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and\ncustomers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts\nof interest\nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or\ninvestments on behalf of its clients, or sold products\nthat did not serve their intended purpose, in\nconnection with the transition from benchmark rates\nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the\nmanipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in\nconnection with the discontinuation of or transition\nfrom benchmark rates, or\ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors when interpreting or making determinations\nunder the terms of agreements or financial\ninstruments.\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to\nhigher legal expenses and operational costs, require\nit to pay significant amounts in connection with\nresolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its\nreputation.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving regulatory\nrequirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally\nSystemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase\nis required to hold additional capital buffers,\nincluding a GSIB surcharge, a SCB, and a\ncountercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at\nleast annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan\nChase is required to hold in order to satisfy these\nleverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at\nany given time due to factors such as:\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in\nlaws, rules, and regulations\nactions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.\ngovernment in response to the economic effects of\nsystemic events, such as the actions taken in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of\nthe Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits\nheld by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial\ninstitutions and, consequently, an increase in\nleverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge\nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase risk\nweighted assets such as increased market risk,\ncustomer delinquencies, client credit rating\ndowngrades or other factors, and\n21",

In addition to\nproper design, installation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational systems depends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can\nsignificantly compromise the functionality or\nreliability of a particular system and other systems\nto which it transmits or from which it receives\ninformation, and\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately\nmaintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis,\nand to ensure that any changes introduced to its\nsystems are managed carefully to ensure security and\noperational continuity and adhere to all applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of its vendors,\ncustodians and other market participants, including\nclearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities\nexchanges and data processing, security and technology\ncompanies (including those that provide cloud\ncomputing services).\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,\nincluding due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or\nother systems failure, could result in unfavorable\nripple\neffects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan\nChase and its clients and customers, including:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services,\nliquidity or information to clients and customers\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain\naccess to funds and other assets, including those for\nwhich physical settlement and delivery is required\nfailure to timely settle or confirm transactions\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients\nand customers\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing\nservices provided by a system that is unavailable\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan\nChase’s products and services\nregulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase,\nor financial institutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational disruptions, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and\ncomplexity of transactions continue to increase, it\ncan become more challenging to effectively maintain\nand upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and\ninfrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks\nthat:\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase\nor its clients and customers may increase, evolve or\nbecome more complex, particularly during periods of\nmarket disruption or economic uncertainty\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause\nwidespread system disruption\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems compound, or migrate to other\nsystems over time, to become larger issues\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software,\nor degraded performance of microprocessors, could\ncause disruptions in operational systems, or the\ninability of systems to communicate with each other,\nand\nthird parties may attempt to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of\nnewly-acquired businesses or of external parties on\nwhich\n22\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet\nthe requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\noperations or bank regulatory standards, or if they\nfail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan\nChase could be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase\ncould cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber\nattacks on its computer systems, software, networks\nand other technology assets on a daily basis from\nvarious actors, including groups acting on behalf of\nhostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists”\n(i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to\npromote a political agenda or social change) and\nothers. These cyber attacks can take many forms,\nincluding attempts to introduce computer viruses or\nmalicious code, which are commonly referred to as\n“malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These\nattacks are often designed to:\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nsteal money, or\nextort money through the use of so-called\n“ransomware.”\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks which are\nintended to disrupt online banking services.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due\nto cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable\nthat additional breaches will occur in the future. Any\nsuch breach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide\nabsolute security against cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate, detect or\nrecognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches. This is because:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks change\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of\nsources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,\ncyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to\nterrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third\nparties whose objective is to disrupt the operations\nof financial institutions more generally\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network without\nbeing detected, might obtain access to other networks\nand systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such as:\nJPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings and\nits internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud computing\nservices\nthe acquisition of new businesses, and\nthe increased use of remote access and third party\nvideo conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-\nhome arrangements for employees.\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile devices used by\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of\na vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative consequences,\nincluding:\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to operational\nsystems\nmisappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems\nand those of its clients, customers and counterparties\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to\nfully recover and restore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent\nsystems from processing fraudulent transactions\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy\nand other laws\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity\nand business resiliency measures\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\n23",

While such an\ninvestigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by\nthe cyber attack, and that damage may continue to\nspread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s\nability to provide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and regulators, as well as\nthe public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best\nto contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber\nattack, and certain errors or actions could be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could further\nincrease the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to products,\nservices and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services (including mobile\nconnectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing),\nacquires or invests in a business or makes changes to\nan existing product, service or delivery platform, it\nmay not fully appreciate or identify new operational\nrisks that may arise from those changes, or may fail\nto implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant failure\nin this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto operate one or more of its businesses or result in:\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and\ncustomers\nincreased operating expenses\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines,\npenalties and other sanctions\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity\nregulatory intervention, or\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\nresults of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer\nsatisfaction could be adversely affected by the\nfailure of an external operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is\nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be\nsources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems\nfailure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a\nvendor or market\ninfrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly\nconnected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber\nattack involving another party to which such a vendor\nor infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers,\ndata aggregators and other external parties with which\nJPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase\nJPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is\nparticularly the case where activities of customers or\nthose parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and\ncontrol systems, including through the use of the\ninternet, cloud computing services, and personal smart\nphones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that\nparty experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in a\nvariety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and\nits clients and customers, including:\nheightened risk that external parties will be able\nto execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as\npotential liability for losses that exceed thresholds\nestablished in consumer protection laws, rules and\nregulations\nincreased operational costs to remediate the\nconsequences of the external party’s security breach,\nand\nreputational harm arising from the perception that\nJPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of\noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to\nthe systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or\nsystems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or\nhuman error or misconduct affecting other external\nparties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems\nor to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payment processors, financial\ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing\nhouses and other financial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that the disruption of an\noperational system involving one institution or\nentity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause\nindustry-wide operational disruptions that could\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct\nbusiness.\n24\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations rely on its ability, and\nthe ability of key external parties, to maintain\nappropriately-staffed workforces, and on the\ncompetence, trustworthiness, health and safety of\nemployees.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients and\ncustomers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its\nability to staff its operations appropriately and on\nthe competence, integrity, health and safety of its\nemployees. JPMorgan Chase is similarly dependent on\nthe workforces of other parties on which JPMorgan\nChase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians\nand financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses could be materially and adversely\naffected by:\nthe ineffective implementation of business decisions\nany failure to institute controls that appropriately\naddress risks associated with business activities, or\nto appropriately train employees with respect to those\nrisks and controls\nstaffing shortages, particularly in tight labor\nmarkets\na significant operational breakdown or failure,\ntheft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\nother negative outcomes caused by human error or\nmisconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of\nanother party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations\ndepend.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if\nthe measures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to help ensure the health and safety of\nits employees are ineffective, or if any external\nparty on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take\nappropriate and effective actions to protect the\nhealth and safety of its employees.\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational\nrisks in safeguarding personal information.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and\nevolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and\noutside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection\nof personal information of individuals. The protected\nparties can include:\nJPMorgan Chase’s current, prospective and former\nclients and customers\nclients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients\nand customers\ncurrent, prospective and former employees, and\nemployees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors,\ncounterparties and other external parties.\nEnsuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use,\nsharing and storage of personal information comply\nwith all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all\nrelevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of\ndifferent jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\nincrease JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating\ncosts\nhinder the development of new products or services,\ncurtail the offering of existing products or services,\nor affect how products and services are offered to\nclients and customers\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s\nmanagement, and\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses,\noperations and systems in less efficient ways.\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties may\nhave appropriate controls in place to protect the\nconfidentiality of the information exchanged between\nthem and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where\ninformation is transmitted by electronic means.\nJPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if\npersonal information of clients, customers, employees\nor others were to be mishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\nerroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized\nthird parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or\neven the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers, and\nthereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to\ncomply with applicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations may subject it to\ninquiries, examinations and investigations that could\nresult in requirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant liabilities or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of\nthese could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and\notherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving\nthe inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage\nof personal information have led to expanded\ngovernmental scrutiny of practices relating to the\nsafeguarding of personal information by companies in\nthe U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in\nsome cases resulted in, and could in the future lead\nto, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and\nregulations relating to the collection, use, sharing\nand storage of personal information. These types of\nlaws, rules and regulations could prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms such\nas JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among\naffiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and\nthereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict\nJPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing\nor offering products or services to customers. These\nrestrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s\n25",

There\ncan be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency\nplans will fully mitigate all potential business\ncontinuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and\ncustomers and third parties with which it does\nbusiness, or that its resiliency plans will be\nadequate to address the effects of simultaneous\noccurrences of multiple business disruption events. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond\neffectively to a business disruption event could be\nhampered to the extent that the members of its\nworkforce, physical assets or systems and other\nsupport infrastructure needed to address the event are\ngeographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an\nevent were to occur in an area in which they are\nconcentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or\nthe factors that cause or contribute to those events\nbecome more chronic, the disruptive effects of those\nevents on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations,\nand on its clients, customers,\ncounterparties and employees, could become more\nsignificant and long-lasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan\nChase’s operations or operational systems, or the\noccurrence of one or more extraordinary events that\nare beyond its control, could:\nhinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services\nto its clients and customers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including\nfrom loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\ndisrupt market infrastructure systems on which\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\nharm its reputation.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers can\nresult in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing business\nwith vendors and other service providers, including\nstandards relating to the outsourcing of functions as\nwell as the performance of significant banking and\nother functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection with its\ninitiatives to address the risks associated with\noversight of its internal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately\nassess and manage these relationships, especially\nthose involving significant banking functions, shared\nservices or other critical activities, could\nmaterially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase.\nSpecifically, any such failure could result in:\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost\nrevenues\nincreased operational costs, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be\neffective in identifying and mitigating every risk to\nJPMorgan Chase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure, practices,\nmodels or reporting systems could expose it to\nunexpected losses, and its financial condition or\nresults of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse\ncould:\n26\nhinder the timely escalation of material risk issues\nto JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of\nDirectors\nlead to business decisions that have negative\noutcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nrequire significant resources and time to remediate\nlead to non-compliance with laws, rules and\nregulations\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations\nor legal proceedings\nsubject it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\nlead to potential harm to customers and clients, and\nany liability associated with that harm\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various\nrisk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering,\nanalysis and validation processes could result in\nineffective risk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk\nreporting.\nMany of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior and\nto some degree are based on management’s subjective\njudgment or assumptions. For example, many models used\nby JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding\nhistorical correlations among prices of various asset\nclasses or other market indicators. In times of market\nstress, including difficult or less liquid market\nenvironments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic movements could, in some circumstances, limit\nthe effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management\nstrategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations\nor judgments, including those used in its financial\nstatements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital, liquidity,\noperational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses\ninternal models and estimations as a basis for its\nstress testing and in connection with the preparation\nof its financial statements under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of\nassumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The\nmodels and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may\nnot be effective in all cases to identify, observe and\nmitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist\nin the future, including assumptions underlying the\nmodels and estimations such as correlations among\ncertain market indicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or\nmay not be indicative of severely negative market\nconditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or\nlack of liquidity\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices\nof certain loans and securities may make it more\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be\nwell understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, and\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models\nand estimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or the\npreparation of its financial statements prove to have\nbeen inadequate or incorrect. For example, where\nquoted market prices are not available for certain\nfinancial instruments that require a determination of\ntheir fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value\ndeterminations based on internally developed models or\nother means which ultimately rely to some degree on\nmanagement estimates and judgment.\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for\nexpected credit losses related to its credit exposures\nwhich requires difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments including forecasts of how economic\nconditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan\nChase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their\nloans or other obligations. These types of estimates\nand judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a\nvariety of factors, as noted above. In addition,\ncertain models used by JPMorgan Chase as a basis for\nthe determination of the allowance for expected credit\nlosses experienced heightened performance risk in the\neconomic environment during the early stages of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These models are based on\nhistorical experience of internally-developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios, and when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly different from\nthe scenarios\n27",

These\nreviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations for calculating market\nrisk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA\nunder Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or\nestimations are not approved by its regulators, it may\nbe subject to higher capital charges, which could\nadversely affect its financial results or limit the\nability to expand its businesses.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial\nreporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective\nin every circumstance, or that a material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency in internal control over\nfinancial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or\ndeficiencies could result in inaccurate financial\nreporting which, in turn, could:\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapses or deficiencies\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and\nexecute effective business strategies, and to\nanticipate changes affecting those strategies,\nJPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results\ncould suffer.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly\naffect its competitive standing and operations. These\nstrategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it\noffers products and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and\ngoals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately\nassess the competitive landscape and industry trends,\nor fail to address changing regulatory and market\nenvironments or the expectations of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values and growth\nprospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer\nand its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective\nbusiness plans to address these strategic priorities,\nboth in the near term and over longer time horizons.\nManagement’s effectiveness in this regard will affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term\nstability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest\nin market-leading businesses, even in a highly\nstressed environment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\nappropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to social and\nsustainability matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary to\ngrow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations in a given\nperiod.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services\nindustry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to the\nsignificant changes as a result of changes in\nfinancial regulation, technological advances,\nincreased public scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in\nthe U.S. and global financial services industry will\ncontinue to be intense. Competitors include:\nother banks and financial institutions\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\n28\nfinance companies\ntechnology companies, and\nother nonbank firms that are engaged in providing\nsimilar products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were banking\nproducts. These advances have also allowed financial\ninstitutions and other companies to provide electronic\nand internet-based financial solutions, including\nelectronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,\npayments processing and online automated algorithmic-\nbased investment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other products\nand services, including deposits and other traditional\nbanking products, could be significantly disrupted by\nthe use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies\nand other applications that use secure distributed\nledgers, that require no intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could require JPMorgan\nChase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to\nattract and retain clients and customers or to match\nproducts and services offered by its competitors,\nincluding technology companies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers, or breached or\ninfiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways,\nwhich can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations that apply\nto the offering of products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase\nearns from providing products and services through\nthose technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on\nthe pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share,\nparticularly with respect to traditional banking\nproducts. This competition may be on the basis of\nquality and variety of products and services offered,\ntransaction execution, innovation, reputation and\nprice. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses to meet the expectations of clients and\ncustomers, whether due to general market conditions,\nunder-performance, a decision not to offer a\nparticular product or service, changes in client and\ncustomer expectations or other factors, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients\nand customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce\nJPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital\ninvestments in its businesses, or to extend more of\nits capital on behalf of its clients in order to\nremain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely impact\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its businesses, and\nthe activities of its clients and customers, could be\nimpacted by climate change. Climate change could\nmanifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either\nthrough changes in the physical climate or from the\nprocess of transitioning to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding changes in climate policy or in the\nregulation of financial institutions with respect to\nrisks posed by climate change.\nClimate-related physical risks include acute weather\nevents, such as hurricanes and floods, and chronic\nshifts in the climate, such as altered distribution\nand intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or\nflooding, increased frequency of wildfires, rising sea\nlevels, or a rising heat index. Climate-related\nphysical risks could have adverse financial and other\nimpacts on JPMorgan Chase, both directly on its\nbusiness and operations and as a result of impacts to\nits clients and customers, including:\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\nreduced availability of insurance\nsignificant interruptions to business operations,\nincluding supply chain disruption, and\nsystemic changes to geographies, regional economies\nand sectors, and any resulting population migration or\nunemployment.\nTransition risks arise from the process of adjusting\nto a low-carbon economy. In addition to possible\nchanges in climate policy and financial regulation,\npotential transition risks may include economic and\nother changes engendered by the development of low-\ncarbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles\nand renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer\npreferences towards low-carbon goods and services.\nTransition risks could be further accelerated by the\noccurrence of changes in the physical climate. The\npossible adverse impacts of transition risks to both\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers include:\nsudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by\nchanges in climate policy and/or regulations\nnegative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including as\na result of any perception that its business practices\nare contrary to public policy or stakeholder\npreferences.\nBoth physical risks and transition risks could have\nnegative impacts on the revenues, financial condition\nor creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and\ncustomers, and on its exposure to those clients and\ncustomers.\n29",

All employees are expected to demonstrate\nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral\npart of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do\nBusiness Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s\ncommitment to “do first class business in a first\nclass way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct\nrisk management throughout an employee’s life cycle,\nincluding recruiting, onboarding, training and\ndevelopment, and performance management. Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral component of JPMorgan\nChase’s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in improper\nor illegal conduct in the past. These instances of\nmisconduct have resulted in litigation, and\nresolutions of governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred\nprosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and\nother civil or criminal sanctions. There is no\nassurance that further inappropriate or unlawful\nactions by employees will not occur, lead to a\nviolation of the terms of these resolutions (and\nassociated consequences), or that any such actions\nwill always be detected, deterred or prevented.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a failure\nby one or more employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations,\npolicies and practices, including by acting in ways\nthat harm clients, customers, other market\nparticipants or other employees. Some examples of this\ninclude:\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s\nproducts or services\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or\nunauthorized trading\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\nfacilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting\nor financial disclosure treatment that may be subject\nto scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities,\nor where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not\nreflect the economic substance of the transaction\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants\nusing electronic communications channels that have\nnot been approved by JPMorgan Chase\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering\na diverse and inclusive workplace\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance\ngoals or employee compensation objectives, and\nmisappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers\nor third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more\nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with\nJPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices\ncould include litigation, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nAny of these proceedings or actions could result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, or lead to:\nfinancial losses\nincreased operational and compliance costs\ngreater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\nregulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its\nactivities\nthe need for significant oversight by JPMorgan\nChase’s management\nloss of clients or customers, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect\nto newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails\nto successfully integrate employees of those\nbusinesses or any of those employees do not conduct\nthemselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's\nexpectations, policies and practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its\nbusinesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its\nability to attract and retain clients, customers,\ninvestors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation can therefore cause significant harm to\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects, and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, including:\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory\nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or actions that are contrary\nto JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and\ninclusive workplace\n30\nsecurity breaches, including as a result of cyber\nattacks\nfailure to safeguard client, customer or employee\ninformation\nfailure to manage risks associated with its business\nactivities or those of its clients, including those\nthat may be unpopular among one or more constituencies\nfailure to fully discharge publicly-announced\ncommitments to support social and sustainability\ninitiatives\nnon-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations\noperational failures\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nactions taken in executing regulatory and\ngovernmental requirements during a global or regional\nhealth emergency\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or\nresolutions of these matters, and\nfailure or perceived failure to comply with laws,\nrules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or other parties, including\nnewly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan\nChase has made principal investments, parties to joint\nventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which\nJPMorgan Chase does business.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly\ndamaged by adverse publicity or negative information\nregarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that\nmay be published or broadcast by the media or posted\non social media, non-mainstream news services or other\nparts of the internet. This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which\ninformation is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists are increasingly\ntargeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan\nChase with public criticism for their relationships\nwith clients that are engaged in certain sensitive\nindustries, including businesses whose products are or\nare perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose\nactivities negatively affect or are perceived to\nnegatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or\ncommunities. Activists have also engaged in public\nprotests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other\nproperties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s\nrelationships with clients in sensitive industries\ncould potentially engender dissatisfaction among\nclients, customers, investors and employees with how\nJPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability\nconcerns in its business activities. Alternatively,\nyielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive\nindustries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships\nwith clients and customers, and with governmental or\nregulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase does business, whose views are not aligned with\nthose of social and\nenvironmental activists. In either case, the resulting\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing\nbusiness with JPMorgan Chase\nimpair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new\nclients and customers, or to expand its relationships\nwith existing clients and customers\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain\nemployees\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with\ncertain clients or customers.\ncause certain investors to divest from investments\nin securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies.\nActions by the financial services industry generally\nor individuals in the industry can also affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged\nby concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial\ninstitution, or\na financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products to\ncustomers\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of\ninterest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as well\nas damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts\nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which encompass a variety\nof transactions, obligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan\nChase can become subject to litigation and enforcement\nactions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the\nfailure or perceived failure to:\nadequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts\nof interest that may arise in connection with\nproviding multiple products and services in, or having\none or more investments related to, the same\ntransaction\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\ntreat clients and customers with the appropriate\nstandard of care\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n31",

Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly involved in such a\nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any\noperations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well as in any nation\nthat is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and\naggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such\na conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts\nbusiness have economies or markets that are less\ndeveloped and more volatile or may have political,\nlegal and\nregulatory regimes that are less established or\npredictable than other countries in which JPMorgan\nChase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local\neconomy and business activity are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or control. Some of\nthese countries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth, and\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive\npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, such as:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of\ngovernment actions can negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations in the relevant country, either\ndirectly or by suppressing the business activities of\nlocal clients or multi-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\ncertain more developed countries, have been\nsusceptible to unfavorable social developments arising\nfrom poor economic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general\nstrikes\ncrime and corruption\nsecurity and personal safety issues\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities\noverthrow of incumbent governments\nterrorist attacks, and\nother forms of internal discord.\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in the\nfuture could lead to, conditions that can adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries\nand impair the revenues, growth and profitability of\nthose operations. In addition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations and investments in another country\nor countries, including in the U.S.\n32\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial services\nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented\nand diverse new employees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's\nefforts to retain talented and diverse employees can\nbe particularly challenging when members of its\nworkforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors.\nIf JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract\nor retain qualified and diverse employees, including\nsuccessors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of\nthe Operating Committee and other senior leaders,\nJPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its\ncompetitive position, could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the world.\nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S.\nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise\nmake it more difficult for employees or their family\nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between,\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations\nor conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees, and thereby dilute the quality of its\nworkforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make\nstructural changes to its worldwide or regional\noperating models that cause its operations to be less\nefficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise\ninvolved in many legal proceedings, including class\nactions and other litigation or disputes with third\nparties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan\nChase may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan\nChase. Any of these matters could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the financial\nservices industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase\nwill continue to experience a high level of litigation\nand regulatory and government investigations related\nto its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto\nheightened regulatory oversight. This heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nThere is no assurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other enforcement actions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law or regulation\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and officials in the\nU.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business activity\nor practice, this will often give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other governmental\nagencies of the same or similar activity or practice\nby JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to cease\noffering certain products or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation or lead to higher operational costs,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In addition, the\nextent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of reserves that\nJPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.\n33\nParts I and II",

There is no assurance that actual\nresults in 2022 will be in line with the outlook\ninformation set forth below, and the Firm does not\nundertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nJPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2022 should be\nviewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.\neconomies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets\nactivity, the geopolitical environment, the\ncompetitive environment, client and customer activity\nlevels, and regulatory and legislative developments in\nthe U.S. and other countries where the Firm does\nbusiness. Each of these factors will affect the\nperformance of the Firm and its LOBs.

The Firm continues to actively\nmonitor and adapt to health and safety developments at\nlocal and regional levels as more of its global\nworkforce returns to the office.\nFor information on the impact of U.S. government\nactions and programs in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, refer to:\nCredit Portfolio on page 109 for information on PPP,\nConsumer Credit Portfolio on page 112 and Wholesale\nCredit Portfolio on page 118 for information on\nretained loans under payment deferral, and\nNote 12 on page 231 for information on the Firm’s\nloan modification activities.\nInterbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition\nJPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue\nto make progress with respect to the transition from\nthe use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)\nand other IBORs to comply with the International\nOrganization of Securities Commission’s standards for\ntransaction-based benchmark rates. As of January 1,\n2022, ICE Benchmark Administration ceased the\npublication of all tenors of LIBOR for U.K. sterling,\nJapanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR\n(collectively, “non-U.S. dollar LIBOR”) and the one-\nweek and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The\ncessation of the publication of the principal tenors\nof U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month,\nthree-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) is\nscheduled for June 30, 2023.\nIn joint statements issued by the Federal Reserve, the\nOCC and the FDIC, the banking regulators encouraged\nU.S. banks to cease entering into new contracts that\nuse U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December\n31, 2021. The Firm has ceased executing contracts that\nreference U.S. dollar LIBOR, with certain permissible\nlimited exceptions, and now offers various floating\nrate products, and provides and arranges various types\nof floating rate debt financings, across its\nbusinesses that reference replacement rates, including\nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The\nFirm continues to engage with clients in relation to\nthe transition from the principal tenors of U.S.\ndollar LIBOR and to support clients as they move to\nreplacement rates.\nOn November 16, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority\n(“FCA”) confirmed that it will allow, for a period of\nat least one year, the use of “synthetic” U.K.\nsterling and Japanese yen LIBOR rates in all legacy\nLIBOR contracts, other than cleared derivatives, that\nhad not been transitioned to replacement rates by\nJanuary 1, 2022. The use of these synthetic LIBORs,\nwill allow market participants additional time to\ncomplete their transition to replacement rates or\notherwise to reduce their exposure to contracts that\ndo not have robust fallback mechanisms and that are\ndifficult to amend.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the principal\ncentral counterparties (“CCPs”) converted cleared\nderivatives contracts linked to non-U.S. dollar LIBOR\nto replacement rates before the cessation of the\npublication of those LIBORs on December 31, 2021.\nThe Firm has made significant progress towards\nreducing its exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts,\nincluding in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated\nloans, securities, and debt and preferred stock\nissuances, and is on-track to meet its internal\nmilestones for contract remediation as well as the\nindustry milestones and recommendations published by\nNational Working Groups, including the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee in the U.S.\nIn connection with the transition from LIBOR, as of\nDecember 31, 2021 the Firm had remediated\nsubstantially all of the notional amount of its\nbilateral derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and non-U.S. dollar\n50    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nLIBOR, and substantially all of its non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-linked loans. The Firm continues its client\noutreach with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked\nloans.\nThe Firm is also on schedule to implement further\nnecessary changes to risk management systems in order\nto transition from LIBOR, including modifications to\nits operational systems and models. In 2021, the Firm\nchanged the rate basis of its transfer pricing\nmethodology for U.S. dollar-denominated contracts to\nSOFR and implemented internal controls to restrict the\nuse of LIBOR in new transactions.\nLegislation intended to reduce the likelihood of\ndisputes arising from the cessation of LIBOR has been\nadopted or proposed in certain jurisdictions. The Firm\ncontinues to review the extent to which these\nlegislative actions or proposals, if enacted, may\nreduce the risk of litigation and disputes arising\nfrom the transition from LIBOR.\nThe Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client,\nindustry, market, regulatory and legislative\ndevelopments, including the transition relief issued\nby the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury\nDepartment in January 2022 with respect to the tax\nimplications of reference rate reform.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    51\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section provides a comparative discussion of\nJPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on\na reported basis for the two-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2021, unless otherwise specified.

Refer to Note 25 for further information. 2021 compared with 2020 Investment banking fees\nincreased across products in CIB, reflecting: • higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and wallet\nshare gains • higher equity underwriting fees due to a strong IPO market and wallet share gains , and • higher debt\nunderwriting fees predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition\nfinancing. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for additional information. Principal\ntransactions revenue decreased, reflecting: • lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily in Rates,\nCurrencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and Commodities, compared to a strong prior year, and an increase in\nSecuritized Products, and • lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity investments in Corporate, partially\noffset by • higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong performance across derivatives, prime brokerage,\nand Cash Equities\nfavorable results in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other, with a net gain of $250 million predominantly driven by\nvaluation adjustments related to derivatives, compared with a $29 million net loss in the prior year, and • the\nabsence of losses recorded in the prior year in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which\nwere more than offset by the related net interest income earned on these transactions, also in the prior year.\nRefer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 67-72 and pages 79-80, respectively, and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of: • higher cash management fees in CIB and\nCB, and higher lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees in CIB, predominantly offset by • lower\noverdraft fee revenue in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75,\nrespectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue\nincreased driven by: • higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a result of higher average market levels and\nnet inflows, and • higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily associated with higher assets under\ncustody. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and\nNote 6 for additional information. Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses related to\nrepositioning the investment securities portfolio, compared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE\nand government agency MBS. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for additional\ninformation. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to: • lower net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting\na net loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to prepayment\nexpectations, and • lower mortgage production revenue on lower production margins.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB\nseg ment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for further information.\nOther income decreased reflecting: • lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume,\nand • increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments in the tax-oriented investment\nportfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated\ntax credits, predominantly offset by • net gains on several investments, primarily in CIB and AWM, and • the\nabsence of losses recorded in the prior year related to the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term\ndebt in Treasury and CIO. Net interest income decreased driven by the impact of lower market rates and changes in\nthe balance sheet mix, partially offset by balance sheet growth. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were\n$3.2 trillion, up $436 billion, predominantly driven by higher deposits with banks and investment securities, and\nthe yield was 1.81%, down 53 basis points (“bps”).

The net\nbenefit in consumer was driven by: • a $9.5 billion\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses,\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic\noutlook, including $7.6 billion in Card, and $1.2\nbillion in Home Lending, which also reflects continued\nimprovements in Home Price Index (\"HPI\") expectations,\nand • lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as\nconsumer cash balances remained elevated; • the prior\nyear included a $7.4 billion net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses. The net benefit in\nwholesale was due to a net reduction of $2.6 billion\nin the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs,\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic\noutlook.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business\ndue to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and\nmarket conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources,\nand its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating\nliquidity needs. • In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts payable and other\nliabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities. • In 2020, cash used\nprimarily reflected higher trading assets, other assets, and securities borrowed, partially offset by higher\ntrading liabilities and net income excluding noncash adjustments.\nInvesting activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans\nand investing in the investment securities portfolio, and other short-term instruments. • In 2021, cash used\nresulted from net purchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans, partially offset by\nlower securities purchased under resale agreements. • In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of\ninvestment securities, higher net originations of loans, and higher securities purchased under resale agreements.\nFinancing activities The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt\nand preferred stock. • In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term\nborrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. • In 2020,\ncash provided reflected higher deposits and an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements,\npartially offset by net payments of long-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of\ncommon stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis\non pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for a further\ndiscussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    57\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE\nOF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 160-164. That\npresentation, which is referred to as “reported”\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results,\nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results\nof the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition\nof managed basis starts, in each case, with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments\nthat receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable\nto taxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense. These adjustments have no impact on net\nincome as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the\nLOBs.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment level\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the underlying\noperational performance and trends of the Firm or of\nthe particular business segment, as the case may be,\nand, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or\nthe business segment with the performance of its\nrelevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment\nResults on pages 61-80 for additional information on\nthese non-GAAP measures.

The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital required for\neach LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies\nand reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may be implemented\nin future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products\nand services to the Firm’s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share revenue from\nthose transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in\nthe segment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segment(s)\ninvolved in the transaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments\nrelated to corporate support units, technology and\noperations not currently utilized by any LOB, are not\nallocated to the business segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally\nincludes costs that would not be incurred if the\nsegments were stand-alone businesses; and other items\nnot aligned with a particular business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to each\nbusiness segment and transfers the primary interest\nrate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO\nwithin Corporate.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the business\nsegments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    61\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nAs a result of the current interest rate environment\nand the excess liquidity stemming from government and\ncentral bank actions since the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic, the cost of funds for assets and the credits\nearned for liabilities have generally declined,\nimpacting the business segments net interest income.\nAs such, during the period ended December 31, 2021,\nthis has resulted in lower cost of funds for loans and\nmargin compression on deposits across the LOBs.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost\nall of the cost of the credit spread component of\noutstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the reportable\nbusiness segments, while the balance of the cost is\nretained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the\ncost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with the\nrelevant regulatory capital requirements, as\napplicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term\ndebt is included in a business segment’s net interest\nincome, and net income is reduced\nby preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business\nsegment’s net income applicable to common equity.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nadditional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is\nreferred to as equity.The Firm’s allocation\nmethodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA,\nBasel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a\nsimulation of capital in a severe stress environment.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Firm has changed its line\nof business capital allocations primarily as a result\nof changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an\nincrease in the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that\nwill be effective January 1, 2023. The assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nperiodically reassessed and as a result, the capital\nallocated to the LOBs may change from time to time.\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for\nadditional information on capital allocation .\nSegment Results – Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…       Co…                                Co…\nm…       &                                    &                                Co…\ne…       Co…                                In…                                Ba…\nr…       Ba…  20…       20…       20…       Ba…  20…       20…       20…       20…        20…          20…\nT…\nn…    $       50…  $    51…  $    55…    $  51…       $    49…  $    39…    $  10…     $       9,…  $       9,…\nr…\nT…\nn…            29…       27…       28…       25…            23…       22…       4,…             3,…          3,…\ne…\nP…            20…       23…       26…       26…            25…       16…       5,…             5,…          5,…\np…\nP…\nf…            -6…       12…       4,…       -1…            2,…       277       -9…             2,…          296\nc…\nl…\nN…            20…       8,…       16…       21…            17…       11…       5,…             2,…          3,…\ni…\nR…\non            41%       15%       31%        25  %         20%       14%        21  %          11%          17%\ne…\n(…\nY…\ne…\nD…\n3…\n(…       As…\nm…         &\ne…       We…\nr…       Ma…  20…       20…       20…       Cor…  20…       2020       20…       Tot…  20…       2020       20…\nT…\nn…    $  16…       $    14…  $    13…    $        -3…  $    -1,…  $    1,…    $        12…  $    122…  $    11…\nr…\nT…\nn…       10…            9,…       9,…             1,…       1,3…       1,…             71…       66,…       65…\ne…\nP…       6,…            4,…       3,…             -5…       -2,…       144             53…       56,…       53…\np…\nP…\nf…       -2…            263        59              81         66        -1             -9…       17,…       5,…\nc…\nl…\nN…       4,…            2,…       2,…             -3…       -1,…       1,…             48…       29,…       36…\ni…\nR…\non        33  %         28%       26%              NM         NM        NM             19%        12%       15%\ne…\n(…\nThe following sections provide a comparative discussion of the Firm’s results by segment as of or for the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n62    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING\nConsumer & Community Banking offers services to\nconsumers and businesses through bank branches,\nATMs, digital (including mobile and online) and\ntelephone banking.

Refer to\nCritical Accounting Estimates on pages 150-153, and\nNote 6 for additional information on card income.\nNoninterest expense was $29.3 billion, up 5%,\nreflecting:\nincreased compensation expense, as well as\ninvestments in technology and marketing campaigns, and\ngrowth in travel-related benefits,\npartially offset by\nlower depreciation expense due to lower auto lease\nassets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral\nvalues.\nThe provision for credit losses was a net benefit of\n$7.0 billion, compared with an expense of $12.3\nbillion in the prior year, driven by:\na $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit\nlosses, reflecting improvements in the Firm’s\nmacroeconomic outlook, consisting of $7.6 billion in\nCard, $675 million in CBB, $300 million in Auto and\n$1.2 billion in Home Lending, which also reflects\ncontinued improvements in HPI expectations, and\nlower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as\nconsumer cash balances remained elevated.\nThe prior year included a $7.8 billion addition to the\nallowance for credit losses.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 106-132 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages\n129-131 for a further discussion of the credit\nportfolios and the allowance for credit losses.\n64    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except headcount)                           2021              2020              2019\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets                                $    500,370        $  496,705        $  541,367\nLoans:\nConsumer & Business Banking(a)                    35,095            48,810            29,585\nHome Lending(b)                                  180,529           182,121           213,445\nCard                                             154,296           144,216           168,924\nAuto                                              69,138            66,432            61,522\nTotal loans                                      439,058           441,579           473,476\nDeposits                                       1,148,110           958,706           723,418\nEquity                                            50,000            52,000            52,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets                                $    489,771        $  501,584        $  543,127\nLoans:\nConsumer & Business Banking                       44,906            43,064            28,859\nHome Lending(c)                                  181,049           197,148           230,662\nCard                                             140,405           146,633           156,325\nAuto                                              67,624            61,476            61,862\nTotal loans                                      433,984           448,321           477,708\nDeposits                                       1,054,956           851,390           698,378\nEquity                                            50,000            52,000            52,000\nHeadcount                                        128,863           122,894           125,756\n(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $5.4\nbillion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in\nBusiness Banking under the PPP.

The Firm\nranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,\naccording to Dealogic.\n– Advisory fees were $4.4 billion, up 85%, driven by\nincreased M&A activity and wallet share gains.\n– Equity underwriting fees were $4.0 billion, up 43%,\ndriven by a strong IPO market and wallet share gains.\n– Debt underwriting fees were $5.0 billion, up 15%,\npredominantly driven by an active leveraged loan\nmarket primarily related to acquisition financing.\nPayments revenue was $6.3 billion, up 13%, and\nincluded net gains on equity investments. Excluding\nthese net gains, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 5%,\ndriven by higher deposit balances and fees, largely\noffset by deposit margin compression.\nLending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 13%,\npredominantly driven by lower net interest income,\nlargely offset by lower fair value losses on hedges of\naccrual loans, and higher loan commitment fees.\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.0\nbillion, down 5%. Markets revenue was $27.4 billion,\ndown 7%.\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, down\n19%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies &\nEmerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing, Commodities\nand Credit compared to a strong prior year, partially\noffset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.\nEquity Markets revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22%,\ndriven by strong performance across prime brokerage,\nderivatives and Cash Equities.\nSecurities Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2%,\ndriven by growth in fees and deposits, predominantly\noffset by deposit margin compression.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $250\nmillion predominantly driven by valuation adjustments\nrelated to derivatives.\nNoninterest expense was $25.3 billion, up 8%,\npredominantly driven by higher compensation expense,\nincluding revenue-related compensation and\ninvestments, as well as higher volume-related\nbrokerage expense, partially offset by lower legal\nexpense.\nThe provision for credit losses was a net benefit of\n$1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses, compared with an expense\nof $2.7 billion in the prior year.\n68    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31, (in millions, except headcount)\n2021                                                            2020                    2019\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets(a)                                 $  1,259,896            $  1,095,926            $  913,803\nLoans:\nLoans retained(b)                                    159,786                 133,296               121,733\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                 50,386                  39,588                34,317\nvalue(c)\nTotal loans                                          210,172                 172,884               156,050\nEquity                                                83,000                  80,000                80,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets(a)                                 $  1,334,518            $  1,121,942            $  992,770\nTrading assets-debt and equity                       448,099                 425,060    -e         376,182\ninstruments\nTrading assets-derivative receivables                 68,203                  69,243    -e          48,196\nLoans:\nLoans retained(b)                                    145,137                 135,676               122,371\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair                 51,072                  33,792                32,884\nvalue(c)\nTotal loans                                          196,209                 169,468               155,255\nEquity                                                83,000                  80,000                80,000\nHeadcount(d)                                          67,546                  61,733                60,013\n(a) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation.

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.\nMarkets revenue consists of principal transactions,\nfees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets\nbusiness performance on a total revenue basis, as\noffsets may occur across revenue line items. For\nexample, securities that generate net interest income\nmay be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected\nat fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer\nto Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition\nof these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise\nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal\ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon\nexecuting new transactions with market participants,\nas well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is\nrevenue recognized from gains and losses on\nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to,\nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments used by the Firm to actively manage the\nrisk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new\ntransactions with market participants is affected by\nmany factors including the level of client activity,\nthe bid-offer spread (which is the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an instrument\nto the Firm and the price at which another market\nparticipant is willing and able to buy it from the\nFirm, and vice versa), market liquidity and\nvolatility. These factors are interrelated and\nsensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market\nconditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity\nprices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.\n70    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized\nupon executing new transactions.\nYe…\nen…\nDe…\n31,\n(in\nmi…\nex…       2021                                2020                                2019\nwh…       Fix…                                Fix…                                Fix…\not…       Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…\nno…       Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…\nPr…    $  7,9…    $  7,5…    $  15,…       $  11,…    $  6,0…    $  17,…       $  8,7…    $  5,7…    $  14,…\ntr…\nLe…\nand        321         17        338           226         10        236           198          7        205\nde…\nfe…\nAs…\nma…\nad…        545       1,9…       2,5…           411       2,0…       2,4…           407       1,7…       2,1…\nand\nco…\nAll\not…        972       -101        871           493        -62        431           872          8        880\nin…\nNo…       9,7…       9,4…       19,…          12,…       8,1…       21,…          10,…       7,5…       17,…\nre…\nNet\nin…       7,1…       1,1…       8,2…          7,8…        483       8,3…          4,1…       -1,…       3,1…\nin…\nTo…\nnet    $  16,…    $  10,…    $  27,…       $  20,…    $  8,6…    $  29,…       $  14,…    $  6,4…    $  20,…\nre…\nLo…                                   4                                   4                                   1\nda…\n(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets, posted losses to total net revenue.

Net revenue was $10.0 billion, up 7%. Net\ninterest income was $6.0 billion, down 3%, driven by the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits and a\ndecrease in loans, largely offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, up 28%,\npredominantly driven by higher investment banking and payments revenue. Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, up\n6%, predominantly driven by investments in the business, including higher compensation expense, and higher volume-\nand revenue-related expense. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $947 million, driven by a net\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses, compared with an expense of $2.1 billion in the prior year.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    73\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCB product revenue consists of the following:\nLendingincludes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily provided on a secured basis;\ncollateral includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.

Net revenue was $17.0 billion, an increase\nof 19%. Net interest income was $3.9 billion, up 14%. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, up 21%. Revenue from\nAsset Management was $9.2 billion, up 21%, predominantly driven by: • higher asset management fees, net of\nliquidity fee waivers, on higher average market levels and strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and\nliquidity products, • higher performance fees, and • higher net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Global\nPrivate Bank was $7.7 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by: • higher loans including the impact of lower\nfunding costs, and higher asset management fees, partially offset by • the net impact of margin compression on\nhigher deposits. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $227 million, driven by a reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses, compared with an expense of $263 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was\n$10.9 billion, up 10%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related compensation expense and distribution fees,\nhigher structural expense, and higher investments in the business, partially offset by lower legal expense.\n76    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nAsset Management has two high-level measures of\nits overall fund performance.\nEffective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer group quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper\nto Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, for which the source\nremains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund performance utilizing this peer group ranking\nand believes that it provides investors with comparability across the industry. This change resulted in both\npositive and negative impacts on the quartile rankings for prior periods, as compared to how they would have\nbeen ranked by Lipper. In addition, AWM has changed its selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-\nU.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent\napproach across these products. Prior periods in the following table have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star:Mutual fund rating services rank\nfunds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star\nrating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and\nrepresents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable)\nMorningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual\nshare\nclass level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer\nthan three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned\npeer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating\nprovider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary\nshare class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides\nratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management\nin funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one,\nthree and five years):\nAll quartile rankings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive\nthese rankings are sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based on the\nnet-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on fund performance and associated\npeer rankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class”\nlevel to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds.

Net revenue was a loss of $3.5 billion, compared with a loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year. Net interest\nincome decreased primarily driven by: • limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to significant deposit\ngrowth across the LOBs, and • the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities in the first half of\n2021, partially offset by • higher net interest income on growth in investment securities. Noninterest revenue\ndecreased primarily due t o: • net investment securities losses related to repositioning the investment securities\nportfolio, compared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS , • lower net\nvaluation gains on several legacy equity investments partially offset by • the absence of losses recorded in the\nprior year in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the related\nnet interest income earned on these transactions, also in the prior year, and • the absence of losses recorded in\nthe prior year related to the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO\nNoninterest expense of $1.8 billion was up $429 million primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm’s\nFoundation, investments related to the Firm’s international consumer expansion, technology initiatives, and higher\nlegal expense, largely offset by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment recorded in the prior year.\nRefer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance\nfor credit losses. The current period income tax benefit was driven by changes in the level and mix of income and\nexpenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as other tax adjustments, partially offset by\nthe resolutions of certain tax audits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    79\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nTreasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and\nmanaging the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks\nmanaged by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business\nsegments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and\nliabilities. Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by\ninvesting in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment\nsecurities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm ’ s asset-liability management\nobjectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manage the Firm’s\ncash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments.

R efer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 133-140 for informatio n on interest rate, foreign exchange and other risks. The\ninvestment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-\nbacked securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, other\nABS and corporate debt securities. At December 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net\nof allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings).

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in\na manner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors and protects the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data\nand management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;\nand\nFirmwide structures for risk governance.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal governance\nand independent oversight by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm’s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance and oversight framework\nThe Firm’s risk management governance and oversight\nframework involves understanding drivers of risks,\ntypes of risks, and impacts of risks.\nDrivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include the economic\nenvironment, regulatory and government policy,\ncompetitor and market evolution, business decisions,\nprocess and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\nTypes of Risks are categories by which risks manifest\nthemselves. Risks are generally categorized in the\nfollowing four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal\nor a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and\ninvestment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nOperational risk is the risk associated with an\nadverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human factors; or\nexternal events impacting the Firm’s processes or\nsystems. It includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk.\nImpacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings\nand capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation\ndamage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory\nand enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is\nmanaged on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an\nIndependent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which\nconsists of the Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\nappoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of\nthe Board (“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief\nRisk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM organization and\nmanage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The\nframework is subject to approval by the Board Risk\nCommittee in the form of the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and\ndelegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk\nExecutives (“FREs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance\nOfficer (“CCO”), who each establish Risk Management\nand Compliance organizations, set the Firm’s risk\ngovernance policies and standards, and define and\noversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk\ngovernance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks\nthat arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk\nareas that span across the individual LOBs, functions\nand regions.\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm relies upon each area of the Firm giving rise\nto risk to operate within the parameters identified by\nthe IRM function, and within its own management-\nidentified risk and control standards.\nEach LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned\nOperations, Technology and Control Management, are the\nFirm’s “first line of defense” and own the\nidentification of risks, as well as the design and\nexecution of controls to manage those risks. The first\nline of defense is responsible for adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and for the\nimplementation of the risk management structure (which\nmay include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and\ncontrols) established by IRM.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    81\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe IRM function is independent of the businesses and\nis the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM\nfunction independently assesses and challenges the\nfirst line of defense risk management practices. IRM\nis also responsible for its own adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and for the\nimplementation of policies and standards established\nby IRM with respect to its own processes.\nInternal Audit is an independent function that\nprovides objective assessment on the adequacy and\neffectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls,\ngovernance and risk management as the “third line of\ndefense.” The Internal Audit Function is headed by the\nGeneral Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee\nand administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute\nto the Firmwide control environment but are not\nconsidered part of a particular line of defense,\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal, and are\nresponsible for adherence to applicable laws, rules\nand regulations and policies and standards established\nby IRM with respect to their own processes.\nRisk identification and ownership\nEach LOB and Corporate owns the ongoing identification\nof risks, as well as the design and execution of\ncontrols, including IRM-specified controls, to manage\nthose risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a\nformal Risk Identification framework designed to\nfacilitate each LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to\nidentify material risks inherent to the Firm, catalog\nthem in a central repository and review the most\nmaterial risks on a regular basis. The IRM function\nreviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s\nidentified risks, maintains the central repository and\nprovides the consolidated Firmwide results to the\nFirmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk\nCommittee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by\n“Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and\nqualitative risks. Periodically the Firm’s risk\nappetite is set and approved by senior management\n(including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board\nRisk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are\nassessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to\ntake risk consistent with its stated risk appetite.\nRisk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\n82    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is\nsupported by a governance structure that provides for\nescalation of risk issues to senior management, the\nFRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the committees of the\nBoard of Directors and key senior management-level\ncommittees in the Firm’s risk governance structure. In\naddition, there are other committees, forums and paths\nof escalation that support the oversight of risk which\nare not shown in the chart below or described in this\nForm 10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the\nFirm’s CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the\nLOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to\nand may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors. The Operating Committee is responsible for\nescalating to the Board the information necessary to\nfacilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm. This includes\nmonitoring the Firm’s financial performance and\ncondition and reviewing the strategic objectives and\nplans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant\nportion of its oversight responsibilities through its\nindependent, principal standing committees. The Board\nRisk Committee is the principal committee that\noversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees\nthe control environment, and the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee oversees compensation\nand other management-related matters. Each committee\nof the Board oversees reputational risks and conduct\nrisks within its scope of responsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is\nresponsible for the oversight of management of the\nbank. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes\nthis function acting directly and through the\nprincipal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Risk Committee and the\nAudit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to\ncompensation and other management-related matters, the\nCompensation & Management Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its\noversight of management’s responsibility to implement\na global risk management framework reasonably designed\nto identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The\nBoard Risk Committee’s responsibilities include\napproval of applicable primary risk policies and\nreview of certain associated frameworks, analysis and\nreporting established by management. Breaches in risk\nappetite and parameters, issues that may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Firm, including capital\nand liquidity issues, and other significant risk-\nrelated matters are escalated to the Board Risk\nCommittee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight\nof management’s responsibility to ensure that there is\nan effective system of controls reasonably designed to\nsafeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the\nintegrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and\nmaintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and with laws and\nregulations. It also assists the Board in its\noversight of the Firm’s independent registered public\naccounting firm’s qualifications, independence and\nperformance, and of the performance of the Firm’s\nInternal Audit function.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    83\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee\n(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the\nFirm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC\nreviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and\nqualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the\nperformance of Operating Committee members against\ntheir goals, and approves their compensation awards.\nIn addition, the CEO’s award is subject to\nratification by the independent directors of the\nBoard. The CMDC also reviews the development of and\nsuccession for key executives. As part of the Board’s\nrole of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating\nthe “tone at the top”, the CMDC provides oversight of\nthe Firm’s culture, including reviewing updates from\nmanagement regarding significant conduct issues and\nany related actions with respect to employees,\nincluding compensation actions. The Public\nResponsibility Committee provides oversight and review\nof the Firm's positions and practices on public\nresponsibility matters such as community investment,\nfair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and\nother public policy issues that reflect the Firm's\nvalues and character and could impact the Firm's\nreputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also\nprovides guidance on these matters to management and\nthe Board, as appropriate. The Corporate Governance &\nNominating Committee exercises general oversight with\nrespect to the governance of the Board of Directors.\nIt reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the\nBoard of Directors proposed nominees for election to\nthe Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to\nthe Board corporate governance practices applicable to\nthe Firm. It also appraises the framework for\nassessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation.\nManagement oversight The Firm’s senior management-\nlevel committees that are primarily responsible for\nkey risk-related functions include: The Firmwide Risk\nCommittee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest management-\nlevel risk committee. It provides oversight of the\nrisks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as\nan escalation point for risk topics and issues raised\nby underlying committees and/or FRC members. The\nFirmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation\ncommittee for senior management to review and discuss\nthe Firmwide operational risk environment including\nidentified issues, operational risk metrics and\nsignificant events that have been escalated. Line of\nBusiness and Regional Risk Committees are responsible\nfor providing oversight of the governance, limits, and\ncontrols that are in place within the scope of their\nrespective activities. These committees review the\nways in which the particular LOB or the business\noperating in a particular region could be exposed to\nadverse outcomes with a focus on identifying,\naccepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of\nmatters brought to these committees.\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the operational risk and control\nenvironment of their respective business or function,\ninclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct\nRisks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible\nfor reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks\nand other data that may impact the level of operating\nrisk in a business or function, addressing key\noperational risk issues , with an emphasis on\nprocesses with control concerns and overseeing control\nremediation. The Asset and Liability Committee\n(“ALCO”) is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\nasset and liability management (“ALM”), including the\nactivities and frameworks supporting the management of\nliquidity risk, balance sheet, interest rate risk, and\ncapital risk. The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum\n(“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk\nexecutives and is responsible for overseeing the\nmanagement of risks arising from valuation activities\nconducted across the Firm. Risk governance and\noversight functions The Firm manages its risk through\nrisk governance and oversight functions. The scope of\na particular function may include one or more drivers,\ntypes and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country\nRisk Management oversees country risk which may be a\ndriver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that\ncould give rise to multiple risk types such as credit\nor market risk.

Strategic\nrisks are overseen by IRM through participation in\nrelevant business reviews, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement meetings, risk and control committees and\nother relevant governance forums and ongoing\ndiscussions. The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk\nCommittee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management\nframework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and\nstrategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement identify the associated risks that are\nincorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification\nprocess and their impact on risk appetite.\nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of\nthe LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess\ntheir impact on the risk profile of the Firm.\nThe Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes\nthe development and execution of strategic\ninitiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s\nstrategic risk. Guided by the Firm’s How We Do\nBusiness Principles (the “Principles”) , the Operating\nCommittee and senior management teams in each LOB and\nCorporate review and update the strategic plan\nperiodically. The process includes evaluating the\nhigh-level strategic framework and performance against\nprior-year initiatives, assessing the operating\nenvironment, refining existing strategies and\ndeveloping new strategies.\nThese strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s\nassessment, are incorporated in the Firm’s budget and\nprovided to the Board as part of its review and\napproval of the Firm’s strategic plan.\nThe Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on\nrisk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust\nliquidity, is also a component in the management of\nstrategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 for further information on capital risk.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for\nfurther information on liquidity risk. Refer to\nReputation Risk Management on page 105 for further\ninformation on reputation risk.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    85\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCapital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient\nlevel or composition of capital to support the Firm’s\nbusiness activities and associated risks during normal\neconomic environments and under stressed conditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s\nbusiness strategy and competitive position.\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through\neconomic volatility is considered a strategic\nimperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and\nOperating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet\nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong\ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk\nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-term\nstability to enable the Firm to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly\nstressed environments. Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm’s capital prior to making\nsignificant decisions that could impact future\nbusiness activities. In addition to considering the\nFirm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates\nall sources and uses of capital with a view to\nensuring the Firm’s capital strength.\nCapital management oversight\nThe Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function\nwhose primary objective is to provide independent\noversight of capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Management Oversight’s responsibilities\ninclude:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital\nrisk limits and indicators, including capital risk\nappetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report\ncapital limit breaches;\nPerforming an assessment of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement activities, including changes made to the\nContingency Capital Plan described below; and\nConducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory\ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance with\napplicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to\nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the\ncycle and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future\ninvestment opportunities;\nPromote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of\nstrength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its insured\ndepository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all\ntimes under applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate\nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with the\nFirm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements\nand maintaining a strong capital governance framework.\nThe internal minimum capital levels consider the\nFirm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an\ninternal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal\neconomic cycles and in stress events;\nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range\nof potential events; and\nRegular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position\nand following prescribed escalation protocols, both at\nthe Firm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\ncapital management include the Capital Governance\nCommittee, the ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs,\nand the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk\nCommittee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk\ntolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages\n81-84 for additional discussion on the ALCO and other\nrisk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding\nCompanies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at\nleast annually a capital plan that has been reviewed\nand approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal\nReserve uses CCAR and other stress testing processes\nto ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital\nduring periods of economic and financial stress, and\nhave robust, forward-looking capital assessment and\nplanning processes in place that address each BHC’s\nunique risks to enable it to absorb losses under\ncertain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal\nReserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and\ninternal capital adequacy assessment processes\n(“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital\ndistributions, such as dividend payments or stock\nrepurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under\nthe severely adverse scenario from its supervisory\nstress test to determine each firm’s Stress Capital\nBuffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year.\nOn June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had\ncompleted the 2021 CCAR stress test process. On August\n5, 2021, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2021\nSCB requirement of 3.2% (down from 3.3%) and the\nFirm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement\nincluding regulatory buffers, of 11.2% (down from\n11.3%). The 2021 SCB requirement became effective on\nOctober 1, 2021 and will remain in effect until\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n86    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nRefer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on\nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors\nfollowing the 2021 CCAR results.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs\nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of\nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses\nof capital as well as compliance with supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing\nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving\nthe capital stress testing control framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and\nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined\ncentrally and applied uniformly across the businesses.\nThese scenarios are articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of\nbusiness results; global market shocks, which generate\nshort-term but severe trading losses; and\nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios\nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition\nto CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management\nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and\nsensitivity analyses, as necessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s\napproach towards capital management in normal economic\nconditions and during stress. The Contingency Capital\nPlan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted\ncapital levels and meets minimum capital requirements,\nmonitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned\ncapital distributions, and sets out the capital\ncontingency actions that are expected to be taken or\nconsidered at various levels of capital depletion\nduring a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC\nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital\nrequirements generally follow the Capital Accord of\nthe Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards\nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and\nbanks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount\nof regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating risk-weighted\nassets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The\nFirm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are\ncurrently more binding than the Basel III Advanced\nrisk-based ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for\ncalculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and\nin the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk\nRWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk\nRWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches\nare that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is\nbased on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely\non the use of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-weightings which\nvary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a generally\nconsistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated\nunder these approaches, the Firm may supplement such\namounts to incorporate management judgment and\nfeedback from its regulators.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\nto calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more\nbinding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based\nratios. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional\ninformation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Firm has been impacted by market events as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained\nwell-capitalized.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nCECL regulatory capital transition. The Firm elected\nto apply the CECL capital transition provisions as\npermitted by the federal banking agencies which\ndelayed the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for\ntwo years until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-\nyear transition period (“CECL capital transition\nprovisions”).\nAs of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the\nFirm reflected the benefit of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions of $2.9 billion, which will be\nphased in at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022.\nThe CECL capital transition provisions have also been\nincorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average\nassets, and total leverage exposure and are also\nsubject to the three-year transition period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL\naccounting guidance.\nPaycheck Protection Program. The federal banking\nagencies issued a final rule in September 2020 to\nneutralize the regulatory capital effects of\nparticipating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios\nby applying a zero percent risk weight to loans\noriginated under the program. The Firm does not\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    87\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nexpect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans\nbecause the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Firm had $6.7 billion of loans\nremaining under the program.\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of calculating\nthe SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not\nparticipate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck\nProtection Program Lending Facility, which would have\nallowed the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.\nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations, such as the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expanded the\nscope of the prior capital deductions rule relating to\nthe holdings of capital instruments of financial\ninstitutions to also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important banking\norganizations. The final rule became effective April\n1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the\nFirm’s risk-based capital metrics.\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk .\nIn November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted\na rule implementing “Standardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced\nthe current exposure method used to measure\nderivatives counterparty exposure under Standardized\napproach RWA, as well as leverage exposure used to\ncalculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework.\nThe rule applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., with a mandatory compliance date of\nJanuary 1, 2022.\nBased on the derivatives exposure as of December 31,\n2021, the adoption of SA-CCR is estimated to increase\nthe Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40\nbillion and result in a modest decrease in its total\nleverage exposure. These estimates may differ from the\nactual impact based on the composition of the Firm’s\nderivatives exposure as of March 31, 2022.\n88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1\ncapital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are\nrequired to hold additional levels of capital to serve\nas a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital\nconservation buffer incorporates a global systemically\nimportant bank (“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory\ncapital requirements and a variable SCB requirement,\nfloored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital\nrequirements.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject\nto the higher of the two. “Method 1”, reflects the\nGSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s\nassessment methodology, and is calculated by the\nFinancial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five\ncriteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.\n“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the\nMethod 1 requirements to include a measure of short-\nterm wholesale funding in place of substitutability,\nand introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    89\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB\nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020. For 2022, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge\nunder both Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at\n2.0% and 3.5%, respectively.\n2022         2021         2020\nMethod 1    2.0     %    2.0     %    2.5     %\nMethod 2    3.5     %    3.5     %    3.5     %\nOn November 23, 2021, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2020, which\nannounced the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%) effective January 1, 2023, unless the Firm’s\nMethod 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2021. The Firm’s\nMethod 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2020 is 4.0%, which will be effective January 1, 2023.\nThe Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based\non the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on\nJanuary 1, 2024 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB surcharge calculation based upon data as of December 31, 2022 is\nlower. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally\nactive banks function. As of December 31, 2021, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal\nReserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve,\nFDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional\n2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in\nexcess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB\nsurcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may\ndistribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary\nbonus payments. The Firm believes that it will operate with a Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio between\n12.0% and 13.0% in the near term, based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect, and with consideration\nfor an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2023. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule\nrequires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC\nand eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional information.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to the\nBasel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1\ncapital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by\ntaking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital,\nand adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future\nexposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations\non the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as\nwell as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the\ncapital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the\nPrompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note\n27 for additional information. Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S.\nfederal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27.

The CFP also identifies the\nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. Liquidity Coverage Ratio and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet its estimated total net cash\noutflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of\nsignificant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered\nHQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations\nas defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-\nbank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows\nare based on standardized stress outflow and inflow\nrates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds,\nand obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum\nof 100%.\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months\nended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the Firm’s interpretation\nof the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                    Three months ended                                  December 31,\n(in millions)                      December 31, 2021        September 30, 2021                2020\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)               $             703,384     $             690,013     $       455,612\nEligible securities(b)(c)                     34,738                    34,049             241,447\nTotal HQLA(d)                  $             738,122     $             724,062     $       697,059\nNet cash outflows              $             664,801     $             645,557     $       634,037\nLCR                                              111  %                    112  %              110  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              73,321     $              78,505     $        63,022\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR                                              178  %                    174  %              160  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA       $             555,300     $             516,374     $       401,903\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during\nthe three months ended December 31, 2021, compared\nwith the prior year period primarily due to long-term\ndebt issuances. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average\nLCR increased during the three months ended December\n31, 2021, compared with both the three month periods\nended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nprimarily due to growth in deposits. The increase in\nexcess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is\nexcluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR\nrule. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average\nLCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes\nin its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows\nas a result of ongoing business activity.

This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $914\nbillion and $740 billion as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity\nthat could be raised at any particular time would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair\nvalue increased compared to December 31, 2020, due to\nan increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased\ndeposits.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nFHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve\nBank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to\nsuch banks of approximately $308 billion and $307\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that\nare currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window and other central banks. Although\navailable, the Firm does not view this borrowing\ncapacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window\nand the other central banks as a primary source of\nliquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” and\n“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year\nhorizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large\nbanking organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. are required to maintain an NSFR of\nat least 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule\nbecame effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its quarterly average\nNSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,\nbased on the Firm’s current understanding of the final\nrule.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    99\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including stable deposits,\nsecured and unsecured funding in the capital markets\nand stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary\nfunding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access\nfunding through short- or long-term secured\nborrowings, through the issuance of unsecured\nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The\nFirm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from\nlong-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured\nborrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on\noff–balance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,                                         Average\n(in millions)                                       2021            2020            2021            2020\nConsumer & Community Banking                $  1,148,110    $    958,706    $  1,054,956    $    851,390\nCorporate & Investment Bank                      707,791         702,215         760,048         655,095\nCommercial Banking                               323,954         284,263         301,343         237,645\nAsset & Wealth Management                        282,052         198,755         230,296         161,955\nCorporate                                            396             318             511             666\nTotal Firm                                  $  2,462,303    $  2,144,257    $  2,347,154    $  1,906,751\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce\nthe Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.\nA significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are\nconsumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,\nwhich are both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm. Furthermore,\ncertain deposits are covered by insurance protection\nthat provides additional funding stability and results\nin a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection\nmay be available to depositors in the countries in\nwhich the deposits are placed. For example, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)\nprovides deposit insurance protection for deposits\nplaced in a U.S. Depository Institution. At December\n31, 2021 and 2020, the Firmwide estimated uninsured\ndeposits were $1,489.6 billion and $1,275.9 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating\ndeposits.\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits. The\ntable below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and\nnon-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S.\ntime deposits are based on data that the Firm\ncalculates periodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations.

Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase decreased at December 31,\n2021, compared with December 31, 2020, due to lower\nsecured financing of AFS investment securities in\nTreasury and CIO, and trading assets in CIB Markets.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds. The increase in\ncommercial paper at December 31, 2021, from December\n31, 2020 was due to higher net issuance primarily for\nshort-term liquidity management.\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at\nDecember 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020, and for the\naverage year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the\nprior year period, was primarily due to net issuances\nof structured notes.\n102    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nLong-term funding and issuance\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market\naccess and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating\nits optimal long-term funding plan.\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its\nliquidity risk and stress testing metrics.

The Firm provides credit to a variety of\ncustomers, ranging from large corporate and\ninstitutional clients to individual consumers and\nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm\nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home\nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with\nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through\nits operating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages\ncredit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk\nmanagement governance includes the following\nactivities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including transaction\nand exposure approval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting\nguidelines\nAssigning and managing credit authorities in\nconnection with the approval of credit exposure\nManaging criticized exposures and delinquent loans,\nand\nEstimating credit losses and supporting appropriate\ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor\nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring\ncredit risk vary depending on several factors,\nincluding type of asset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g.,\ndelinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk management and\ncollection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of\nan obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm\nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses\nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and\nthe allowance for investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and\nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on\npages 150-153 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital\nand represent the potential volatility of actual\nlosses relative to the established allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The analyses\nfor these losses include stress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined\ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic\nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress\ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional\nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry\nand country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary.\nThe Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on\nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as\nwell as to assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of\nthe approval and decision-making process for extending\ncredit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately,\napproved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval\nauthorities, concentration limits, risk-rating\nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In\naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used\nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and\nother trends, including any concentrations at the\nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be\naddressed through changes in underwriting policies and\nportfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends against\nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and trends are\nincorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer\ncredit losses and are part of the monitoring of the\ncredit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client\nand counterparty level with established concentration\nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as\ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure\nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk\nthat exposure to a counterparty is positively\ncorrelated with the impact of a default by the same\ncounterparty, which could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to\nmeet its obligations is decreasing.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval processes\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent\nCredit Review function is responsible for:\nI ndependently validating or changing the risk\ngrades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk\ngrade changes initiated by responsible business units;\nand\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper\nmonitoring and management of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading policies and\nunderwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio\nreporting of industry, clients, counterparties and\ncustomers, product and geography are prepared, and the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly\nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance\nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are\nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk\ncommittees, senior management and the Board of\nDirectors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    107\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, there were\napproximately $386 million of new enrollments in\nconsumer payment deferral programs. Predominantly all\nborrowers that exited payment deferral programs are\ncurrent. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk\nassociated with loans subject to payment deferrals\nthroughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis\nafter the borrowers are required to resume making\nregularly scheduled payments, and considers expected\nlosses of principal and accrued interest on these loans\nin its allowance for credit losses.\nOf the $1.3 billion of retained loans under payment\ndeferral programs as of December 31, 2021,\napproximately $611 million were accounted for as TDRs\nprior to payment deferral and approximately $40 million\nwere accounted for as TDRs because they did not qualify\nfor or the Firm did not elect to suspend TDR accounting\nguidance under the option provided by the CARES Act, as\nextended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act and\nwhich expired on January 1, 2022. Borrowers that are\nunable to resume or continue making payments in\naccordance with the original or modified contractual\nterms of their agreements upon exit from deferral\nprograms will be placed on nonaccrual status in line\nwith the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit\ncards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and the\nloans charged off or down in accordance with the Firm’s\ncharge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies.\n112    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nConsumer, excluding credit card\nPortfolio analysis\nLoans increased from December 31, 2020 driven by\nhigher residential real estate loans at fair value,\nlargely offset by lower auto and other loans. The\nfollowing discussions provide information concerning\nindividual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation about this portfolio, including\ninformation about delinquencies, loan modifications\nand other credit quality indicators. Residential real\nestate: The residential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans were\nrelatively flat compared to December 31, 2020 as the\ndecline in Home Lending driven by paydowns outpacing\noriginations of prime mortgage loans was predominantly\noffset by growth in AWM. Retained nonaccrual loans\ndecreased from December 31, 2020 reflecting improved\ncredit performance. Net recoveries for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 were higher when compared with the\nprior year as the current year benefited from further\nimprovement in HPI and higher reversals of prior\nwrite-downs due to prepayments as a result of the low\nrate environment. Loans at fair value increased from\nDecember 31, 2020, reflecting loan purchase activity\nin CIB driven by higher client demand, as well as\nincreased originations in Home Lending due to the\ncontinued low rate environment. Nonaccrual loans at\nfair value decreased from December 31, 2020 due to\nsales in CIB. The carrying value of home equity lines\nof credit outstanding was $18.7 billion at December\n31, 2021. This amount included $6.2 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to fully\namortizing payments or have been modified and $6.0\nbillion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which\nprimarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk\nof HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or\nreducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk profile. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans were $30.0\nbillion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The\ninterest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio\nreflected net recoveries for the year ended December\n31, 2021, in line with the performance of the broader\nprime mortgage portfolio.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm\nmonitors its exposure to certain potential\nunrecoverable claim payments related to government-\ninsured loans and considers this exposure in\nestimating the allowance for loan losses.\n(in millions)                                  December 31, 2021            December 31, 2020\nCurrent                              $    689                     $    669\n30-89 days past due                       135                          235\n90 or more days past due                  623                          874\nTotal government guaranteed loans    $  1,447                     $  1,778\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-to-\nvalue ratio of residential real estate loans At\nDecember 31, 2021, $145.5 billion, or 65% of the total\nretained residential real estate loan portfolio,\nexcluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies, were concentrated in California, New York,\nFlorida, Texas and Illinois, compared with $146.6\nbillion, or 65% at December 31, 2020.

Auto and other : The auto and other loan\nportfolio, including loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto\nand business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The\nportfolio decreased when compared with December 31,\n2020 due to a decrease in business banking loans\nlargely offset by growth in the scored auto portfolio.\nBusiness Banking loans declined predominantly due to\nPPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by\noriginations. The increase in the scored auto\nportfolio was driven by loan originations\npredominantly offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 decreased when\ncompared to the prior year driven by lower scored auto\ncharge-offs as the current year benefited from higher\nvehicle collateral values and elevated consumer cash\nbalances, partially offset by higher overdraft charge-\noffs.

The December 31, 2021 30+\nand 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%,\nrespectively, decreased compared to the December 31,\n2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and\n0.92%, respectively. The delinquency rates continue to\nbenefit from the ongoing impact of government stimulus\nand support provided to borrowers who participated in\npayment assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the\nprior year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher\nrecoveries as consumer cash balances remained\nelevated.\nConsistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until charged\noff. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nincludes the estimated uncollectible portion of\naccrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to\nNote 12 for further information about this portfolio,\nincluding information about delinquencies.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2021, $70.5 billion, or 46% of the\ntotal retained credit card loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida\nand Illinois, compared with $65.0 billion, or 45%, at\nDecember 31, 2020. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the geographic and FICO composition of\nthe Firm’s credit card loans.\nModifications of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.0 billion of\ncredit card loans outstanding that have been modified\nin TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term\nor other insignificant modifications that are not\nconsidered TDRs, compared to $1.4 billion at December\n31, 2020. Refer to Note 12 for additional information\nabout loan modification programs to borrowers.\n116    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating\nservices (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with\nbanks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.\nRefer to the industry discussion on pages 119-123 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio\nincludes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including\nbusiness banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for credit losses. In 2021 the credit environment continued to improve following the broad-based\ndeterioration during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, retained loans increased\n$45.4 billion driven by CIB and AWM, partially offset by decreases in CCB. Lending-related commitments increased\n$36.6 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity in CB and CIB, including an increase in held for sale\ncommitments intended to be syndicated. As of December 31, 2021, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio\nremained relatively flat at 71%, while criticized exposure decreased $3.4 billion from $41.6 billion to $38.2\nbillion. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades,\nprimarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Nonperforming exposure\ndecreased $1.2 billion driven by lower nonperforming loans, primarily in Oil & Gas and Individuals and Individual\nEntities, with net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific downgrades.\nThe decrease in nonperforming loans was partially offset by increases in derivatives and lending-related\ncommitments.\nWholesale credit\nportfolio\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)            Credit exposure                                     Nonperforming(d)\n2021                                2020                          2021                   2020\nLoans retained        $          560,354      $    514,947                $             2,054      $  3,318\nLoans                              7,401             5,784                                 48           284\nheld-for-sale\nLoans at fair                     32,357            29,327                                343           504\nvalue\nLoans                            600,112           550,058                              2,445         4,106\nDerivative                        57,081            75,444        -c                      316            56\nreceivables\nReceivables from                  59,645            47,710                                  —             —\ncustomers(a)\nTotal wholesale\ncredit-related                   716,838           673,212                              2,761         4,162\nassets\nAssets acquired in\nloan satisfactions\nReal estate owned                         NA                NA                            101           125\nOther                                     NA                NA                              —             —\nTotalassets\nacquired in loan                          NA                NA                            101           125\nsatisfactions\nLending-related                  486,445           449,863                                764           577\ncommitments\nTotal wholesale       $        1,203,283      $  1,123,075                $             3,626      $  4,864\ncredit portfolio\nCredit derivatives\nand credit-related\nnotes used in         $          -20,190      $    -23,218        -c      $                 —      $      —\ncredit portfolio\nmanagement\nactivities(b)\nLiquid securities\nand other cash\ncollateral held                  -10,102           -14,806                                     NA            NA\nagainst\nderivatives\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB,\nCCB and AWM; these are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

(d)\nLoans that were modified in response to the COVID-19\npandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with\nthe Firm’s overall credit risk management framework.\nAs of December 31, 2021 , predominantly all of these\nloans were considered performing.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    117\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nWholesale assistance\nIn March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to\nclients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\npredominantly in the form of payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had\napproximately $107 million and $1.6 billion,\nrespectively, of retained loans under payment deferral\nprograms, compared to $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020.\nPredominantly all clients that exited deferral are\ncurrent or have paid down their loans. The Firm\ncontinues to monitor the credit risk associated with\nloans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral\nperiod and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are\nrequired to resume making regularly scheduled\npayments, and considers expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest on these loans in its\nallowance for credit losses.\nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form\nof covenant modifications. These types of assistance,\nboth payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are\ngenerally not reported as TDRs, either because the\nmodifications were insignificant or they qualified to\nsuspend TDR accounting guidance under the option\nprovided by the CARES Act, as extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act and which expired on\nJanuary 1, 2022. Loans under assistance continue to be\nrisk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall\ncredit risk management framework.

Predominantly all of the\ncredit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management\nactivities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection\nagainst certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.\n(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally\nbased on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31,\n2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.\nWholesale credit exposure – industry exposures\nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification\nof its industry exposures, and pays particular\nattention to industries with actual or potential\ncredit concerns.\nExposures deemed criticized align with the U.S.\nbanking regulators’ definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of the special mention,\nsubstandard and doubtful\ncategories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $38.2\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and $41.6 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020, representing approximately 3.5% and\n4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively.\nThe decrease in criticized exposure was driven by net\nportfolio activity and client-specific upgrades,\nprimarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive, largely offset\nby client-specific downgrades. The $38.2 billion of\ncriticized exposure at December 31, 2021 was largely\nundrawn and $35.0 billion was performing.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    119\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The contractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum possible credit risk\nshould the clients draw down on these commitments or\nwhen the Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or\nexpired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that\nthe total contractual amount of these wholesale\nlending-related commitments is representative of the\nFirm’s expected future credit exposure or funding\nrequirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information\non wholesale lending-related commitments. Receivables\nfrom customers Receivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients\nin CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage\nits credit risk the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required margin levels\non an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit\nadditional cash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These receivables are\nreported within accrued interest and accounts\nreceivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk including credit risk\nand risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities prices.\nThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to\nwhich the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the\nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),\nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also\nbe exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP.\nWhere possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit\nrisk exposures arising from derivative contracts\nthrough the use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage\nof the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to\ncollateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled\ndaily — was approximately 88% at both December 31,\n2021 and 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral\nagreements. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion\nof derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement\ntypes. The fair value of derivative receivables\nreported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $57.1\nbillion and $75.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven\nby market movements and maturities of certain trades\nin CIB, partially offset by an increase in commodity\nderivatives. Derivative receivables represent the fair\nvalue of the derivative contracts after giving effect\nto legally enforceable master netting agreements and\nthe related cash collateral held by the Firm. In\naddition, the Firm held liquid securities and other\ncash collateral that the Firm believes is legally\nenforceable and may be used as security when the fair\nvalue of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.\nFor these purposes, the definition of liquid\nsecurities is consistent with the definition of high\nquality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In\nmanagement’s view, the appropriate measure of current\ncredit risk should also take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents securities that\ndo not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the\nLCR rule, but that the Firm believes is legally\nenforceable. The collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are limited to the net derivative\nreceivables for the counterparty. The Firm also holds\nadditional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government\nsecurities, other liquid government agency and\nguaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity\nsecurities) delivered by clients at the initiation of\ntransactions, as well as collateral related to\ncontracts that have a non-daily call frequency and\ncollateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has\nnot yet settled as of the reporting date. Although\nthis collateral does not reduce the balances and is\nnot included in the tables below, it is available as\nsecurity against potential exposure that could arise\nshould the fair value of the client’s derivative\ncontracts move in the Firm’s favor.

To capture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates,\non a client-by-client basis, three measures of\npotential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak,\nDerivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average\nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level\nover the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used\nas an input for aggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value\nof the Firm’s derivative exposure, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG\nover the total life of the derivative contract is used\nas the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used\nto calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further\ndescribed below.\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in\nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the\ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In\naddition, the Firm’s risk\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-way\nrisk, which is broadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is positively correlated\nwith the impact of a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase at the same\ntime as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its\nobligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence\nthe nature and magnitude of these correlations over\ntime. To the extent that these correlations are\nidentified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated\nwith a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk\nmanages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into\ncredit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate,\nforeign exchange, equity and commodity derivative\ncontracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s\ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years\nas calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The\nthree measures generally show that exposure will\ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    127\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-\nmaker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit\nportfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate\nthe credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management\nactivities”).

This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between\nloans and lending-related commitments and the credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility that is not\nrepresentative, in the Firm’s view, of the true\nchanges in value of the Firm’s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps\n(“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may\nvary depending on a number of factors, including the\nnamed reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience\nlosses on specific exposures that are different than\nthe named reference entities in the purchased CDS);\nthe contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a\ndefined credit event that does not align with an\nactual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of\nthe Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be\nshorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm\ngenerally seeks to purchase credit protection with a\nmaturity date that is the same or similar to the\nmaturity date of the exposure for which the protection\nwas purchased, and remaining differences in maturity\nare actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

The Firm’s\nallowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance\nfor loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the\nallowance for lending-related commitments, which is\npresented on the Consolidated balance sheets in\naccounts payable and other liabilities, and • the\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities,\nwhich is recognized within Investment Securities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was $18.7 billion, a decrease from\n$30.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease in\nthe allowance for credit losses was primarily driven\nby improvements in the macroeconomic environment,\nconsisting of: • a $9.5 billion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card portfolio; and • a\n$2.6 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the\nLOBs. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is\nestimated using a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31,\n2021, the Firm assigned more balanced weightings to\nboth its adverse and upside scenarios compared to the\nsignificant weighting that the Firm placed on its\nadverse scenarios as of December 31, 2020, reflecting\nthe sustained improvement and resilience of the\nmacroeconomic environment, despite the ongoing impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, because the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental\nactions taken in response to the pandemic caused a\ndislocation in certain historical relationships used\nfor modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues\nto place reliance on management judgment and make\nadjustments specific to that dislocation, although to\na lesser extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit\nlosses of $18.7 billion reflects remaining\nuncertainties, including the potential impact that\nadditional waves or variants of COVID-19 may have on\nthe pace of economic growth and near-term supply chain\ndisruptions.\nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and year over year growth in U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22       4Q22       2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21       4Q21       2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 9.2  %     3.5  %     3.9  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December 31,\n2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was\n$670.1 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages\n79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the\ninvestment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings.

Refer to Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 97-104 for further information on\nrelated liquidity risk. Governance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s\nRisk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk\nCommittee with regular updates to the Board Risk\nCommittee. The Firm’s independent control functions\nare responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of\nthe carrying value of investment securities in\naccordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for\ninvestment securities are established for each risk\ncategory, including capital and credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The Firm’s investments will continue to evo\nlve in line with its strategies, including the Firm’s\ncommitment to support underserved communities and\nminority-owned businesses. The aggregate carrying\nvalues of the principal investment portfolios have not\nbeen significantly affected by the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

Governance and oversight The\nFirm’s approach to managing principal risk is\nconsistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.\nA Firmwide risk policy framework exists for all\nprincipal investing activities and includes approval\nby executives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate. The Firm’s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investments\nin accordance with relevant policies. As part of the\nrisk governance structure, approved levels for\ninvestments are established and monitored for each\nrelevant business or segment in order to manage the\noverall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts\nstress testing on these portfolios using specific\nscenarios that estimate losses based on significant\nmarket moves and/or other risk events.\n132    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of\nassets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies\nand procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators.

In setting limits,\nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration\nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity,\naccommodation of client business, and management\njudgment. Market Risk Management maintains different\nlevels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and\nstress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented\nby certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit\nand loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis.\nLimits that have not been reviewed within specified\ntime periods by Market Risk Management are reported to\nsenior management. The LOBs and Corporate are\nresponsible for adhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely\nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In the event of a\nbreach, Market Risk Management consults with senior\nmembers of appropriate groups within the Firm to\ndetermine the suitable course of action required to\nreturn the applicable positions to compliance, which\nmay include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the\nbreach or granting a temporary increase in limits to\naccommodate an expected increase in client activity\nand/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or\nLOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nMarket Risk Management continues to actively monitor\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk\nexposures by leveraging existing risk measures and\ncontrols.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur. For additional discussion on\nmodel uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 149.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    133\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions\nwhich give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous\n12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are representative\nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the\nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that\nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made\nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification\nacross product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results\nare reported to senior management, the Board of\nDirectors and regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market\nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product\ntypes. To capture material market risks as part of the\nFirm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses\nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR\nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk\nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as\nsensitivities and historical time series used to\ngenerate daily market values may be different across\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR\nmodel results across all portfolios are aggregated at\nthe Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time horizons, and\nother factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict\nlosses, particularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm\nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It\nis likely that using an actual price-based time series\nfor these products, if available, would affect the VaR\nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its\nmarket risk positions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be\ndifferent than the independent third-party data\ncollected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data sources may\ndiffer. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for\nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process.\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, it may not be\npractical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly\nvaluation process for VaR model calculations.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 149 for information regarding model\nreviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR\nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory\nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital\nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently\nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an\nexpected tail loss methodology which approximates a\n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to\n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital\nrules, which may be different than the positions\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the\ndiversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm’s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other components\nof market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g.,\nVaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the\nrespective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    135\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-additive\nnature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across\nLOBs, Corporate, and risk types.\n(b) Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR\nwere primarily driven by a private equity position\nthat became publicly traded at the end of the third\nquarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no\nlonger held this position.\n(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may\nhave occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents and consequently diversification benefit is\nnot meaningful.\nGenerally, average VaR across risk types and LOBs was\nlower due to volatility which occurred at the onset of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year\nhistorical look-back period, predominantly impacting\nexposures in fixed income and commodities. As a\nresult, average Total VaR decreased by $40 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 when compared with\nthe prior year. In the current year, maximum VaR\nremained elevated relative to average VaR as the\naforementioned volatility was still included in the\nhistorical look-back period in the first quarter of\n2021.\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of\nVaR to exclude certain real estate-related fair value\noption elected loans, and included them in other\nsensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure\nthe risk from these loans.

Daily\nRisk Management VaR has also declined, returning to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in late\nMarch of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back period.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nFirst Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter\n2021             2021              2021             2021\n136    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which\ncompares the daily Risk Management VaR results with\nthe daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR\nbacktesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in\nthe chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported\nrevenue as they exclude select components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution\nof new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities),\nfees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and\nnet interest income. These excluded components of\ntotal net revenue may more than offset the backtesting\ngain or loss on a particular day. The definition of\nbacktesting gains and losses above is consistent with\nthe requirements for backtesting under Basel III\ncapital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily\nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management\nVaR methodology, assuming current changes in market\nvalues are consistent with the historical changes used\nin the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions on\naverage five times every 100 trading days. The number\nof VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from\nthe statistically expected number of backtesting\nexceptions if the current level of market volatility\nis materially different from the level of market\nvolatility during the 12 months of historical data\nused in the VaR calculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the Firm\nposted backtesting gains on 145 of the 260 days, and\nobserved 20 VaR backtesting exceptions. Twelve of the\nbacktesting exceptions were in the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2021 as market volatility, particularly\nrelated to interest rates, was materially higher than\nthe market volatility in the 12 months of historical\ndata used for the VaR calculation. Firmwide\nbacktesting loss days can differ from the loss days\nfor which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets\nposted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as\nthe population of positions which compose each metric\nare different and due to the exclusion of select\ncomponents of total net revenue in backtesting gains\nand losses as described above. For more information on\nCIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of\nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December 31,\n2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management\nVaR.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but\npossible economic and market scenarios. The results\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for\nthose potential losses and are measured against\nlimits.\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of\npotential stress for both market rallies and market\nsell-offs, assuming significant changes in market\nfactors such as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array\nof hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on\ntail events in specific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact multiple market\nfactors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate\nspecific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk\nbetween different products. The flexibility in the\nstress framework allows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible\nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are\nreported periodically to senior management of the\nFirm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk\nStress Methodology Committee reviews and approves\nchanges to stress testing methodology and scenarios\nacross the Firm. Significant changes to the framework\nare escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board\nof Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework,\nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance.\nA profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the\nFirm’s traditional banking activities, which include\nextension of loans and credit facilities, taking\ndeposits, issuing debt and the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 for a\nsummary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk .\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk policy and related\nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board\nRisk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews it\nwith senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk\nfunction reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function\nis responsible for providing independent oversight and\ngovernance around assumptions and establishing and\nmonitoring limits for structural interest rate risk.\nThe Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities portfolio\nand interest rate derivatives.\nStructural interest rate risk can occur due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments\nas interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide\nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate\nrisk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer\npricing, which takes into account the elements of\ninterest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in\nfinancial markets. These elements include asset and\nliability balances and contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment schedules, expected\nprepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest\nrate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-\nrisk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The\nbaseline uses market interest rates and in the case of\ndeposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline for interest\nrate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”\ncurrencies). These simulations primarily include\nretained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-\n138    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and\nfunds transfer pricing of other positions in risk\nmanagement VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 134. Earnings-at-risk scenarios\nestimate the potential change to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months utilizing\nmultiple assumptions. These scenarios include a\nparallel shift involving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper\nyield curve involving holding short-term rates\nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter\nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant. These scenarios\nconsider many different factors, including: • The\nimpact on exposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but exclude\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to any\nsuch instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other factors\nwhich are updated periodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and\nscenarios do not include assumptions to account for\nthe reversal of Quantitative Easing. • The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,\nrepresent the amount by which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market interest rates.\nThe deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from\nactual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and\nother factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm’s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in\nthe Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a\nrelevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure,\nthe earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a\nforecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to\nOutlook on page 49 for additional information) .\nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in\nthe table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\nParallel shift:                          2021       2020\n+100 bps shift in rates               $   5.0    $   6.9\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates         1.8        2.4\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates        3.2        4.5\nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as\nof December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020\nreflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher\nrates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s\nbalance sheet.

The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital\ninvestments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of\nthe Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential\nimpact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market\nvariables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 134 for additional\ninformation on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk.

The Country Risk Management group actively\nmonitors the various portfolios which may be impacted\nby these developments and measures the extent to which\nthe Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s\nstrategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that assesses, manages and\nmonitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes\nthe following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards\nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks\nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and\nstress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting\ntrends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling\nmodels and ratings indicators, for early\nidentification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of\nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero\nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities\nwhich result in contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country exposure\nmeasure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not\nsuitable for attribution to an\nindividual country. The use of different measurement\napproaches or assumptions could affect the amount of\nreported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\nLending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\nDeposits are measured as the cash balances placed\nwith central and commercial banks\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their\nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral\nreceived\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair\nvalue of all positions, including both long and short\npositions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives protection purchased and sold is\nreported based on the underlying reference entity and\nis measured at the notional amount of protection\npurchased or sold, net of the fair value of the\nrecognized derivative receivable or payable. Credit\nderivatives protection purchased and sold in the\nFirm’s market-making activities is measured on a net\nbasis, as such activities often result in selling and\npurchasing protection related to the same underlying\nreference entity; this reflects the manner in which\nthe Firm manages these exposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    141\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims\nto estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements\nto a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management\nperiodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of\ncountries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and\ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as\nnecessary. COVID-19 Pandemic Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nindividual countries. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by\nCountry Risk Management to identify trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk\nmanagement purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special\nAdministrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with\nwhich they are associated. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2021, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit\nconditions. Country exposures may fluct uate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The\ndecrease in exposure to Germany and the increase in exposure to the United Kingdom were primarily due to changes in\ncash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management\nactivities in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased cash\nplacements with the central bank of Australia, largely driven by client activity following monetary policy\ndecisions in the country and growth in client deposits.\nTop 20\ncountrye…\n(excludi…\nthe\nU.S.)(a)\nDecember                   Lending          Trading\n31, (in                        and              and                           Total                       Total\nbillions)    2021       deposits(…       investing…       Other(d)         exposure    2020(e)         exposure\nUnited               $        81.7    $        12.7    $       2.0    $        96.4               $        68.4\nKingdom\nGermany                       65.3             -4.2            0.6             61.7                       127.2\nJapan                         38.8              6.4            0.3             45.5                        45.6\nAustralia                     29.2              9.9              —             39.1                        15.9\nSwitzerl…                     14.7              1.4            4.8             20.9                        18.7\nChina                         10.1              7.1            1.4             18.6                        21.2\nCanada                        14.7              2.0            0.2             16.9                        14.5\nIndia                          5.8              7.1            1.8             14.7                        10.5\nFrance                        11.0              2.0            1.0             14.0                        18.8\nSingapore                      6.8              4.6            0.9             12.3                         8.7\nBrazil                         5.3              6.7              —             12.0                        10.8\nLuxembou…                     10.1              1.4              —             11.5                        12.4\nSpain                          9.2              0.9              —             10.1                         5.8\nSaudi                          6.9              2.2              —              9.1                         5.8\nArabia\nSouth                          3.9              4.5            0.3              8.7                        10.1\nKorea\nItaly                          6.2              1.8            0.4              8.4                         9.7\nNetherla…                      5.5              0.7            0.6              6.8                         7.7\nBelgium                        5.0              1.8              —              6.8                         4.0\nHong Kong                      3.6              2.0            0.3              5.9                         6.2\nSAR\nMexico                         4.3              0.6              —              4.9                         4.9\n(a) Country exposures presented in the table reflect\n89% and 90% of total Firmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual country, at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Operational\nRisk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest\nitself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,\nbusiness disruptions (including those caused by\nextraordinary events beyond the Firm's control) cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or\nfailure of vendors or other third party providers to\nperform in accordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of the\nFirm’s financial position, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and regulatory\nenvironments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk\n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable\nthe Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and\ntest, manage and report on the Firm’s operational\nrisk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management\nOrganization, which consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the\nday-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework and the\nevaluation of the effectiveness of their control\nenvironments to determine where targeted remediation\nefforts may be required.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and\nFRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nis responsible for defining the CCOR Management\nFramework and establishing minimum standards for its\nexecution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead\nOfficers report to the Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are\nindependent of the respective businesses or functions\nthey oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is\nincluded in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy\nthat is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their control\nenvironment to assess where controls have failed, and\nto determine where remediation efforts may be\nrequired. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\norganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”)\nprovides oversight of and challenge to these\nevaluations and may also perform independent\nassessments of significant operational risk events and\nareas of concentrated or emerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the control\nenvironments and reporting the results to senior\nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses\noperational risks through quantitative means,\nincluding operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital\nestimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”)\nstatistical model, which simulates the frequency and\nseverity of future operational risk loss projections\nbased on historical data. The LDA model is used to\nestimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a\none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level.\nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal operational\nrisk losses in the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after\nthe issues or business activities giving rise to the\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the\nFirm’s operational risk-based capital methodology,\nwhich uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),\nincorporates internal and external losses as well as\nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of\nkey business environment and internal control metrics.\nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in\nits AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The\nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR\nand other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are leveraged as one\nof the key criteria in the independent monitoring and\ntesting of the LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with\nlaws, rules and regulation. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance independently\nidentify areas of heightened operational risk and\ntests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs\nand Corporate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    143\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation of\naction plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nEscalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for\nemployees at the Firm. Risks identified by Operational\nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate\nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed.\nOperational Risk and Compliance has established\nstandards to ensure that consistent operational risk\nreporting and operational risk reports are produced on\na Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate.\nReporting includes the evaluation of key risk and\nperformance indicators against established thresholds\nas well as the assessment of different types of\noperational risk against stated risk appetite. The\nstandards reinforce escalation protocols to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.\nOperational risk subcategories such as Compliance\nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and\nModel risk as well as other operational risks, can\nlead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s\noperational risk measurement processes. Refer to pages\n146, 147, 148 and 149, respectively for more\ninformation on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and\nEstimations and Model risk. Details on other select\nexamples of operational risks are provided below.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure\nto harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of\ntechnology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is\nan important and continuously evolving focus for the\nFirm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting\nand enhancing the security of computer systems,\nsoftware, networks, storage devices, and other\ntechnology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties\nattempting to obtain access to confidential\ninformation, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service,\nsabotage systems or cause other damage.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to\npotential new threats as well as expanded regulatory\nscrutiny including the introduction of new\ncybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make\nsignificant investments in enhancing its cyber defense\ncapabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with\nthe appropriate government and law enforcement\nagencies and other businesses in order to understand\nthe full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the\noperating environment, enhance defenses and improve\nresiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm\nactively participates in discussions and simulations\nof cybersecurity risks both internally and with\nlaw enforcement, government officials, peer and\nindustry groups, and has significantly increased\nefforts to educate employees and certain clients on\nthe topic of cybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or\nthat facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g.,\nvendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses,\ncentral depositories, and financial intermediaries)\nare also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.\nThird party cybersecurity incidents such as system\nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of\nsuch parties, or cyberattacks, including ransomware\nand supply-chain compromises could affect their\nability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or\nresult in lost or compromised information of the Firm\nor its clients. Clients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information\nassets, particularly when their activities and systems\nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control\nsystems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and\nongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients\nregarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to\nimprove security. However, where cybersecurity\nincidents occur as a result of client failures to\nmaintain the security of their own systems and\nprocesses, clients are responsible for losses\nincurred.\nTo protect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources\nand information, the Firm maintains a cybersecurity\nprogram designed to prevent, detect, and respond to\ncyberattacks. The Audit Committee is periodically\nprovided with updates on the Firm’s Information\nSecurity Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity\npolicies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve\nsecurity, as well as its efforts regarding significant\ncybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a\ncybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed\nto enable the Firm to respond to attempted\ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses\nwith law enforcement and other government agencies,\nand notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among\nother key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate\nthe risk of insider trading connected to a\ncybersecurity incident, and includes various\nescalation points.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm\nincreased the use of remote access and video\nconferencing solutions provided by third parties to\nfacilitate remote work. As a result the Firm deployed\nadditional precautionary measures and controls to\nmitigate cybersecurity risks and those measures and\ncontrols remain in place.\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are\nresponsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s\nInformation Security Program. In partnership with the\nFirm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Control organization identifies information\nsecurity risk issues and oversees programs for the\ntechnological protection of the Firm’s information\nresources including applications, infrastructure as\nwell as confidential\n144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nand personal information related to the Firm’s\nemployees and customers. The Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Controls organization consists of business\naligned information security managers that are\nsupported within the organization by the following\nproducts that execute the Information Security Program\nfor the Firm:\nCyber Operations\nIdentity & Access Management\nGovernance, Risk & Controls\nGlobal Technology Product Security\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control\ngovernance structure is designed to identify,\nescalate, and mitigate information security risks.\nThis structure uses key governance forums to\ndisseminate information and monitor technology\nefforts. These forums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm and include representatives\nfrom each LOB and Corporate. The forums are used to\nescalate information security risks or other matters\nas appropriate.\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities\ndesigned to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risk.\nThe Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes\ntraining that reinforces the Firm's Information\nTechnology Risk and Security Management policies,\nstandards and practices, as well as the expectation\nthat employees comply with these policies. The\nSecurity Awareness Program engages personnel through\ntraining on how to identify potential cybersecurity\nrisks and protect the Firm’s resources and\ninformation. This training is mandatory for all\nemployees globally on a periodic basis, and it is\nsupplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives,\nincluding periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides\nspecialized security training for certain employee\nroles such as application developers. Finally, the\nFirm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees\nto take periodic awareness training on data privacy.\nThis privacy-focused training includes information\nabout confidentiality and security, as well as\nresponding to unauthorized access to or use of\ninformation.\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s\ncontrol such as the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications\nloss, failure of a third party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks and, terrorism. The Firmwide\nBusiness Resiliency Program is designed to enable the\nFirm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover\nfrom business disruptions including occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control that may impact\ncritical business functions and supporting assets\n(i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third\nparties). The program includes governance, awareness\ntraining, planning and testing of recovery strategies,\nas well as strategic and tactical initiatives to\nidentify, assess, and manage business interruption and\npublic safety risks.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The risk of payment fraud normalized\nin 2021 since the heightened levels experienced during\nearlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm\ncontinues to employ various controls for managing\npayment fraud risk as well as providing employee and\nclient education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers and other third parties to a high level\nof operational performance and to mitigate key risks,\nincluding data loss and business disruptions. The\nCorporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible\nfor Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and\nstandards.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm.\nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers\nand maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park\nAssurance Company. Insurance may also be required by\nthird parties with whom the Firm does business.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    145\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-\nregulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership\nof and accountability for managing their compliance\nrisk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\nOrganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”),\nwhich is independent of the LOBs and Corporate,\nprovides independent review, monitoring and oversight\nof business operations with a focus on compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the\ndelivery of the Firm’s products and services to\nclients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs\nand Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks\nrelated to financial products and services,\nrelationships and interactions with clients and\ncustomers, and employee activities. For example,\ncompliance risks include those associated with anti-\nmoney laundering compliance, trading activities,\nmarket conduct, and complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations related to the offering of products\nand services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance\nrisk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary\nactivities, including the failure to exercise the\napplicable standard of care (such as the duties of\nloyalty or care), to act in the best interest of\nclients and customers or to treat clients and\ncustomers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance\nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s\nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\ncompliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR\nRisk Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and\nFRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite\nalso provides regular updates to the Board Risk\nCommittee and the Audit Committee. In certain cases,\nSpecial Purpose Committees of the Board may be\nestablished to oversee the Firm’s compliance with\nregulatory Consent Orders.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets\nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will\nconduct themselves with integrity at all times and\nprovides the principles that govern employee conduct\nwith clients, customers, shareholders and one another,\nas well as with the markets and communities in which\nthe Firm does business. The Code requires employees to\npromptly report any potential or actual violation of\nthe Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or\nregulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also\nrequires employees to report any illegal conduct, or\nconduct that violates the underlying principles of the\nCode, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients,\ncustomers, suppliers, contract workers, business\npartners, or agents. Code training is assigned to\nnewly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to\ncurrent employees periodically on an ongoing basis.\nEmployees are required to affirm their compliance with\nthe Code at least annually.\nEmployees can report any potential or actual\nviolations of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct\nHotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is\nanonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions\nwhere laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is\navailable at all times globally, with translation\nservices. It is administered by an outside service\nprovider. The Code prohibits retaliation against\nanyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith.\nPeriodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on\nthe Code of Conduct program.\n146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk that any action or inaction by an employee or\nemployees could lead to unfair client or customer\noutcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which\nthe Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s\nreputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying\nand managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate\nengagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture\nconsistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business\nPrinciples (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as\na guide for how employees are expected to conduct\nthemselves. With the Principles serving as a guide,\nthe Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for\neach employee and provides information and resources\nto help e mployees conduct business ethically and in\ncompliance with the laws everywhere the Firm operates.\nRefer to Compliance Risk Management on page 146 for\nfurther discussion of the Code.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR\nManagement policy, which establishes the framework for\ngovernance, identification, measurement, monitoring\nand testing, management and reporting conduct ris k in\nthe Firm.\nThe Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of\nthe Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more\nholistic view of conduct risks and to connect key\nprograms across the Firm in order to identify\nopportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum\nis responsible for setting overall program direction\nfor strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee\nconduct framework and reviewing the consolidated\nFirmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.\nConduct risk management encompasses various aspects of\npeople management practices throughout the employee\nlife cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training\nand development, performance management, promotion and\ncompensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO,\nand each designated corporate function completes an\nassessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews\nmetrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and\nprovides conduct education as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    147\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nLEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nLegal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the\nrisk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged\nfailure to meet legal obligations that arise from the\nrule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates, agreements with clients and customers, and\nproducts and services offered by the Firm.\nOverview\nThe global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal\nservices and advice to the Firm.

The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital\nrequirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating\nthe allowance for credit losses and making business\ndecisions. A dedicated independent function, Model\nRisk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and\ngoverns the Firm’s policies relating to the management\nof model risk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, such as\nthose used in risk management, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent\napproach which is used for models, as described in\ndetail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the Firm based on the specific purposes of such\nmodels. Users and developers of models are responsible\nfor developing, implementing and testing their models,\nas well as referring models to the MRGR for review and\napproval. Once models have been approved, model users\nand developers are responsible for maintaining a\nrobust operating environment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing\nbasis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the portfolios and in\nproduct and market developments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling techniques and\nsystems capabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated\nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval of the MRGR.\nIn its review of a model, the MRGR considers whether\nthe model is suitable for the specific purposes for\nwhich it will be used. When reviewing a model, the\nMRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and\nthe reasonableness of model assumptions, and may\nperform or require additional testing, including back-\ntesting of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved\nby the appropriate level of management within the MRGR\nbased on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing models, prior to\ntheir use. In certain circumstances exceptions may be\ngranted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be\nused prior to review or approval. The MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to\nmitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the\ninterim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of\nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly\ntrue when the current and forecasted environment is\nsignificantly different from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which the models were\ntrained, as the Firm experienced during the early\nstages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics\nto inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical\nperiods.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 150-153 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    149\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its reported\nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm’s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance\nfor credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that\nare relevant for exposures across the Firm, with\nmodeled credit losses being driven primarily by a\nsubset of less than twenty variables. The specific\nvariables that have the greatest effect on the modeled\nlosses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nreal GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real\nestate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing a weighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the\nFirm assigned more balanced weightings to both its\nadverse and upside scenarios compared to the\nsignificant weighting that the Firm placed on its\nadverse scenarios as of December 31, 2020, reflecting\nthe sustained improvement and resilience of the\nmacroeconomic environment, despite the ongoing impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, because the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental\nactions taken in response to the pandemic caused a\ndislocation in certain historical relationships used\nfor modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues\nto place reliance on management judgment and make\nadjustments specific to that dislocation, although to\na lesser extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit\nlosses of $18.7 billion reflects remaining\nuncertainties, including the potential impact that\nadditional waves or variants of COVID-19 may have on\nthe pace of economic growth and near-term supply chain\ndisruptions.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 129 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.8% higher\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 4.4% in the second quarter\nof 2022; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly\n150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\n3.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of approximately 6.5% in the\nsecond quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a\npeak difference of nearly 15.8% in the second quarter\nof 2023. This analysis is not intended to estimate\nexpected future changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses as the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables. Additionally,\nexpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate\nthe sensitivity of credit loss estimates to\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2021, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative\nadverse scenario to its central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the lending exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: • An increase of approximately\n$550 million for residential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $2.6 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $3.0 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and\nthat its estimates of expected credit losses were\nreasonable and appropriate for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021 . Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries\na portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.\nThe majority of such assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\nincluding, derivatives and structured note products.\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis, including certain\nmortgage, home equity and other loans, where the\ncarrying value is based on the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral. Assets measured at fair value\nThe following table includes the Firm’s assets\nmeasured at fair value and the portion of such assets\nthat are classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nValuation Details of the Firm’s processes for\ndetermining fair value are set out in Note 2.\nEstimating fair value requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of judgment required is\nlargely dependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models and\nother valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more significant than\nthose required when estimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In\narriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    151\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in\nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with\neach business combination is allocated to the related\nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, including the\npotential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business\nperformance, estimated market cost of equity, as well\nas actual business results and projections of business\nperformance for its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting\nunits was not impaired as of December 31, 2021. For\neach of the reporting units, fair value exceeded\ncarrying value by at least 10% and there was no\nindication of a significant risk of goodwill\nimpairment based on current projections and\nvaluations.\nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are\nconsistent with management’s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best\nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in\nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of December 31, 2021.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an\neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety\nof rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form\nof account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm\nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected\nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is\naccrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is\nreduced when the cardholder redeems points. This\nliability was $9.8 billion and $7.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was driven by continued growth in rewards\npoints earned on increased spend and promotional\noffers outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a\nlesser extent adjustments to redemption rate\nassumptions.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate\n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions. These\nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and\nmanagement judgment. Updates to these assumptions will\nimpact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2021,\na combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the rewards\nliability by approximately $265 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be\nsubject to different interpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of accounting for income\ntaxes, including the provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must\nmake assumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain items\nmay affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\njurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by the\nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where\nthe Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding\nits view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities\nmay be settled by audit, administrative appeals or\nadjudication in the court systems\n152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nof the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates.\nJPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be\nassessed additional income taxes as a result of the\nresolution of these matters, and the Firm records\nadditional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.\nIn addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of\nincome taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results\nof operations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets\nand liabilities measured for financial reporting\nversus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets\nare recognized if, in management’s judgment, their\nrealizability is determined to be more likely than not\n. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of\na change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax\ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs\nregular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews include\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions regarding\nfuture taxable income , including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be available\nto utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In\nconnection with these reviews, if it is determined\nthat a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. The valuation\nallowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting\nperiod if the Firm determines that, based on revised\nestimates of future taxable income or changes in tax\nplanning strategies, it is more likely than not that\nall or part of the deferred tax asset will become\nrealizable. As of December 31, 2021, management has\ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm\nwill realize its deferred tax assets, net of the\nexisting valuation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the\nreassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective\nincome tax rate in the period in which the\nreassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that\nits estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount\ncould be different from the amounts reflected in the\nFirm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the\nextent that the final outcome of these\namounts is different than the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will generally impact the Firm’s provision\nfor income taxes in the period in which such a\ndetermination is made.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of\ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred\ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and\nassumptions that could differ from the actual results\nreflected in income tax returns filed during the\nsubsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns\nare generally recorded in the period when the tax\nreturns are filed and the global tax implications are\nknown, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax\nrate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income\ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant\nestimates and judgments associated with establishing\nlitigation reserves.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    153\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards\nBoard\n(“FASB”) Standards Adopted since\nJanuary\n1, 2021\nStandard                              Summary of guidance                    Effects on financial statements\nProvides optional expedients and\nexceptions to current accounting\nguidance when financial\ninstruments, hedge accounting\nrelationships, and other\ntransactions are amended due to\nreference rate reform.\nProvides an election to account\nfor certain contract amendments        •Issued and effective March 12,\nrelated to reference rate reform as    2020.

(“JPMorgan Chase”\nor the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed by, or under the supervision of,\nthe Firm’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and\neffected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of\nJPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making\nthe assessment, management used the “Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2021, JPMorgan\nChase’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management’s assessment, the\nFirm determined that there were no material weaknesses\nin its internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their\nreport which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 22, 2022\n156    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2021, including the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). We also have audited the\nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\nreferred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2021 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our\nopinion, the Firm maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Firm changed the manner in which it\naccounts for credit losses on certain financial\ninstruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in\nthe accompanying Management’s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary\nto permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew\nYork, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    157\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component\nof Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios was $14.0 billion on total\nportfolio-based retained loans of $711.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 . The Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the\nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the\nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied\nare determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take\ninto consideration the Firm's economic outlook as\nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S. unemployment and\nU.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of\nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as\nthe Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining\nthe quantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the\nadjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls\nover model validation and generation of macroeconomic\nscenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i)\nevaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.2 trillion\nof its assets and $403.1 billion of its liabilities at\nfair value on a recurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $9.6 billion of trading assets and $41.5\nbillion of liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, collectively financial instruments,\nwhich are classified as level 3 as they contain one or\nmore inputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation models and\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the\nlevel 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs\nused by management to estimate the fair value of\ncertain of these financial instruments include forward\nequity prices, volatility relating to interest rates\nand equity prices and correlation relating to interest\nrates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange\nrates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the inputs to\nestimate fair value, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\nin performing procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence obtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our\n158    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s\ndetermination of the fair value, including controls\nover models, inputs, and data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge to\nassist in developing an independent estimate of fair\nvalue for a sample of these financial instruments and\ncomparing management’s estimate to the independently\ndeveloped estimate of fair value.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business\nsegments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.\nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by\nregulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Notably in the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax\ncredits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of the\nassociated tax-oriented investments.Refer to Note 25 for further information. Consolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest\nentities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting\nrights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of\nentities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of\nvoting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of\nthe majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm\ncontrol, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over\noperating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for\n(i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate\nshare of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments\nare generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored\nasset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these\nentities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the\nability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based\non a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important\ndecisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases\nwhere the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm\nevaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and\nhas both power and a potentially significant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds\nhave investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity\nand venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and,\naccordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest\nrevenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.\nVariable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the\nentity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have\nequity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations\nthrough voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to\nreceive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in\nsecuritization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to\ninvestors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of\nthose assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the\ncash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash\nflows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other\nentities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party\nthat has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The\nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    165\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in\nestablishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the\nactivities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if\nany, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting\nthe VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights\nover the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power\nto direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the\nright to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of\nits economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other\narrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in\ndetermining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors\nconsidered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure;\nsubordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the\nVIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going\nreassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have\nbecome VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether\nchanges in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation\nconclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest\nincome The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a\nlevel-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion of interest\nincome. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts\nwith customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions,\nand components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for\nfurther discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan\nChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily\nin principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer\nto Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of\nconsolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign\ncurrency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional\ncurrency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the\nfunctional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets\nand liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance\nsheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and\npurchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be\npresented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including\nderivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting\nagreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement\nto be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default\n(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when\ndue). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are\nterminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted\nagainst the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is\nof one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase\n166    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nagreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all\nvalues of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each\nother and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination\namount. Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin\nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to\nthe party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically\nrequires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the\nmargin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold.\nThe collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-\noff any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted\ncollateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the\nproceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Statements of\ncash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in\ncash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting standard adopted\nJanuary 1, 2020 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) The adoption of this guidance established a single\nallowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit\nexposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s\nremaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of\nthe CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses represented management’s estimate of probable\ncredit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. The adoption\nof CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $2.7 billion decrease to retained earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    167\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan Chase’s other\nsignificant accounting policies and the Note and page\nwhere a detailed description of each policy can be\nfound.\nFair value measurement                    Note 2     page 169\nFair value option                         Note 3     page 190\nDerivative instruments                    Note 5     page 196\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest       Note 6     page 211\nexpense\nInterest income and Interest expense      Note 7     page 214\nPension and other postretirement          Note 8     page 215\nemployee benefit plans\nEmployee share-based incentives           Note 9     page 218\nInvestment securities                     Note 10    page 220\nSecurities financing activities           Note 11    page 226\nLoans                                     Note 12    page 229\nAllowance for credit losses               Note 13    page 248\nVariable interest entities                Note 14    page 253\nGoodwill and Mortgage servicing rights    Note 15    page 261\nPremises and equipment                    Note 16    page 265\nLeases                                    Note 18    page 266\nLong-term debt                            Note 20    page 269\nEarnings per share                        Note 23    page 274\nIncome taxes                              Note 25    page 277\nOff–balance sheet lending-related\nfinancial instruments, guarantees and     Note 28    page 283\nother commitments\nLitigation                                Note 30    page 290\n168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value. These assets and\nliabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on\na recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that\nare measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets). Certain assets,\nliabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments\nare measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis;\nthat is, they are not measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments only in certain circumstances (for\nexample, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair\nvalue is defined as the price that would be received\nto sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market\nprices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes\nare not available, fair value is based on valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques that consider\nrelevant transaction characteristics (such as\nmaturity) and use, as inputs, observable or\nunobservable market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation\nadjustments may be made to ensure that financial\ninstruments are recorded at fair value, as described\nbelow. The level of precision in estimating\nunobservable market inputs or other factors can affect\nthe amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular\nposition. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with\nthose of other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and may\nvary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The\nFirm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions by other market\nparticipants compared with those used by the Firm\ncould result in the Firm deriving a different estimate\nof fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing\nfair value estimates for assets and liabilities\ncarried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”),\nwhich is part of the Firm’s Finance function and\nindependent of the risk-taking functions, is\nresponsible for verifying these estimates and\ndetermining any fair value adjustments that may be\nrequired to ensure that the Firm’s positions are\nrecorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s\nValuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is composed\nof senior finance and risk executives, is responsible\nfor overseeing the management of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across the Firm. The\nFirmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the\nVCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller),\nand includes sub-forums covering the\nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions\nincluding Treasury and CIO. Price verification process\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the\nrisk-taking functions by leveraging independently\nderived prices, valuation inputs and other market\ndata, where available. Where independent prices or\ninputs are not available, the VCG performs additional\nreview to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates.\nThe additional review may include evaluating the\nlimited market activity including client unwinds,\nbenchmarking valuation inputs to those used for\nsimilar instruments, decomposing the valuation of\nstructured instruments into individual components,\ncomparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing\nprofit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in\ncollateral valuation. There are also additional levels\nof management review for more significant or complex\npositions. The VCG determines any valuation\nadjustments that may be required to the estimates\nprovided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments\nto quoted prices are applied for instruments\nclassified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy\n(refer to the discussion below for further information\non the fair value hierarchy). For other positions,\njudgment is required to assess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and, for\ncertain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the\nsize of the net open risk position. The determination\nof such adjustments follows a consistent framework\nacross the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are\nconsidered where an observable external price or\nvaluation parameter exists but is of lower\nreliability, potentially due to lower market activity.\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are made based on\ncurrent market conditions. Factors that may be\nconsidered in determining the liquidity adjustment\ninclude analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer\nspread for the instrument being traded; (2)\nalternative pricing points for similar instruments in\nactive markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values\nthat the price or parameter could take. • The Firm\nmanages certain portfolios of financial instruments on\nthe basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted\nby U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value\nof such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the\nentire net open risk position in an orderly\ntransaction. Where this is the case, valuation\nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk\nposition. Where applied, such adjustments are based on\nfactors that a relevant market participant would\nconsider in the transfer of the net open risk\nposition, including the size of the adverse market\nmove that is likely to occur during the period\nrequired to reduce the net open risk position to a\nnormal market-size. • Uncertainty adjustments related\nto unobservable parameters may be made when positions\nare valued\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    169\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nusing prices or input parameters to valuation models\nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market activity\nor because they cannot be implied from observable\nmarket data. Such prices or parameters must be\nestimated and are, therefore, subject to management\njudgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the\nuncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation\nestimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies\nadjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to\nappropriately reflect counterparty credit quality\n(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the\nimpact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework\nacross the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding\nadjustments on page 186 of this Note for more\ninformation on such adjustments. Valuation model\nreview and approval If prices or quotes are not\navailable for an instrument or a similar instrument,\nfair value is generally determined using valuation\nmodels that consider relevant transaction terms such\nas maturity and use as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the\ncase the price verification process described above is\napplied to the inputs in those models. Under the\nFirm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,\nthe MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as\nmaterial changes to existing models, prior to\nimplementation in the operating environment. In\ncertain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. The MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk\nif it is to be used in the interim. These actions will\ndepend on the model and may include, for example,\nlimitation of trading activity. Fair value hierarchy A\nthree-level fair value hierarchy has been established\nunder U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value\nmeasurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the\nobservability of inputs to the valuation of an asset\nor liability as of the measurement date. The three\nlevels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to\nthe valuation methodology are quoted prices\n(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation\nmethodology include quoted prices for similar assets\nand liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs\nto the valuation methodology are unobservable and\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. A financial\ninstrument’s categorization within the fair value\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\n170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant\nproducts/instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument                    Valuation methodology                 Classifications in the fair value\nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements       Valuations are based on discounted    Predominantly level 2\ncash flows, which consider:\nDerivative features: refer to\nthe\ndiscussion of derivatives below\nfor\nfurther information.\nMarket rates for the respective\nmaturity\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related             Where observable market data is\ncommitments —                         available, valuations are based       Level 2 or 3\nwholesale                             on:\nLoans carried at fair value\n(trading loans and non-trading        •  Observed market prices\nloans) and associated                 (circumstances are infrequent)\nlending-related commitments\nRelevant broker quotes\nObserved market prices for\nsimilar\ninstruments\nWhere observable market data is\nunavailable or limited, valuations\nare\nbased on discounted cash flows,\nwhich\nconsider the following:\nCredit spreads derived from the\ncost of CDS; or benchmark credit\ncurves developed by the Firm, by\nindustry and credit rating\nPrepayment speed\nCollateral characteristics\nFair value is based on observable\nmarket prices for mortgage-backed\nsecurities with similar collateral\nand incorporates adjustments to\nLoans — consumer                      these prices to account for           Predominantly level 2\ndifferences between the securities\nand the value of the underlying\nloans, which include credit\ncharacteristics, portfolio\ncomposition, and liquidity.\nLoans carried at fair value —\nconforming\nresidential mortgage loans\nexpected to\nbe sold\nInvestment and trading securities     Quoted market prices                  Level 1\nIn the absence of quoted market\nprices, securities are valued         Level 2 or 3\nbased on:\nObservable market prices for\nsimilar securities\nRelevant broker quotes\nDiscounted cash flows\nIn addition, the following inputs\nto discounted cash flows are used\nfor the following products:\nMortgage- and asset-backed\nsecurities specific inputs:\nCollateral characteristics\nDeal-specific payment and loss\nallocations\nCurrent market assumptions\nrelated to yield, prepayment\nspeed, conditional default rates\nand loss severity\nCollateralized loan obligations\n(“CLOs”) specific inputs:\nCollateral characteristics\nDeal-specific payment and loss\nallocations\nExpected prepayment speed,\nconditional default rates, loss\nseverity\nCredit spreads\nCredit rating data\nPhysical commodities                  Valued using observable market        Level 1 or 2\nprices or data.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    171\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nProduct/instrument                    Valuation methodology                  Classifications in the fair value\nhierarchy\nExchange-traded derivatives that\nDerivatives                           are actively traded and valued         Level 1\nusing the exchange price.\nDerivatives that are valued using\nmodels such as the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model, simulation\nmodels, or a combination of models\nthat may use observable or\nunobservable valuation inputs as\nwell as considering the contractual\nterms.

is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge\naccounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities\ninventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    175\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and\nother funds, were $ 801million and $ 670million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, were trading assets of $ 51million and $ 52million, respectively, and other assets of $ 750million and $\n618million, respectively.\n(e) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $ 26.2billion and $ 15.1billion, respectively, of residential first-\nlien mortgages, and $ 8.2billion and $ 6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government\nagencies of $ 13.6billion and $ 8.4billion, respectively.\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n176    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair\nvalue is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 169-173 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to\nthe lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of\nsuch inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In\naddition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input\nvalues presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the\ndegree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of\nthe instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    177\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3\ninputs(a)\nDecember\n31, 2021\nFair    Principal     Unobserva…      Range of\nProduct/…

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a\nchange in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do\nexist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following\ndiscussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that\naffect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the\ninterest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield,\nin isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the\namount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for\ntaking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security\nprimarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the\ncoupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the\nrange of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit\nspreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a\ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par\nand an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the\nremaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being\npaid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The\nconditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between\nconditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has\nhigh prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in\nthe conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional\ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional\ndefault rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the\ninverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate\nliquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An\nincrease in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in\nvaluing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including\nthe LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    179\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation\ninputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one\nparameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or\na decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in\nisolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the\nvaluation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of\nthose risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between\ntwo interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as\nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a\nmeasure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the\nparticular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options,\nincluding equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in\nisolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the\nvaluation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from\nthat of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nInterest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve\nis used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the\ndiscounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to\npurchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the\nvalue of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain\nderivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset,\nand the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset\nuntil the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the\nConsolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the\nFirm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that\nis, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and\nlosses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the\nvaluation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables\ndo not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.\n180    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nFa…                                                                                          Ch…\nva…

These\nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors\nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s\nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it\nis generally necessary to make adjustments to the base\nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA\nrepresents the adjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect\ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates\nCVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected\npositive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s\nexisting positions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of default\nand estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the\nprobability of a default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated\nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied\nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences\nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to\nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally\nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents\nthe adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is\nrecognized where there is evidence that a market\nparticipant in the principal market would incorporate\nit in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the\nexpected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s\npositions with\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at\nthe relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with the counterparty,\nand therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue\nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality\non the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality\nover time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                         2021       2020       2019\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA                    $   362    $  -337    $   241\nDerivatives FVA                         47        -64        199\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on\nfair value option elected liabilities reflects changes\n(subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the\nFirm’s probability of default and LGD, which are\nestimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread\nobserved in the bond market.

However, this table does not include other items, such as\nnonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion\nof management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not\ndisclosed in this table. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that\napproximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments\ninclude cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale\nagreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings,\nfederal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity\n(i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the\ninherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\n188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDec…                                                   Dec…\n31,                                                    31,\n2021                                                   2020\nEst…                                                   Es…\nfair                                                   fa…\nval…                                                   va…\nhie…                                                   hi…\nTot…                                                 Tot…\n(in       Car…       Lev…       Lev…       Lev…       est…       Car…       Le…       Lev…       Le…       est…\nbi…       val…          1          2          3       fair       val…         1          2         3       fair\nval…                                                 val…\nFi…\nas…\nCa…\nand\ndue    $  26.4    $  26.4    $     —    $     —    $  26.4    $  24.9    $  24…    $     —    $    —    $  24.9\nfr…\nba…\nDe…\nwi…       714…       714…          —          —       714…       502…       50…          —         —       502…\nba…\nAc…\nin…\nand       102…          —       102…        0.1       102…       89.4         —       89.3       0.1       89.4\nac…\nre…\nFe…\nfu…\nso…\nand\nse…        9.0          —        9.0          —        9.0       58.3         —       58.3         —       58.3\npu…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSe…       124…          —       124…          —       124…       107…         —       107…         —       107…\nbo…\nIn…\nse…       363…       183…       179…          —       362…       201…       53…       152…         —       205…\nhe…\nLo…\nnet\nof\nal…       1,0…          —       202…       821…       1,0…       940…         —       210…       75…       966…\nfor\nlo…\nlo…\nOt…       98.7          —       97.4        1.4       98.8       81.8         —       80.0       1.9       81.9\nFi…\nli…\nDe…    $  2,4…    $     —    $  2,4…    $     —    $  2,4…    $  2,1…    $    —    $  2,1…    $    —    $  2,1…\nFe…\nfu…\npu…\nand\nse…\nlo…       67.9          —       67.9          —       67.9       59.5         —       59.5         —       59.5\nor\nso…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSh…       33.6          —       33.6          —       33.6       28.3         —       28.3         —       28.3\nbo…\nAc…\npa…\nand       217…          —       212…        4.9       217…       186…         —       181…       4.3       186…\not…\nli…\nBe…\nin…\nis…       10.7          —       10.8          —       10.8       17.5         —       17.6         —       17.6\nby\nco…\nVI…\nLo…       226…          —       229…        3.1       232…       204…         —       209…       3.2       212…\nde…\n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,\nincluding expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary\nmarket spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.

The Firm has elected to\nmeasure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility\ncaused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that\notherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are\naccounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair\nvalue basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated\nas part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value\nbasis, including lending-related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests\nin securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be\nseparately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are\npredominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of\nclient-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization\ntrusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value\n190    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value\nfor the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are\ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s\ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of\nagreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the\nprincipal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-\nspecific credit risk related to these agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    191\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, for loans, long-term debt and long-term\nbeneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nDece…\n31,                                               Fair                                                 Fair\n(in                                              value                                                value\nmill…         2021                              over/…             2020                              over/…\nLoans       Contr…                              contr…           Contr…                              contr…\nNona…       princ…                   Fair       princ…           princ…                   Fair       princ…\nloans       outst…                  value       outst…           outst…                  value       outst…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas       $   3,263              $     546    $  -2,717        $   3,386              $     555    $  -2,831\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans          918                    797         -121            1,867                  1,507         -360\nSubt…        4,181                  1,343       -2,838            5,253                  2,062       -3,191\n90 or\nmore\ndays\npast\ndue\nand\ngove…\nguar…\nLoan…          293                    281          -12              328                    317          -11\nAll\nother\nperf…\nloan…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas           8,594                  7,528       -1,066            7,917                  6,439       -1,478\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans       57,695                 57,742           47           42,022                 42,650          628\nSubt…       66,289                 65,270       -1,019           49,939                 49,089         -850\nTotal    $  70,763              $  66,894    $  -3,869        $  55,520              $  51,468    $  -4,052\nloans\nLong…\ndebt\nPrin…    $  35,957        -d    $  33,799    $  -2,158        $  40,560        -d    $  40,526    $     -34\ndebt\nNonp…               NA             41,135               NA               NA             36,291               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $  74,934               NA               NA          $  76,817               NA\ndebt\nLong…\nbene…\ninte…\nNonp…               NA          $      12               NA               NA          $      41               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $      12               NA               NA          $      41               NA\nbene…\ninte…\n(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies.\n(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term\nbeneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the\nFirm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and\nlong-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for\nstructured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature\nembedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both\nnonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual\nprincipal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value\noption was elected was $ 11.9billion and $ 18.1billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $\n10million and $( 39) million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit\nrisk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are\nmanaged primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the\nportfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty\nbasis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,\nsecuritizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on loans.

Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for\nfurther information.\n(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 94% and 6%,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2021 and 92% and 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2020 . Refer to Note 14 for more\ninformation on exposures to SPEs.\n(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and\nreadily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and\nmonitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and\naccounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\n(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 729.6billion and $ 516.9billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.\n(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative receivables.\n(i) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $ 5.4billion and $ 19.2billion of loans in Business Banking under the\nPPP, respectively. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm\ntypically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these\nloans.\n(j) Represents lending-related financial instruments.\n(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    195\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 5 – Derivative instruments\nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a\ncombination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability\nwithout having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in\nderivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of\nthe Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to\nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or\nselling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk\nmanagement derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments,\nincluding derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the\nrisk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in\nmarket value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of\nvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses\non the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain\nforeign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or\nforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to\nmanage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are\nexpected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are\nused to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the\nCredit derivatives section on pages 207-210 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to\nthe risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 207 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and\nlosses tables on pages 204-206 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative\ncounterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled\nbilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures\nand options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts\ntraded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the\ntransactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing\nmember at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services.\nAccounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to\nbe recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets\nderivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative\ndepends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that\nare not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on\npages 200-207 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets,\nliabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in\nstructured notes.\n196    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management\nactivities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk\nof loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For\nthe same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity\nderivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be\ndesignated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must\nidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as\ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those\nterms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS\nsecurities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain\namounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life\nof the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings\nas a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of\nthe hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow\nhedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and\nliabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the\nfair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item –\nprimarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is\nterminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash\nflows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the\nvalue of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are\nnot the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to\nchanges in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the\nassessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    197\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table

Where such a legal opinion has not been\neither sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those\nderivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).\nThese amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not\neligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are\nshown separately as \" Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets \" in the tables below, up to the\nfair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent\nwith the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or

It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk\ninherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk,\nas the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as\nthe fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and\nits subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the\ncontract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-\ncleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings\ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2021\nand 2020.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade\ntriggers\nDecember 31, (in millions)                                                        2021               2020\nAggregate fair value of net derivative                                 $  20,114          $  26,945          -a\npayables\nCollateral posted                                                         19,402             26,289\n(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrelated to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be\ntriggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating\nagency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major\nrating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity\nimpact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies\nreferred to in the derivative contract.\nLiquidity\nimpact of\ndowngrade\ntriggers on OTC\nand OTC-cleared\nderivatives                      2021                                         2020\nDecember 31,             Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch\n(in millions)               downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade\nAmount of\nadditional\ncollateral to      $              219    $             1,577    $              119    $             1,243\nbe\nposted upon\ndowngrade(a)\nAmount required\nto settle\ncontracts with                     98                    787                   153                  1,682    -c\ntermination\ntriggers upon\ndowngrade(b)\n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\n(c) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the\neconomic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing\ntransactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale\nand a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated\nderivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    203\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income\nThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge\naccounting\ndesignation or purpose.\nFair value hedge gains and losses\nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting\nrelationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Gains and losses\nwere recorded in principal transactions revenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management\ncategories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection\npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments\nunder the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its\nobligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has\nthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is\nboth a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit\nderivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the\nneeds of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives\ncounterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial\ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    207\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-\nname”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts.\nSingle-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are\nused to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P\n500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series\nof CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the\nreference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios\nof reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide\nprotection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such\nstructures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the\noccurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to\nthe reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the\nface value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit\nderivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt\ninstrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit\nevent occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the\ncredit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the\ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in\nreturn, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The\nissuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the\nentities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the\nissuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference\nbetween the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following\ntables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically\npay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be\npaid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement.\nThe Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar\nunderlying reference entities.

The related contracts are\noften terminable on demand and the Firm has no\nremaining obligation to deliver future services. For\narrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue associated\nwith these remaining performance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future events or\nunderlying asset values, and is not recognized until\nthe outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue category includes\ndebt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via\npublic offering and private placement of various types\nof debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are recognized as\nrevenue typically upon execution of the client’s\ntransaction.

Certain credit card products offer\nthe cardholder the ability to earn points based on\naccount activity, which the cardholder can choose to\nredeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the\nFirm related to these proprietary rewards programs\nvaries based on multiple factors including the terms\nand conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder\nactivity, cardholder reward redemption rates and\ncardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a\nliability for its obligations under its rewards\nprograms and reports the current-period cost as a\nreduction of card income. Credit card revenue sharing\nagreements The Firm has contractual agreements with\nnumerous co-brand partners that grant the Firm\nexclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card\nproducts and market them to the customers of such\npartners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit\ncard programs and provide their customer or member\nlists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct\nmarketing activities and provide rewards redeemable\nunder their own loyalty programs that the Firm will\ngrant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account\nactivity. The terms of these agreements generally\nrange from fiveto ten years.\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand\ncredit card partners based on the cost of partners’\nmarketing activities and loyalty program rewards\nprovided to credit cardholders, new account\noriginations and sales volumes. Payments to partners\nbased on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners\nare expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as\nmarketing expense.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new\nparticipants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S.\nemployees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1,\n2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts\nbased on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that\nprovide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered\nunder these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements\nin certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the\n401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k)\nSavings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well\nas an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts\nrecorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nDefined benefit\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,       pension and OPEB plans\n(in millions)                                                    2021          2020\nProjected benefit obligations               $                 -18,046    $  -19,137\nFair value of plan assets                                      25,692        25,417\nNet funded status                                               7,646         6,280\nAccumulated other comprehensive                                  -453        -1,586\nincome/(loss)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, was\n2.54% and 2.17%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in\nOCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent\nperiods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected\nbenefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected\nremaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, the net gain was predominantly attributable to a market-driven increase in the fair value of plan\nassets and changes in the discount rate.\nThe following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements\nof income for the Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive\nincome for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nPension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)                           2021        2020         2019\nTotal net periodic defined benefit plan    $                    -201    $   -285    $     144\ncost/(credit)\nTotal defined contribution plans                               1,333       1,332          952\nTotal pension and OPEB cost included in    $                   1,132    $  1,047    $   1,096\nnoninterest expense\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive    $                  -1,129    $   -214    $  -1,157\nincome\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit\ncosts for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31,                                                   2021       2020       2019\nDiscount rate                                                             2.17  %    2.93  %    3.89  %\nExpected long-term rate of return on                                      2.97  %    3.91  %    5.08  %\nplan assets\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    215\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nPlan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of\nreturn is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for the\nvarious asset classes, taking into consideration local\nmarket conditions and the specific allocation of plan\nassets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a\nforward-looking approach and are not strictly based on\nhistorical returns, with consideration given to\ncurrent market conditions and the portfolio mix of\neach plan. The discount rates used in determining the\nbenefit obligations are generally provided by the\nFirm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by\nreference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with\nmaturity dates and coupons that closely match each of\nthe plan’s projected cash flows.\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of\nthe Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in\nvarious trusts and are invested in well-diversified\nportfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash\nand cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The\nFirm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset\nmanagers, as well as other factors that could impact\nthe portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed\nnecessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by\nasset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit\nplan are 42- 100% debt securities, 0- 40% equity\nsecurities, 0- 3% real estate, and 0- 12% alternatives\nas of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021,\nassets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans do not include securities issued by\nJPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through\nindirect exposures through investments in exchange\ntraded funds, mutual funds and collective investment\nfunds managed by third-parties.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2021, 83million shares of common stock were available for\nissuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based\nincentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of\nacquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based\nincentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted\nannually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common\nstock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow\nemployees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to\npost-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback\nprovisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle\nthe recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the\nperiod the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s\nBoard of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are\nsubject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards\nthat vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting\nperiod are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are\nconverted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested,\nthe shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional\ntwo-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately fiveto eightyears from the grant\ndate depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and\nstock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common\nstock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten yearsafter the grant date. In 2021, the Firm\nawarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5million and 750,000SARs,\nrespectively. There were no material grants of SARs or stock options in 2020 and 2019. The Firm separately\nrecognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a\nseparate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized\non a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the\nemployees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility\nprovisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value\nof awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of\npost-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the\nvesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier\nof the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for\nissuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common\nstock or treasury shares. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by\nissuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for\npurposes of calculating earnings per share.\n218    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nRSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by\nthe stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-\nScholes valuation model.

The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share-based\ncompensation awards to employees.\nTax benefits Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or d ividend equivalents) related to share-\nbased incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $ 957million, $ 837million and $ 895million, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    219\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 10 – Investment securities\nInvestment securities consist of debt securities that\nare classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities\nclassified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2.\nPredominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities\nare held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its\nasset-liability management activities. AFS securities\nare carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any\napplicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance\nfor credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are included\nin investment securities gains/(losses) on the\nConsolidated statements of income. HTM securities,\nwhich the Firm has the intent and ability to hold\nuntil maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of\nallowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities,\npurchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized\ninto interest income on a level-yield basis over the\ncontractual life of the security. However, premiums on\ncertain callable debt securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date. During the second quarter of 2021,\nthe Firm transferred $ 104.5billion of investment\nsecurities from AFS to HTM for capital management\npurposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $\n425million on the securities at the date of transfer.\nUnrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of\nthese securities continue to be reported in AOCI and\nare amortized into interest income on a level-yield\nbasis over the remaining life of the securities. This\namortization will offset the effect on interest income\nof the amortization of the premium or discount\nresulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.\nTransfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash\ntransactions and are recorded at fair value.\n220    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates\nindicated.\nDece…\n31,\n(in\nmill…\nAvai…\nsecu…         2021        Gross        Gross                       2020        Gross         Gross\nMort…       Amort…       unrea…       unrea…         Fair       Amorti…       unrea…       unreal…         Fair\nsecu…       cost(…        gains       losses        value       cost(b…        gains        losses        value\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand      $  72,800    $     736    $     993    $  72,543    $  110,979    $   2,372    $       50    $  113,3…\ngove…\nagen…\nResi…\nU.S.         2,128           38            2        2,164         6,246          224             3        6,467\nNon-…        3,882           25            1        3,906         3,751           20             5        3,766\nComm…        4,944           22           17        4,949         2,819           71            34        2,856\nTotal\nmort…       83,754          821        1,013       83,562       123,795        2,687            92       126,3…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         178,0…          668        1,243       177,4…       199,910        2,141           100       201,9…\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.        14,890          972            2       15,860        18,993        1,404             1       20,396\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nNon-…\ngove…       16,163           92           46       16,209        22,587          354            13       22,928\ndebt\nsecu…\nCorp…\ndebt           332            8           19          321           215            4             3          216\nsecu…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan         9,674            6           18        9,662        10,055           24            31       10,048\nobli…\nOther        5,403           47            2        5,448         6,174           91            16        6,249\nTotal\navai…       308,2…        2,614        2,343       308,5…       381,729        6,705           256       388,1…\nsecu…\nHeld…\nsecu…\nMort…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand         102,5…        1,400          853       103,1…       107,889        2,968            29       110,8…\ngove…\nagen…\nU.S.         7,316            1          106        7,211         4,345            8            30        4,323\nResi…\nComm…        3,730           11           54        3,687         2,602           77             —        2,679\nTotal\nmort…       113,6…        1,412        1,013       114,0…       114,836        3,053            59       117,8…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         185,2…          169        2,103       183,2…        53,184           50             —       53,234\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.        13,985          453           44       14,394        12,751          519             —       13,270\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan        48,869           75           22       48,922        21,050           90             2       21,138\nobli…\nOther        2,047            1            7        2,041             —            —             —            —\nTotal\nheld…       363,7…        2,110        3,189       362,6…       201,821        3,712            61       205,4…\nsecu…\nTotal\ninve…\nsecu…\nnet\nof       $  671,9…    $   4,724    $   5,532    $  671,1…    $  583,550    $  10,417    $      317    $  593,6…\nallo…\nfor\ncred…\nloss…\n(a) The Firm purchased $ 111.8billion, $ 12.4billion and $ 13.4billion of HTM securities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 42million and $\n78million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(c) Excludes $ 1.9billion and $ 2.1billion of accrued interest receivables at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its\npolicy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse\nthrough interest income any accrued interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit\nrating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the\nportfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and\nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default\n(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at\nacquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the\nlife of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    221\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm\nhas the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its\namortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment\nloss recognized in investment securities\ngains/(losses) is equal to the full difference between\nthe amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable)\nand the fair value of the security. For impaired debt\nsecurities that the Firm has the intent and ability to\nhold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a\ncredit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit\nloss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance\nfor credit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment\nnot due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. Factors\nconsidered in evaluating credit losses include adverse\nconditions specifically related to the industry,\ngeographic area or financial condition of the issuer\nor underlying collateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When assessing securities\nissued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm\nestimates cash flows considering relevant market and\neconomic data, underlying loan-level data, and\nstructural features of the securitization, such as\nsubordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or\nother forms of credit enhancement, and compares the\nlosses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool\nlosses”) against the level of credit enhancement in\nthe securitization structure to determine whether\nthese features are sufficient to absorb the pool\nlosses, or whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations that are rated\nbelow “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be\ncontractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a\nway that the Firm would not recover substantially all\nof its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates\nimpairment for credit losses when there is an adverse\nchange in expected cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    223\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nHTM securities – credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses represents\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of HTM securities. The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated by applying statistical\ncredit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived\nusing a weighted average of five internally developed\neight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation to revert to\nlong run historical information for periods beyond the\nforecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further\ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential\nmortgage-backed securities is calculated as the\ndifference between the amortized cost and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected,\ndiscounted at the security’s effective interest rate.\nThese cash flow estimates are developed based on\nexpectations of underlying collateral performance\nderived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast\nand the single year straight-line interpolation, as\nwell as considering the structural features of the\nsecurity. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance for\ncredit losses is subject to significant management\njudgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over\nanother, or considering other inputs or assumptions,\ncould affect the estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM securities. Credit quality indicator The\nprimary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is\nthe risk rating assigned to each security. At both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, all HTM securities were\nrated investment grade and were current and accruing,\nwith approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\nAllowance for credit losses on investment securities\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities was $ 42million and $ 78million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are\nused where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual\nmaturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be\nprepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    225\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,\n“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover\nshort sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s\nexcess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the\nsame counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets\nand liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the\nlife of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm\nhas elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option\nhas been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,\nwith changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for\nhybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)\nthat it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged\ncollateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin\nlevels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the\npermissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash\nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to\nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It\nis also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in\nsecurities financing agreements.\n226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the\neconomic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet\npresentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master\nnetting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or\nobtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where\nthe Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can\nbe pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and\nthe obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAmounts         Amounts not\nAmounts        presented on         nettable on\nDecember 31,                           netted on the                 the                 the\n(in                                     Consolidated        Consolidated        Consolidated\nmillions)                   2021             balance             balance             balance                Net\nAssets             Gross amounts              sheets              sheets           sheets(b)         amounts(c)\nSecurities\npurchased       $        604,724    $       -343,093    $        261,631    $       -245,588    $        16,043\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               250,333             -44,262             206,071            -154,599             51,472\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        532,899    $       -343,093    $        189,806    $       -166,456    $        23,350\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                52,610             -44,262               8,348              -8,133                215\nother(a)\nAmounts         Amounts not\nAmounts        presented on         nettable on\nDecember 31,                           netted on the                 the                 the\n(in                                     Consolidated        Consolidated        Consolidated\nmillions)                   2020             balance             balance             balance                Net\nAssets             Gross amounts              sheets              sheets           sheets(b)         amounts(c)\nSecurities\npurchased       $        666,467    $       -370,183    $        296,284    $       -273,206    $        23,078\nunder resale\nagreements\nSecurities               193,700             -33,065             160,635            -115,219             45,416\nborrowed\nLiabilities\nSecurities\nsold under      $        578,060    $       -370,183    $        207,877    $       -191,980    $        15,897\nrepurchase\nagreements\nSecurities\nloaned and                41,366             -33,065               8,301              -8,257                 44\nother(a)\n(a) Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $ 5.6billion and $ 3.4billion at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.\n(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that\ncounterparty.

The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n“retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of\nthe Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment,\nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign\nexchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on\nperforming loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued\ninterest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then\nrecognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit\nlosses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to accrued interest on\ncertain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for\nloan losses. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued\ninterest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing\ninterest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended.\nLoans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,\nregardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90days or\nmore, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due\nwhen the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain\nloans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally,\ncollateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the\namortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash\ninterest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible;\nhowever, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash\nreceipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans,\napplication of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans\non a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been\ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As\npermitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;\naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or\npaid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit\nlosses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet\nas a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan\nlosses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to\nNote 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable\nvalue of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance\nfor loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the\nFFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally\ncharged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later\nthan 120days past due. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier\nthan the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • Loans modified in a TDR that are\ndetermined to be collateral-dependent.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    229\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are\nsubject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or\ncharged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the\nautomobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the\ngovernment-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has\nbeen realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the\nprioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its\namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair\nvalue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the\ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes.\nFor illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation\nsources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s\nprice opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation\n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12months, or more frequently depending on various\nmarket factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by\ntaking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that\nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted\nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans,\ncollateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values\nare typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans\nheld-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded\nin noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans,\nthe valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts\nor premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and\ndiscounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual\npolicies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is\naccrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in\nnoninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs\nare recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value,\nthe Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair\nvalue are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information\non loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n230    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-\nrelated losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to\nchanges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event\nthat management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to\nmodify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the\nFirm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments\nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness,\nor the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported\nas TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in\nmany cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to\nperforming status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has\nperformed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an\nexpectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt\ncapacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In\ncertain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans\nare not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for\nimpairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-\ndefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been\nreturned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s\nasset-specific allowance. The Firm granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: • they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by\nregulatory guidance, or • the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the\nCARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022. To the extent\nthat certain modifications did not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounted for them as TDRs. As\npermitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm did not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual\nstatus where such loans were not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considered expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit\nlosses. Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,\nnonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or\nnonaccrual status. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings,\nworkouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and\nbuildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm\nrecognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or\nphysical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received\nat foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower.\nForeclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted,\nif necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to\nnoninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.\nForeclosures have resumed after having been temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    231\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to\ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

Loans that are more than 30days past\ndue provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable\nor unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely\nto be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater\nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar\nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary\nbased on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or\nthe combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the\nevent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit\npayment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher\nrisk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a\nlow FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit\nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights\ninto the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\n234    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n…\n…       D…\n…       3…\n…       2…\n…\n…                                                                  R…\n…                                                                  l…                           To…\n…\n…\nP…                 W…       Co…\n…       2…        2…        2…        2…        to                 t…        to\n2…                 r…       te…\np…       lo…\n…\n…\n…    $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  7…     $  1…     $  4…             $  6,…     $  1…              $  2…\n…\n…       13        23        27        27        22        5…                 11        1…                 8…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…        —        11        21        25        33        1…                  6        2…                 1…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  6…     $  4…     $  1…     $  7…     $  1…     $  5…             $  6,…     $  1…              $  2…\n…\n%\n…\n…\n…\n…       0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     0…  %     3…  %             0.…  %     3…  %              1…  %\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…                               …\n…\n…                …               …\n…       …        …        …        …                …               …\n…                …               …\n…               …\n$  …       …    $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …       …    $  …       …    $  …       …    $  …\n9               …        …        …        …        …               …               …               …\n3               …        …        …        …        …               …               …               …\n$  …            $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …            $  …            $  …            $  …\n…  %            …  %     …  %     …  %     …  %     …  %    …       …  %    …       …  %    …       …  %\n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows:\ncurrent included $ 35million and $ 36million; 30–149 days past due included $ 11million and $ 16million; and 150 or\nmore days past due included $ 20million and $ 24million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are\ngenerally not considered delinquent.\n(c) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies of $ 31million and $ 40million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due.

The dollar amounts presented represent\nthe balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real\nestate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments\npast due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or\nanother similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not\nbe representative of ultimate redefault levels.\nAt December 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently\nmodified in TDRs were 4years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both\nvoluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\nActive and suspended foreclosure\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies, with a carrying value of $ 619million and $ 846million, respectively, that were not included\nin REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\n238    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nAuto and other\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\nauto and other consumer loans.\nD…\n3…\n2…\n…       T…\n…       l…                                                                              …\n…       by                                                                              …\n…       o…\ny…\nP…                W…       …\n…                …                …       2…        …        to                t…       …        T…\n2…                r…       …\np…       …\n…\n…\n…    $  3…       …    $  1…       …    $  7…     $  …     $  1…     $  …             $  …     $  1…     $  …\n…\n…       1…               7…               88        …        31        …                …         6        …\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…        —               35                —        —         1        1                5         7        …\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  3…            $  1…            $  7…     $  …     $  1…     $  …             $  …     $  1…     $  …\n…\n%\n…\n…\n…\n…       0…  %            0…  %            1…  %     …  %     1…  %     …  %             …  %     9…  %     …  %\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\nD…\n3…\n2…\n…       T…\n…       l…                                                                          Re…\n…       by                                                                          lo…\n…       o…\ny…\nP…                 W…       Co…\n…                2…       2…        2…        2…        to                 t…        to        T…\n2…                 r…       te…\np…       lo…\n…\n…\n…    $  4…       -d    $  1…     $  7…     $  4…     $  2…     $  7…             $  2,…     $  1…     $  76…\n…\n…       97                1…        77        53        42        23                 30        17        446\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…        —                 —         —         1         —         1                  8         8         18\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  4…             $  1…     $  7…     $  4…     $  2…     $  7…             $  2,…     $  1…     $  76…\n…\n%\n…\n…\n…\n…       0…  %             0…  %     1…  %     1…  %     2…  %     3…  %             1.…  %     1…  %     0.…  %\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are\ngenerally not considered delinquent.\n(b) At December 31, 2021, auto and other loans excluded $ 667million of PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA that are 30\nor more days past due.

Delinquency\nrates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that\nborrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been\ndelinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the\ngeographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does\nnot view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a\nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the\nportfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random\nsample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry\nbenchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However,\ncertain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes\nin the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\ncredit card loans.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)                                         2021\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans(b)        Total\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                     151,798     $    901     $  152,699\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                                770           59            829\n90 or more days past due and still                                    741           27            768\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                     153,309     $    987     $  154,296\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                             0.99  %      8.71  %        1.04  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                             0.48         2.74           0.50\nloans\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)                                         2020\nWithin the revolving period                    Converted to term loans(b)        Total\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent and less than 30 days past          $                     139,783     $  1,239     $  141,022\ndueand still accruing\n30–89 days past due and still accruing                                997           94          1,091\n90 or more days past due and still                                  1,277           42          1,319\naccruing\nTotal retained loans                        $                     142,057     $  1,375     $  143,432\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained                             1.60  %      9.89  %        1.68  %\nloans\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained                             0.90         3.05           0.92\nloans\n(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are\ngenerally not considered delinquent.\n(b) Represents TDRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    241\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)                           December 31, 2021              December 31, 2020\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia                                 $   23,030                     $   20,921\nTexas                                          15,879                         14,544\nNew York                                       12,652                         11,919\nFlorida                                        10,412                          9,562\nIllinois                                        8,530                          8,006\nNew Jersey                                      6,367                          5,927\nOhio                                            4,923                          4,673\nPennsylvania                                    4,708                          4,476\nColorado                                        4,573                          4,092\nMichigan                                        3,773                          3,553\nAll other                                      59,449                         55,759\nTotal retained loans                       $  154,296                     $  143,432\nPercentage of portfolio based on\ncarrying value with estimated refreshed\nFICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660                     88.5  %                        85.9  %\nLess than 660                                    11.3                           13.9\nNo FICO available                                 0.2                            0.2\n(a) The geographic regions presented in the table are\nordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2021.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer loan modification programs granting\nconcessions to credit card borrowers who are\nexperiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card loans under\nlong-term programs. These modifications involve\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically include reducing\nthe interest rate on the credit card. Substantially\nall modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs\nare considered to be TDRs.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating\nassigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within\nthe portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will\ndefault. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several\nfactors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s\ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however\nthe quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3\nor higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the\ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s\ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist\nof special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis\nby Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to\nfulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor\nconducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the\nmanagement and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries\nwith actual or potential credit concern.

New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n881million, $ 734million and $ 407million, respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020\nand 2019 reflected deferral of principal and interest payments, extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets\nin partial satisfaction of the loan predominantly in Other and Commercial and Industrial loan classes.

The allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance\nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,\nwhich is recognized within investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of\nall changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about\nthe effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures,\nconsidering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance\nfor loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer\nto Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments The allowance for loan\nlosses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not\nrecord an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit\ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans and certain performing, modified loans to\nborrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not\nrecord an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write t hese receivables off no\nlater than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by\nconsidering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call\noptions. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future\npayments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of\nthe funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using\nan approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility\nand Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged\noff, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating\nthe allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether\nexposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the\nexposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional\ncharacteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include\nproduct type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans,\ncurrent LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include LOB, geography, risk\nrating, delinquency status, level and type of collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility\npurpose, tenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with\nother similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”).\nThe portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related\ncommitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates\nexpected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that\nindividual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans\nmodified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a\nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from\none risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s\nexpected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The\ncredit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of\ndefault. They are derived using\n248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\na weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods\nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse,\nextreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting\nteam. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject\nmatter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from\nsenior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to\ntake into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are\nnot yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in\nmaking this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political\nconditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an\nindustry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit\nquality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by\nmanagement to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine\nthe asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which\nforeclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally\nevaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using\nfactors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as\nthe difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are\ngenerally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair\nvalue of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value\n(to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that\nshould be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of\ncollateral). The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified\nin TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest,\nprincipal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real\nestate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of\ndefault estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities\nof default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans\nand certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also\nconsiders its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card\nloans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and\ncharge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified\nor expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability\nto repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as\nthese cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including\nredefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any\nexpected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions.

Refer to\nNote 1 for further information.\n(b) Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when\nactual losses for a pool exceeded estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the\ntime of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.\n(c) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed\nprobable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected\nto be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been\n250    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nplaced on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans\nmodified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual\ninterest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.\n(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n(e) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, lending-related commitments excluded $ 15.7billion, $ 19.5billion and $\n9.8billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 730.5billion, $ 658.5billion\nand $ 650.7billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 32.1billion, $ 25.3billion and $\n24.1billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for\nlending-related commitments.

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the\nmacroeconomic environment, consisting of: • a $ 9.5billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card\nportfolio; and • a $ 2.6billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31,\n2021, the Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse and upside scenarios compared to the\nsignificant weighting that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of December 31, 2020, reflecting the\nsustained improvement and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental actions taken in response to\nthe pandemic caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used for modeling credit loss estimates, the\nFirm continues to place reliance on management judgment and make adjustments specific to that dislocation, although\nto a lesser extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of $ 18.7billion reflects remaining uncertainties,\nincluding the potential impact that additional waves or variants of COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic\ngrowth and near-term supply chain disruptions.\nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and year over year growth in U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22       4Q22       2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21       4Q21       2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 9.2  %     3.5  %     3.9  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) As of December 31, 2021, the year over year growth\nin U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the\ncentral scenario is calculated as the percent change\nin U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial\ninstruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business               Transaction Type                                     Activity    2021 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB                            Credit card securitization       Securitization of originated    253-254\ntrusts                                credit card receivables\nServicing and securitization\nMortgage securitization        of both originated and                                254-256\ntrusts                         purchased residential\nmortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other                   originated and purchased\nCIB                            securitization trusts              residential and commercial    254-256\nmortgages, and other\nconsumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits          markets in a cost-efficient                               256\nmanner and structuring\ntransactions to meet investor\nneeds\nMunicipal bond vehicles        Financing of municipal bond                           256-257\ninvestments\nThe Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a\nlesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is\ncompetitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to\nbe significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCommercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including\ncertain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of\nthese entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the\nentity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in\nthe same manner as any other third-party transaction.\nCorporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are\ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of\ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties\nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not\nhave the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these\nentities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nRefer to pages 257-258 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the\nVIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the\nChase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes\nservicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior\nand subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of\nits sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts\nbased on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other\nduties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any\nrelated modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement\nwith the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive\ncertain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card\nreceivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial\ninterests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the\nclaims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to\nmaintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $ 7.1billion and $\n5.4billion, respectively. The Firm\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    253\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nmaintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 57% and\n39% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and\nretained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are\neliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has\nsecuritized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans\nprimarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective\nbusiness involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2021           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    55,085    $       942    $    47,029    $       974    $       684    $        95    $    1,753\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…         10,966             27         10,115              2              —              —             2\nCommer…\nand            150,694              —         93,698            671          3,274            506         4,451\nother(…\nTotal      $   216,745    $       969    $   150,842    $     1,647    $     3,958    $       601    $    6,206\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2020           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    49,644    $     1,693    $    41,265    $       574    $       724    $         —    $    1,298\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…         12,896             46         12,154              9              —              —             9\nCommer…\nand            119,732              —         92,351            955          1,549            262         2,766\nother(…\nTotal      $   182,272    $     1,739    $   145,770    $     1,538    $     2,273    $       262    $    4,073\n(a) Excludes U.S. GSEs and government agency securitizations and re-securitizations, which are not Firm-sponsored.\n(b) Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables\npurchased from third parties.\n(c) Excludes the following: retained servicing; securities retained from loan sales and securitization activity\nrelated to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to\nmanage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities; senior and subordinated securities of $\n145million and $ 36million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $ 105million and $ 40million, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2020, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.\n(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 79% and 73%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests,\nwhich are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 1.6billion and $ 1.3billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $\n131million and $ 41million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 3.5billion and $ 2.0billion of\ninvestment-grade retained interests, and $ 929million and $ 753million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential\nmortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased from third\nparties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains\nservicing for all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for certain mortgage\nloans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is\nresponsible for decisions related to loan\nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization\ntrusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior\nand/or subordinated interests (including residual\ninterests and amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization, and/or\nreacquires positions in the secondary market in the\nnormal course of business. In certain instances, as a\nresult of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered\ntogether with the servicing arrangements entered into\nby CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm\ndoes not consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-\nsponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore\ndoes not have the power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and\nother consumer securitizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in\nunderwriting and trading activities involving the\nsecurities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may\nretain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests\n(including amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization but,\ngenerally, the Firm does not service commercial loan\nsecuritizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest\nin these securitizations as well. For commercial\nmortgage securitizations the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE generally is held by\nthe servicer or investors in a specified class of\nsecurities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally\ndoes not retain an interest in the controlling class\nin its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization\ntransactions. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in\ncertain re-securitization transactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential\nmortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is\nlargely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in\nthe re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                             2021         2020         2019\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  53,923    $  46,123    $  25,852\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort\nand decisions in establishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the significant\neconomic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did\nnot transfer any private label securities to re-\nsecuritization VIEs during 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and retained interests in any such Firm-\nsponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were\nimmaterial. Additionally, the Firm may invest in\nbeneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-\nsecuritizations and generally purchases these\ninterests in the secondary market. In these\ncircumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral\nability to direct the most significant activities of\nthe re-securitization trust, either because it was not\ninvolved in the initial design of the trust, or the\nFirm was involved with an independent third-party\nsponsor and demonstrated shared power over the\ncreation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    255\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31,                                   Nonconsolidated\n(in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2021        2020\nInterest in VIEs                     $                   1,947    $  2,631\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm did not\nconsolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy\nremote entities that provide secured financing,\ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other\nfinancial assets, to customers of the Firm. The\nconduits fund their financing facilities through the\nissuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary\nsource of repayment of the commercial paper is the\ncash flows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-\nspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits\nby the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third\nparties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are\ngenerally structured to cover a multiple of historical\nlosses expected on the pool of assets, and are\ntypically in the form of overcollateralization\nprovided by the seller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on\nits agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely\nrepayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the\nconduits with funding to provide financing to\ncustomers in the event that the conduits do not obtain\nfunding in the commercial paper market, each asset\npool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated with it\nprovided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity\nfacilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the\nform of standby letters of credit. The amount of\nprogram-wide credit enhancement required is based upon\ncommercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm\nconsolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the conduits and a\npotentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in\nstructuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions\nregarding asset types and credit quality, and manages\nthe commercial paper funding needs of the conduits.\nThe Firm’s interests that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as\nadministrative agent and liquidity and program-wide\ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential\nexposure created by the liquidity and credit\nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes\nmarkets in and invests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm\nheld $ 13.7billion and $ 13.5billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nwhich have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs\nand capacity and were not driven by market\nilliquidity. Other than the amounts required to be\nheld pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm\nis not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity\nfacilities, program-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated\nin consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 13.4billion and $ 12.2billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are\nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to extend\ncredit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option\nbond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance\ntheir municipal bond investments at short-term rates.\nIn a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases\nhighly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and\nfunds the purchase by issuing two types of securities:\n(1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”)\nand (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests\n(“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by\nmoney market funds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB\ntrust. The residuals are retained by the investor\nseeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB\ntransactions where the residual is held by a third-\nparty investor are typically known as customer TOB\ntrusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions\nwhere the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer\nTOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm\nserves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide various services to\na TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is\nresponsible for establishing the periodic variable\nrate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement\nand remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing\nagent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in\nfloaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material\nduring 2021 and 2020. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole\nliquidity or tender option provider for the TOB\ntrusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to\n256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nperform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure\nto pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds\nor the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s\nexposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess\ncollateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual\nholders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent\ncannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the\nTOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts\nare considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the\nResidual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be\nsignificant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLiabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,                                                                        intere…\n2021          Assets                                                            in\n(in          Trading                                           Total           VIE                        Total\nmilli…        assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…       assets…       Other(f)       liabil…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $  11,108          $      102    $    11,210    $    2,397    $         1    $    2,398\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             1       19,883                  71         19,955         6,198             41         6,239\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           2,009            —                   2          2,011         1,976              —         1,976\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —          955                  32            987           179             85           264\nentit…\nOther              —        1,078    -b           283          1,361             —            118           118\nTotal     $    2,010    $  33,024          $      490    $    35,524    $   10,750    $       245    $   10,995\nAssets                                                       Liabil…\nDecem…                                                                     Benefi…\n31,          Trading                                           Total       intere…                        Total\n2020          assets        Loans             Other(…       assets(…            in       Other(f)       liabil…\n(in                                                                            VIE\nmilli…                                                                     assets…\nVIE\nprogr…\ntype\nFirm-…\ncredit    $        —    $  11,962          $      148    $    12,110    $    4,943    $         3    $    4,946\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-…\nmulti…             2       23,787                 188         23,977        10,523             33        10,556\ncondu…\nMunic…\nbond           1,930            —                   2          1,932         1,902              —         1,902\nvehic…\nMortg…\nsecur…             —        1,694                  94          1,788           210            108           318\nentit…\nOther              2          176                 249            427             —             89            89\nTotal     $    1,934    $  37,619          $      681    $    40,234    $   17,578    $       233    $   17,811\n(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Largely includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities.

Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.6billion\nand $ 5.2billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    257\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,\nrepresented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 26.8billion and $ 23.6billion, of which $\n9.4billion and $ 8.7billion was unfunded at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss\nexposure amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to\nreduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax\ncredits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more\ninformation on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The\nFirm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement\nagreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has\nrecourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect\nResidual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate\ncustomer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer\nTOB trusts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $ 6.8billion and $ 6.7billion, respectively. The fair value of assets\nheld by such VIEs at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 10.5billion. Loan securitizations The Firm has\nsecuritized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, and commercial\nmortgages. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate\nliquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the\nFirm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting\ncriteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors;\n(2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3)\nthe Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot\nrepurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the\nholder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a\ngain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests,\nor servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are\nreported in noninterest revenue.\n258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,                   2021       Commercial             2020       Commercial             2019       Commercial\n(in             Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and\nmillions)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)\nPrincipal    $      23,876    $      14,917    $       7,103    $       6,624    $       9,957    $       9,390\nsecuriti…\nAll cash\nflows\nduring\nthe\nperiod:(…\nProceeds\nreceived\nfrom loan    $      24,450    $      15,044    $       7,321    $       6,865    $      10,238    $       9,544\nsales as\nfinancial\ninstrume…\nServicing\nfees                   153                1              211                1              287                2\ncollected\nCash\nflows\nreceived               578              273              801              239              507              237\non\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser.

The\nFirm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans\nfrom Ginnie Mae loan\npools as it continues to service them and/or manage\nthe foreclosure process in accordance with the\napplicable requirements, and such loans continue to be\ninsured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase\noption becomes exercisable, such loans must be\nreported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan\nwith a corresponding liability.

The adoption of the guidance requires\nrecognition of an impairment loss when the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit falls below its\ncarrying value. It eliminated the requirement that an\nimpairment loss be recognized only\nif the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is\nbelow its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test\nis generally performed by comparing the current fair\nvalue of each reporting unit with its carrying value.\nIf the fair value is in excess of the carrying value,\nthen the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not\nto be impaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value, then an impairment charge is\nrecognized for the amount by which the reporting\nunit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to\nthe amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting\nunit. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated\ncapital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a\nproxy for the carrying values of equity for the\nreporting units in the goodwill impairment testing.\nReporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis\nas the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes\ninto consideration a variety of factors including\ncapital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital\nlevels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget\nprocess, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors. Allocated capital is further reviewed\nperiodically and updated as needed. The primary method\nthe Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its\nreporting units is the income approach. This approach\nprojects cash flows for the forecast period and uses\nthe perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal\nvalues. These cash flows and terminal values are then\ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate.\nProjections of cash flows are based on the reporting\nunits’ earnings forecasts which are reviewed with\nsenior management of the Firm. The discount rate used\nfor each reporting unit represents an estimate of the\ncost of equity for that reporting unit and is\ndetermined considering the Firm’s overall estimated\ncost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the risk\ncharacteristics specific to each reporting unit (for\nexample, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty\nassociated with the business or management’s forecasts\nand assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the\ndiscount rates used for each reporting unit,\nmanagement compares the discount rate to the estimated\ncost of equity for publicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk characteristics. In\naddition, the weighted average cost of equity\n(aggregating the various reporting units) is compared\nwith the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to\nensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis are then compared with\nmarket-based trading and transaction multiples for\nrelevant competitors. Trading and transaction\ncomparables are used as general indicators to assess\nthe overall reasonableness of the estimated fair\nvalues, although precise conclusions generally cannot\nbe drawn due to the differences that naturally exist\nbetween the Firm’s businesses and competitor\ninstitutions. Management also takes into consideration\na comparison between the aggregate fair values of the\nFirm’s reporting\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    261\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nunits and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several\nfactors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the\nlevel of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and\n(iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting\nunits. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting\nunits to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period\nrelated to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of\nexpected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated\nfuture servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines\nover time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual\nservicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or\nsecuritization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to\naccount for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the\navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one\naggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted\nspread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the\nFirm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to\nservice, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value\nestimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and\nactual portfolio experience.\n262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs\ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase\nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.\nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is\nto offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related\nrisk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)                                                2021               2020               2019\nFair value at beginning of period           $  3,276          $   4,699          $   6,130\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                           1,659                944              1,384\nPurchase of MSRs                               1,363                248                105\nDisposition of MSRs(a)                          -114               -176               -789\nNet additions/(dispositions)                   2,908              1,016                700\nChanges due to collection/realization of        -788               -899               -951\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and         404             -1,568               -893\nother(b)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to              109                -54               -333          -e\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                     —                199                153\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)           -415               -117               -107\nTotal changes in valuation due to other         -306                 28               -287\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs          98             -1,540             -1,180\nand assumptions\nFair value at December 31,                  $  5,494          $   3,276          $   4,699\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $     98          $  -1,540          $  -1,180\nat December 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and        1,298              1,325              1,639\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at           520                448                522\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at December           1.6                1.8                2.0\n31, (in billions)(d)\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities\n(“SMBS”) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual\nmaturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is\nreasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are\nreported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements\nimpose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or\nenter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental\npayments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to\nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease\npayments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are\nrecognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the\nlease term.

Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board\nof Directors authorized a new common share repurchase\nprogram for up to $ 30billion. As directed by the\nFederal Reserve, total net repurchases and common\nstock dividends in the first and second quarters of\n2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average\nof the Firm’s net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters. On June 24, 2021, the Federal\nReserve announced that the temporary restrictions on\ncapital distributions would expire on June 30, 2021 as\na result of the Firm remaining above its minimum risk-\nbased capital requirements under the 2021 CCAR stress\ntest. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject\nto the normal capital distribution restrictions\nprovided under the regulatory capital framework. The\nFirm continues to be authorized to repurchase common\nshares under its existing common share repurchase\nprogram previously approved by the Board of Directors.\nThe following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020\nand 2019.\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)                  2021       2020(a)               2019\nTotal number of shares of common stock          119.7                50.0        213.0\nrepurchased\nAggregate purchase price of common stock    $  18,448          $    6,397    $  24,121\nrepurchases\n(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm\ntemporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks,\nincluding the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.\nThe authorization to repurchase common shares is\nutilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of\npurchases and the exact amount of common shares that\nmay be repurchased is subject to various factors,\nincluding market conditions; legal and regulatory\nconsiderations affecting the amount and timing of\nrepurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position\n(taking into account goodwill and intangibles);\ninternal capital generation; and alternative\ninvestment opportunities. The repurchase program does\nnot include specific price targets or timetables; may\nbe suspended by management at any time; and may be\nexecuted through open market purchases or privately\nnegotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1\nplans, which are written trading plans that the Firm\nmay enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow\nthe Firm to repurchase its common shares during\nperiods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing\ncommon shares —for example, during internal trading\nblackout periods. As of December 31, 2021,\napproximately 58.3million shares of common stock were\nreserved for issuance under various employee\nincentive, compensation, option and stock purchase\nplans, and directors’ compensation plans.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    273\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 23 – Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using\nthe two-class method. Under the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated\nto common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan\nChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation\nprograms, predominantly all of which entitle\nrecipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends\npaid to holders of the Firm’s common stock.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability method to provide\nincome taxes on all transactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future\ntax consequences of temporary differences between the\ncarrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and\ntax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or\nliability for each temporary difference is determined\nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in\neffect when the underlying items of income and expense\nare realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred portions of\nthat expense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities\narising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being taxed in a\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions, significant\njudgments and estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase\nand the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files\ntax returns may not be finalized for several years.\nThus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and\nliabilities may ultimately be different from those\ncurrently reported. In the first quarter of 2021, the\nFirm reclassified certain deferred investment tax\ncredits from accounts payable and other liabilities to\nother assets to be a reduction to the carrying value\nof the associated tax-oriented investments. The\nreclassification also resulted in an increase in\nincome tax expense and a corresponding increase in\nother income, with no effect on net income.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits are certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These unrecognized\nitems include the tax effect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state and local\nunrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the\nbenefit from associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.\nunrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in\nother jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under\naudit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably\nby the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the\nTax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase\nis presently under audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, it is reasonably possible that over the\nnext 12 months the resolution of these examinations\nmay increase or decrease the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits by as much as approximately\n$ 300million. Upon settlement of an audit, the change\nin the unrecognized tax benefit would result from\npayment or income statement recognition.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the\nbeginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                   2021        2020         2019\nBalance at January 1,                       $  4,250    $  4,024    $   4,861\nIncreases based on tax positions related         798         685          871\nto the current period\nIncreases based on tax positions related         393         362           10\nto prior periods\nDecreases based on tax positions related        -657        -705         -706\nto prior periods\nDecreases related to cash settlements           -148        -116       -1,012\nwith taxing authorities\nBalance at December 31,                     $  4,636    $  4,250    $   4,024\nAfter-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties\nrelated to income tax liabilities recognized in income\ntax expense were $ 174million, $ 147million and $( 52)\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, in addition to the\nliability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had\naccrued $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively,\nfor income tax-related interest and penaltie s.\nTax examination status\nJPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities\nthroughout the world, and by many state and local\njurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table\nsummarizes the status of significant income tax\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries as of December 31, 2021.\nPeriods under examination    Status\nJPMorgan Chase – U.S.              2011 – 2013                  Field examination of amended returns\nJPMorgan Chase – U.S.              2014 - 2018                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – New York State    2012 - 2014                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – New York City     2015 - 2017                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – California        2011 – 2012                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – U.K.              2006 – 2019                  Field examination of certain select entities\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    279\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted\nassets and intercompany funds transfers\nRestricted cash and other restricted assets\nCertain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are\nrestricted as to withdrawal or usage. These\nrestrictions are imposed by various regulatory\nauthorities based on the particular activities of the\nFirm’s subsidiaries.\nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject\nto examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is\na member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its\ndeposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject\nto applicable limits.\nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at\ncertain non-US central banks.\nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations\nestablished by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As\npart of its compliance with the respective regulatory\nrequirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are\nsubject to certain restrictions on cash and other\nassets.\nThe following table presents the components of the\nFirm’s restricted cash:\nDecember 31, (in billions)                                                        2021       2020\nSegregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers         14.6       19.3\nCash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes        5.1        5.1\nTotal restricted cash(a)                                                       $  19.7    $  24.4\n(a) Comprises $ 18.4billion and $ 22.7billion in\ndeposits with banks, and $ 1.3billion and $ 1.7billion\nin cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:\nCash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $ 47.5billion and $\n37.2billion, respectively.\nSecurities with a fair value of $ 30.0billion and $ 1.3billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to\ncustomer activity.\nIntercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its\nsubsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the\nloans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company\nor to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred\nto as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are\ngenerally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital\nguidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates\nis limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC\ngenerally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent\nCompany is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal\nsources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and\nextensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit\nor to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and\nits subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking\norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain\ncapital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s\nmanagement or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2022, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the\naggregate, approximately $ 20billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior\napproval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2022 will be supplemented by the\nbanking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.\n280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nNote 27 – Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized requirements, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC\nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under\nBasel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall\ncapital adequacy standards for large and\ninternationally active U.S. bank holding companies and\nbanks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated\nagainst the lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements. The three components of\nregulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as\nillustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and\nleverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve,\nJPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios\nfor CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier\n1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum\nrequirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take\naction. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these\ncapital requirements established by their respective\nprimary regulators .\nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to\nwhich the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nStandardized                         Advanced                    Well-capita…\ncapital ratio                    capital ratio                          ratios\nrequirements                     requirements\nBHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)              BHC(a)       IDI(c)             BHC(d)        IDI(e)\nRisk-based\ncapital\nratios\nCET1 capital             11.2  %       7.0  %             10.5  %       7.0  %                  NA       6.5  %\nTier 1                   12.7          8.5                12.0          8.5                6.0  %        8.0\ncapital\nTotal                    14.7         10.5                14.0         10.5               10.0          10.0\ncapital\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-\nrelated commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13\nfor further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following\ntable summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.\nThe Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will\nbe utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower\nnotice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card\nlines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant\ndecreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    283\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOf…\nsh…\nle…\nfi…\nin…\ngu…\nand\not…\nco…\nBy\nre…\nma…\nat\nDe…\n31,       Con…\n(in       amo…         Exp…         Exp…\nmi…       2021         aft…         aft…\nLe…       Exp…            1            3\nCo…       in 1         year         yea…         Exp…\nex…       year         thr…         thr…         aft…                                            Ca…\ncr…         or            3            5            5                       2020                 va…\nca…       less         yea…         yea…         yea…         To…           Tot…                 20…       2020\nRe…\nRe…    $  15,…      $  2,2…      $  5,7…      $  9,3…      $  32…        $  46,…                 100        148\nEs…\nAu…\nand       11,…            —            —          951         12…           11,…                   2          —\not…\nTo…\nco…\nex…       27,…         2,2…         5,7…         10,…         45…           57,…                 102        148\ncr…\nca…\nCr…       730…            —            —            —         73…           658…                   —          —\nca…\nTo…       757…         2,2…         5,7…         10,…         77…           715…                 102        148\nco…\nWh…\nOt…\nun…\nco…       101…         167…         160…         24,…         45…           415…                 2,…       2,1…\nto\nex…\ncr…\nSt…\nle…\nof\ncr…       15,…         8,2…         4,0…         1,1…         28…           30,…                 476        443\nand\not…\nfi…\ngu…\nOt…\nle…       3,8…          498           96            —         4,…           3,0…                   9         14\nof\ncr…\nTo…       120…         175…         164…         25,…         48…           449…                 2,…       2,6…\nwh…\nTo…    $  878…      $  178…      $  170…      $  35,…      $  1,…        $  1,1…              $  2,…    $  2,7…\nle…\nOt…\ngu…\nand\nco…\nSe…\nle…\nin…    $  337…      $     —      $     —      $     —      $  33…        $  250…              $    —    $     —\nag…\nand\ngu…\nDe…\nqu…       3,1…          396         12,…         39,…         55…           54,…                 475        322\nas\ngu…\nUn…\nre…\nand       101…         2,1…            —            —         10…           102…        -h         1          2\nse…\nbo…\nag…\nUn…\nre…\nand       73,…          632            —            —         74…           104…                   —         -1\nse…\nlo…\nag…\nLo…\nsa…\nand\nse…\nin…\nMo…\nre…             NA           NA           NA           NA          NA             NA              61         84\nli…\nLo…\nso…             NA           NA           NA           NA     827            889                  19         23\nwi…\nre…\nEx…\n&\ncl…\nho…       182…            —            —            —         18…           142…                   —          —\ngu…\nand\nco…\nOt…\ngu…       5,0…         2,9…          283         2,1…         10…           9,6…        -h        69         52\nand\nco…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $ 44million\nand $ 72million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 7.9billion and $ 8.5billion,\nrespectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $ 451million and $ 357million,\nrespectively, for other letters of credit.

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount\nequal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a\ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform\nunder a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and\nthe guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of\nconsideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records\nthis fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation\nis recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any\nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds\nis allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For\nthese indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time\nor when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications\nare included in the table on page 284. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2021                                              2020\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of\ncredit and                                        credit and\nDecember 31,    other                                             other                                   Other\n(in             financial                        Other letters    financial                             letters\nmillions)       guarantees                           of credit    guarantees                          of credit\nInvestment-…                     $  19,998    $          3,087                     $  22,850    $         2,263\nNoninvestme…                         8,532               1,361                         8,132                790\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  28,530    $          4,448                     $  30,982    $         3,053\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $     123    $              9                     $      80    $            14\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              353                   —                           363                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     476    $              9                     $     443    $            14\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  14,511    $            999                     $  17,238    $           498\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    285\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s\nsecurities lending program, counterparties’\nsecurities, via custodial and non-custodial\narrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of\nthis program, the Firm provides an indemnification in\nthe lending agreements which protects the lender\nagainst the failure of the borrower to return the lent\nsecurities. To minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or\nother highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan\nfrom the borrower. Collateral is marked to market\ndaily to help assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is called from the\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit the\nlending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal\ninvested. To minimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market\nvalue exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nThese contracts include written put options that\nrequire the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by\nthe option holder at a specified price by a specified\ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written\nput option contracts in order to meet client needs, or\nfor other trading purposes. The terms of written put\noptions are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives\ndeemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as “stable value\nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of\nthe difference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been met.\nStable value products are transacted in order to allow\ninvestors to realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected portfolio. These\ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to\nterminate the contract under certain conditions. The\nnotional value of derivative guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However,\nexposure to certain stable value products is\ncontractually limited to a substantially lower\npercentage of the notional amount. The fair value of\nderivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the\nFirm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to\nperform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures\nto these contracts by entering into offsetting\ntransactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge\nthe market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(in millions)                                      December 31, 2021               December 31, 2020\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  55,730                       $  54,415\nStable value contracts with                29,778                          27,752\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        2,882                           2,803\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                           475                             322\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal course\nof business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty.\nThe Firm also enters into repurchase and securities\nloaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the counterparty. Such\nagreements settle at a future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets until settlement date. These agreements\npredominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer\nto Note 11 for a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-\nrelated indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has\nmade representations and warranties that the loans\nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require\nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify\nthe loan purchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations\nis separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing\nits litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products on\nboth a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse\nservicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is\nthe cost of temporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse\nservicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk\n286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or\nguarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property\nunderlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on\nthe loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are\npredominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of\nthe mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unpaid principal balance of\nloans sold with recourse totaled $ 827million and $ 889million, respectively. The carrying value of the related\nliability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets,\nwhich is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse\nobligations, was $ 19million and $ 23million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other off-balance sheet\narrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the\nU.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a\nchange in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the\nsecurities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The\nFirm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software\nlicensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it\nindemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the\nsoftware, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of\nthe business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification\narrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a\nmerchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that\nresult in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the\ntransaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant\nServices will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this\nrisk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition,\nMerchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related\nto charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Merchant Services processed an aggregate\nvolume of $ 1,886.7billion, $ 1,597.3billion, and $ 1,511.5billion, respectively. Clearing Services – Client Credit\nRisk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative\ncontracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a\nclearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral\n(margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in\nwhole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of\nclients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the\nbasis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm\nis exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the\nCCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate\namounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing\nclearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of\nnonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP\nwould utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the\nFirm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the\nrecognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or\nderivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate\nthe Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of\ntransactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk\nmitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material\npayments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on\nthe derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    287\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and\nclearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership\nin some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization\nas a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations\nmay be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund\nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a\nmember default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata\nshare of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial\nmargin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required\nshould such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb\nthe losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible\nexposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is\ndisclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored\nmember repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf\nof clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt\nand full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-\nquality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk\nof loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to Note\n11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral\npledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent\nCompany may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the\nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet\ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees\nis remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by\nJPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company\nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, are not included in the table on page 284 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\n288    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that\nit owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at\ndiscount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various\nother central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                      2021        2020\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $  126.3    $  166.6\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged       112.0       113.9\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks        476.4       455.3\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  714.7    $  735.8\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities.

Refer to Note 20 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s long-term debt. The\nsignificant components of the Firm’s pledged assets\nwere as follows.\nDecember 31, (in billions)        2021        2020\nInvestment securities         $   80.1    $   80.2\nLoans                            428.5       420.5\nTrading assets and other         206.1       235.1\nTotal pledged assets          $  714.7    $  735.8\nCollateral The Firm accepts financial assets as\ncollateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge,\ndeliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally\nobtained under resale and other securities financing\nagreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-\ninvestment customer receivables and derivative\ncontracts. Collateral is generally used under\nrepurchase and other securities financing agreements,\nto cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative\ncontracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                        2021          2020\nCollateral permitted to be sold or          $  1,471.3    $  1,451.7\nrepledged, delivered, or otherwise used\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or       1,111.0       1,038.9\notherwise used\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    289\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 30 – Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous\nlegal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement\nmatters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with\npotentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are\nat varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business\nand several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for\nits legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which\nthe Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not\nbelieve that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the\nproceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of\nmultiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of\nmany of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,\nincluding where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be\nincorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into\naccount in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the\nFirm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Amrapali\n. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P.Morgan India Private Limited in connection with\ninvestments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential\nhousing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims\nagainst Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver\nresidential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In\nAugust 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm\nis appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making\npreliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the\noffshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act\n(“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from\nJ.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated\nan escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil\ncompanies. The account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights\nto an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the\naccount in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments\nmade out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nwas or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for\nsummary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial commenced in February 2022. Foreign\nExchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year\n290    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified\nProfessional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January\n2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-\nyeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a\nSouth Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by\nU.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX\nfutures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded\nfrom the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in\nNovember 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against\nthe Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by\nthe Firm and 11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related\nindividual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. Inquiries Concerning Preservation\nRequirements . In December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve\ntheir respective civil investigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to broker-\ndealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\ndid not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping\nrules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not\nbeen approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision failures. Under these\nresolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $ 75million civil monetary\npenalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and other material from certain\nauthorities concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business\ncommunications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is\ncooperating with these inquiries. Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a\nseries of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the\nprice of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012,\nthe parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and\nmodifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on\nappeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further\nproceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions,\none seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the\nparties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement\nagreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended\nsettlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval\norder, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the\nsettlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court\ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In addition, certain\nmerchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against\nthe Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations\nand Litigation . JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around\nthe world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)\nfor various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss\nCompetition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,\ncontinues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    291\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class\nactions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain\nother actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps\nsold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period\nthat U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of\nindividual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were\nengaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based\nconsumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In December 2021, the court\ndenied plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s settlements of putative class\nactions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and\nthe Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries\nInvestigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its\nsubsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred\nProsecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ,\nCFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total\nmonetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation\npayments. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and\noptions price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege\nunjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a\nsettlement among the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District\nCourts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging\nmanipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The\nactions in the Northern District of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions, and, in December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement\namong the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar\nalleged underlying conduct related to precious metals. In October 2020, twoputative class action complaints were\nfiled under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the\nputative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that\nthey did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated\nthese putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021, which\nadditionally alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures\ntraders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,\nInc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of\nfederal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the\nemergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. * * *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it\nintends to\n292    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\ndefend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings\nmay be initiated from time to time in the future. The\nFirm has established reserves for several hundred of\nits currently outstanding legal proceedings. In\naccordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-\nrelated liability when it is probable that such a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its\noutstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess\nits litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such\nreserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement’s best judgment after consultation with\ncounsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 426million, $\n1.1billion and $ 239million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There\nis no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves\nwill not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of\nthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of\nlegal proceedings, particularly where the claimants\nseek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories, involve a large\nnumber of parties or are in early stages of discovery,\nthe Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the\neventual outcomes of the currently pending matters,\nthe timing of their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences\nrelated to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes,\nbased upon its current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel, consideration of the\nmaterial legal proceedings described above and after\ntaking into account its current litigation reserves\nand its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings currently pending\nagainst it should not have a material adverse effect\non the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The\nFirm notes, however, that in light of the\nuncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is\nno assurance that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters will not significantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter will not have\nmaterial reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to\nJPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular\nperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of\nthe loss or liability imposed and the level of\nJPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    293\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 31 – International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major\ninternational geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation\nas business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is\nbased predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed,\nbooking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve\ninternational businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have\nbeen made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and\nassumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The\nFirm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation\nto total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for\nthe year\nended\nDecember 31,                                            Income before\n(in millions)                                              income tax\n2021                Revenue(c)       Expense(d)               expense       Net income       Total assets\nEurope/Middle    $      16,561    $      10,833    $            5,728    $       4,202    $       517,904    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific             9,654            6,372                 3,282            2,300            277,897\nLatin                    2,756            1,589                 1,167              878             61,657\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   28,971           18,794                10,177            7,380            857,458\ninternational\nNorth                   92,678           43,293                49,385           40,954          2,886,109\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     121,649    $      62,087    $           59,562    $      48,334    $     3,743,567\n2020(b)\nEurope/Middle    $      16,566    $      10,987    $            5,579    $       3,868    $       530,687    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific             9,289            5,558                 3,731            2,630            252,553\nLatin                    2,740            1,590                 1,150              837             61,980\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   28,595           18,135                10,460            7,335            845,220\ninternational\nNorth                   91,356           66,001                25,355           21,796          2,539,537\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     119,951    $      84,136    $           35,815    $      29,131    $     3,384,757\n2019(b)\nEurope/Middle    $      15,887    $       9,860    $            6,027    $       4,158    $       391,369    -e\nEast/Africa\nAsia-Pacific             7,254            5,060                 2,194            1,467            183,023\nLatin                    2,405            1,561                   844              609             47,820\nAmerica/Cari…\nTotal                   25,546           16,481                 9,065            6,234            622,212\ninternational\nNorth                   90,174           54,373                35,801           30,197          2,064,265\nAmerica(a)\nTotal            $     115,720    $      70,854    $           44,866    $      36,431    $     2,686,477\n(a) Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation .\n(c) Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.\n(d) Expense is composed of noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.\n(e) Total assets for the U.K. were approximately $ 365billion, $ 353billion and $ 309billion at December 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\n294    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\nNote 32 – Business segments\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within\nincome tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or\nby the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety\nof factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is\nmeasured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s\nperformance. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the\nGSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The assumptions and methodologies used\nto allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from\ntime to time.\nSegment results and reconciliation (a)\n…\n&\n…                            …\n…                            …\n…      …                     …      …\n…    $         …             …    $         …\n…              …             …              …\n…              …             …              …\n…              …             …              …\n…              …             …              …\n…              …             …              …\n…              …             …              …\n…    $         …             …    $         …\n…    $         …             …    $         …\n…      …              …             …              …\n…         %    …             …         %    …\n…              …             …              …\n296    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K\n…\n…                                 …                                        …\n…       …        …                …       …                …               …       …        …\n$  …     $  …     $  …            $  …     $  …       …    $  …       …    $  …     $  …    $\n…        …        …               …        …               …               …        …\n…        …        …               …        …               …               …        …\n…        …        …               —        —               —               …        …\n…        …        …               —        —               —               …        …\n…        …        …               …        …               …               …        …\n…        …        …               …        …       …       …       …       …        …\n$  …     $  …     $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —            $  …     $  …    $\n$  …     $  …     $  …            $  —     $  —            $  —            $  …     $  …    $\n…        …        …                  …        …               …            …        …\n…        …        …               …        …               …            …  %     …         %\n…        …        …               …        …               …            …        …\n(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact\nrecorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

The attribution between\nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in\nthe table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 300-304 for more information on average balances and\nrates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated\nseparately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net\nspread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result,\nchanges in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result,\nand due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended               2021 versus                                    2020 versus\nDecember 31,                    2020                                           2019\n(On a                Increase/(decr…                                 Increase/(dec…\ntaxable-equiv…         due to change                                  due to change\nbasis; in                        in:                       Net                  in:                         Net\nmillions)                     Volume         Rate       change               Volume          Rate        change\nInterest-earn…\nassets\nDeposits with\nbanks:\nU.S.              $              308    $    -383    $     -75    $             333    $   -3,153    $   -2,820\nNon-U.S.                         -42         -120         -162                   -8          -310          -318\nFederal funds\nsold and\nsecurities\npurchased\nunder resale\nagreements:\nU.S.                             -66         -976       -1,042                  -83        -2,644        -2,727\nNon-U.S.                          75         -511         -436                   81        -1,064          -983\nSecurities\nborrowed:(a)\nU.S.                             -84           70          -14                  -24        -1,704        -1,728\nNon-U.S.                         -13          -56          -69                   -1          -147          -148\nTrading assets\n– debt\ninstruments:\nU.S.                          -1,267         -259       -1,526                  365        -1,466        -1,101\nNon-U.S.                         481           32          513                  336          -555          -219\nInvestment\nsecurities:\nU.S.                           1,170       -2,474       -1,304                3,426        -3,686          -260\nNon-U.S.                         -44         -136         -180                   38          -115           -77\nLoans:\nU.S.                             600       -3,093       -2,493                  557        -7,907        -7,350\nNon-U.S.                         355          -85          270                   74          -850          -776\nAll other\ninterest-earn…\nassets,                          320         -449         -129                  324        -1,447        -1,123\npredominantly\nU.S.\nChange in\ninterest                       1,793       -8,440       -6,647                5,418       -25,048       -19,630\nincome\nInterest-bear…\nliabilities\nInterest-bear…\ndeposits:\nU.S.                             109       -1,496       -1,387                  495        -5,103        -4,608\nNon-U.S.                         -55         -384         -439                   25        -2,017        -1,992\nFederal funds\npurchased and\nsecurities\nloaned or sold\nunder\nrepurchase\nagreements:\nU.S.                              -6         -635         -641                  176        -3,302        -3,126\nNon-U.S.                           8         -151         -143                  -51          -395          -446\nTrading\nliabilities –\ndebt,\nshort-term\nand all other\ninterest-bear…\nliabilities:\n(a)(b)\nU.S.                             -43         -272         -315                    2        -2,606        -2,604\nNon-U.S.                         112           19          131                   36          -698          -662\nBeneficial\ninterests\nissued by\nconsolidated                     -27         -104         -131                  -37          -317          -354\nVIEs,\npredominantly\nU.S.\nLong-term\ndebt:\nU.S.                             -64       -1,411       -1,475                  131        -3,193        -3,062\nNon-U.S.                         -12            5           -7                    6            13            19\nIntercompany\nfunding:\nU.S.                            -739          764           25                  -89           249           160\nNon-U.S.                         739         -764          -25                   89          -249          -160\nChange in\ninterest                          22       -4,429       -4,407                  783       -17,618       -16,835\nexpense\nChange in net\ninterest          $            1,771    $  -4,011    $  -2,240    $           4,635    $   -7,430    $   -2,795\nincome\n(a) Negative interest income and yield are related to the impact of current interest rates combined with the fees\npaid on client-driven securities borrowed balances.

The\ncurrent estimated LTV ratios are calculated using\nestimated collateral values derived from a nationally\nrecognized home price index measured at the\nmetropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to\nthe extent available and forecasted data where actual\ndata is not available. As a result, the estimated\ncollateral values used to calculate these ratios do\nnot represent actual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are\nnecessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed\nas estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien\npositions, as well as unused lines, related to the\nproperty.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio\nabove normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan.

          "content": "Part I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well\nas the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a\nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding\ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject\nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The\nFederal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the\nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan\nChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by\nadditional authorities based on the activities or\nlicenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and,\nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and regulated by the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated\nby the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the\n“PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\n(“FCA”).\nThe Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated\nby the banking, securities, prudential and conduct\nregulatory authorities in the countries in which they\noperate.\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business\nactivities other than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in\na broader range of financial activities. The Federal\nReserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to\nconduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or\nany of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases\nto meet applicable eligibility requirements. The\nFederal Reserve may also impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture\nof the FHC’s depository institutions. If any\ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails to\nmaintain a satisfactory rating under the Community\nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit\nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new\nactivities other than those permissible for BHCs, or\nacquiring a company engaged in such activities.\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the\ninternational Basel III capital and liquidity\nframework and evaluates the Firm’s compliance with\nthose requirements. The OCC establishes similar\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of\nthe Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also\nsubject to local capital and liquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In January 2019, the Basel Committee\nissued “Minimum capital requirements for market risk.”\nThe Basel Committee expects national regulators to\nimplement these revised market risk requirements for\nbanking organizations in their jurisdictions by\nJanuary 2023, in line with the other elements of the\nBasel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators have\nannounced their support for the issuance of the Basel\nIII Reforms and are considering how to appropriately\napply such reforms in the U.S.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 .\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an\nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking\ninto account the results of separate stress tests\ndesigned by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The\nFederal Reserve uses the results under the severely\nadverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to\ndetermine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)\nrequirement for the coming year, which forms part of\nthe Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is\nrequired to file its annual CCAR submission on April\n5, 2022. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of\nits indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2022 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2022. The Firm’s\nfinal SCB requirement will become effective on October\n1, 2022. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to\nperform separate, similar stress tests annually. The\nFirm publishes each year the results of the annual\nstress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse”\nscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nmore information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate\nto identify and monitor risks to the financial\nstability of the U.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and\nreporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial institutions\n(“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve\nhas adopted several rules to implement those\nheightened prudential standards, including rules\nrelating to risk management and corporate governance\nof subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under\nthese rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and\noverall risk\n4\nmanagement standards, including oversight by the board\nof directors of risk management activities.\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nmaintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated\nannually, summarizing the actions it would take to\navoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-\nfunded in the case of an adverse event. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and\nsubmit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The\nFirm is required to submit periodically to the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in the\nevent of material distress or failure (a “resolution\nplan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised\nthe regulations governing resolution plan\nrequirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the\nFirm’s resolution plan submissions will alternate\nbetween “targeted” and “full” plans. The Firm’s\n“targeted” resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare\nand submit a separate resolution plan as directed by\nthe FDIC.\nCertain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and\nbranches are also subject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its\nsubsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution\nunder an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S.\nTreasury Secretary, in consultation with the President\nof the United States, must first make certain\ndeterminations concerning extraordinary financial\ndistress and systemic risk, and action must be\nrecommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.\nAbsent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain\nsubject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The\nFDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing\nits “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of\nSIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which\nseeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and\nimpose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC\nin receivership according to their statutory order of\npriority.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the\nFederal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and\ntheir banks are subject to requirements, limitations\nand prohibitions established by law and by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are\nrequired to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares\nof an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by\nfinancial companies are prohibited if, as a result of\nthe acquisition, the total liabilities of the\nfinancial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore,\nfor certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide\nwritten notice to the Federal Reserve prior to\nacquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of\nany\nvoting shares of any company with over $10 billion in\nassets that is engaged in activities that are\n“financial in nature.”\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to\nobligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution\nAgreement entered into with the Department of Justice\non September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and\nU.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as\nunder a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those\nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could include limiting\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities, or imposing\ncorrective capital or managerial requirements on the\nbank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad\npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the\napproval of the institution’s creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to a depository\ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the\nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the\nundercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In\ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration\nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established\nguidelines setting forth heightened standards for\nlarge banks, including minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s\nrisk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s\nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from\nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.\nThe bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for\napproving the bank’s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking\nactivities, and holding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance framework.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of\ncredit to,\n5",

These restrictions prevent JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from\nsuch subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in\nspecified amounts and comply with certain other\nrequirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations\non the payment of dividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the\namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\ncould pay, at January 1, 2022, to JPMorgan Chase\nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The\nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank\nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of\nthe financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of\na receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and\nthe claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities\n(including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches\nthat are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S.\nbranch) have priority over the claims of other\nunsecured creditors of the institution, including\ndepositors in non-U.S. branches and public\nnoteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal\nconsumer protection laws, including laws relating to\nfair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices in connection with the\noffer, sale or provision of consumer financial\nproducts and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction\nover small business lending activities with respect to\nfair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As\npart of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions against firms\nthat offer certain products and services to consumers\nusing practices that are deemed to be unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive. The Firm’s consumer activities\nare also subject to regulation under state statutes\nwhich are enforced by the Attorney General or\nempowered agency of each state.\nIn September 2021, the Firm launched a retail bank in\nthe U.K. operating through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited\n(“JPMEL”) and acquired Nutmeg Saving and Investment\nLimited, a U.K. online digital investment manager\n(“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both\nJPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect\nto their conduct of financial services in the U.K.,\nincluding obligations relating to the fair treatment\nof customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K.\nPayment Systems Regulator with respect to its\noperation and use of payment systems. In addition, the\nretail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to\nU.K. consumer-protection legislation.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and\nbrokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations\nof the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange,\namong others. The Firm conducts similar securities\nactivities outside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities\nare conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-\ndealers are subject to laws and regulations covering\nall aspects of the securities business, including\nsales and trading practices, securities offerings,\npublication of research reports, use of customer\nfunds, the financing of client purchases, capital\nstructure, record-keeping and retention, and the\nconduct of their directors, officers and employees.\nRefer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96\nfor information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are\nsubject to significant regulation in jurisdictions\naround the world relating to, among other things, the\nsafeguarding and management of client assets,\nofferings of funds and marketing activities.

Morgan Securities LLC\nand J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the\nCFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC registered\nwith the SEC as “security-based swap dealers”\neffective November 2021. As a result, these entities\nare subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework\napplicable to their swap or security-based swap\nactivities, including capital requirements, rules\nrequiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and\nsecurity-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of\ncounterparty collateral, business conduct and\ndocumentation standards, record-keeping and reporting\nobligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation\nrequirements.

Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the\nCFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member\nof the National Futures Association.\nData, privacy and security regulation:\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous\nU.S. federal, state and local as well as international\nlaws, rules and regulations concerning data that are\ncentral to the Firm’s businesses, functions and\noperations. These include laws, rules and regulations\nrelating to data protection, privacy, data use,\nconfidentiality, secrecy, cybersecurity, technology,\nartificial intelligence, data localization and\nstorage, data retention and destruction, disclosure,\ntransfer, availability, integrity and other similar\nmatters. Numerous jurisdictions have passed laws,\nrules and regulations in these areas and many are\nconsidering new or updated ones that could affect the\nFirm’s businesses. Many of these laws apply not only\nto the Firm’s transactions with third parties but also\nto interactions between and among the Firm’s own\naffiliates and subsidiaries. The application,\ninterpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in\nlight of new and rapidly evolving data-driven\ntechnologies and significant increase in computing\npower. These laws, rules and regulations are\nconstantly evolving, remain a focus of regulators\nglobally, may be enforced by private parties or\ngovernment bodies, and will continue to have a\nsignificant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and\noperations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal\ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.

The\nFederal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the\nFDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that\nincentive compensation paid by banking organizations\ndoes not encourage imprudent risk-taking that\nthreatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The\nFinancial Stability Board (“FSB”) has also established\nstandards covering compensation principles for banks.\nThe Firm’s compensation practices are also subject to\nregulation and oversight by regulators in other\njurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements\nDirective (“CRD V”), as implemented in the EU and as\nadopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-\nrelated provisions. The European Banking Authority has\ninstituted guidelines on compensation policies\nincluding under CRD V which in certain countries, such\nas Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local\nregulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have\nalso instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation\npolicies. The Firm expects that the implementation of\nregulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the\nU.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and\nmay affect the manner in which the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\nOther significant international regulatory\ninitiatives:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement\nan extensive program of regulatory enhancements\nrelating to financial services, several key elements\nof which are discussed below.\nU.K. and EU policymakers have recently proposed\nchanges to the Markets in Financial Instruments\nDirective (“MiFID II”). MiFID II, which requires the\ntrading of shares and certain standardized OTC\nderivatives to take place on trading venues and also\nsignificantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-\ntrade transparency, transaction reporting and investor\nprotection, and introduced a position limits and\nreporting regime for commodities. In November 2021,\nthe European Commission published a draft legislative\nproposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes\nto the transparency and market structure rules,\nincluding the proposed creation of a consolidated tape\nintended to provide investors with a holistic view of\ntrading across the EU. This legislation is subject to\nreview by the European Parliament and Council.\nIn the U.K., Her Majesty’s Treasury (“HMT”) and the\nFCA have undertaken a review of MiFID II, as adopted\nin the U.K. In July 2021, HMT published its ‘Wholesale\nMarkets Review’ consultation, which proposed a broad\nrange of changes covering most parts of the MiFID II\nlegislation. HMT is expected to release its related\npolicy statement in the first quarter of 2022.\nDetailed consultations with specific rule proposals\nrelating to the HMT policy statement are expected from\nthe FCA during 2022.\nIn November 2021, EU legislators agreed to delay\nimplementation of the mandatory buy-in rules required\nunder the Central Securities Depositories Regulation\n(“CSDR”), which were previously scheduled to become\neffective on February 1, 2022.

The\nCOVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the\npandemic, which included the institution of social\ndistancing and shelter-in-place requirements in\ncertain areas of the U.S. and other countries,\nresulted in adverse impacts on global economic\nconditions, including:\nsignificant disruption and volatility in the\nfinancial markets\nsignificant disruption of global supply chains, and\nclosures of many businesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and increased unemployment.\nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic\nhave had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses and results of operations,\nincluding:\nreduction in demand for certain products and\nservices from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers,\nresulting in lower revenue, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses during\nthe early stages of the pandemic.\nAlthough global economic conditions have been\nimproving despite the continuation of the COVID-19\npandemic, any ongoing negative economic impacts\narising from the pandemic or any prolongation or\nworsening of the pandemic, including as a result of\nadditional waves or variants of the COVID-19 disease\nor the emergence of other diseases that have similar\noutcomes, could have significant adverse effects on\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition, including:\nrecognition of charge-offs and increases in the\nallowance for credit losses, including any delayed\nrecognition of charge-offs due to the impact of\ngovernment stimulus actions or payment assistance\nprovided to clients and customers\nmaterial impacts on the value of securities,\nderivatives and other financial instruments which\nJPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets\ndowngrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings\nconstraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated\nlevels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets\n(“RWA”) related to supporting client activities,\ndowngrades in client credit ratings, regulatory\nactions or other factors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking\nactions that it otherwise would under its liquidity\nand capital management strategies, and\nthe possibility that significant portions of\nJPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work\neffectively, including because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government\nactions or other restrictions in connection with the\npandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively\naffects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as its\nregulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend\non future developments that are uncertain and cannot\nbe fully predicted, including:\nthe ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic\nthe effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, and\ntheir availability in certain regions\nactions taken by governmental authorities and other\nthird parties in response to the pandemic, and\nthe effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or\nworsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of\neconomic growth, inflation, the strength of labor\nmarkets, particularly in light of the expiration of\ngovernment assistance programs, and the potential for\nchanges in consumer\n10\nbehavior that could have longer-term impacts on\ncertain economic sectors.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation in U.S.\ngovernment programs designed to support individuals,\nhouseholds and businesses impacted by the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether\ndirectly or indirectly, including on behalf of\ncustomers and clients or by affiliated entities,\nnewly-acquired businesses or companies in which\nJPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, could\nbe criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:\nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\nnegative publicity, and\nincreased exposure to litigation,\nany or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational, legal and compliance costs and damage its\nreputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic\nadversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks\ndescribed below.\nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and\nthe laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan\nChase have a significant impact on its business and\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with\noperations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with\nthe laws, rules and regulations that apply to its\noperations in all of the jurisdictions around the\nworld in which it does business. Regulation of the\nfinancial services industry is extensive.\nThe regulation and supervision of financial services\nfirms has expanded significantly over an extended\nperiod of time. The increased regulation and\nsupervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way\nthat it conducts its business and structures its\noperations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make\nfurther changes to its business and operations in\nresponse to expanded supervision or to new or changed\nlaws, rules and regulations. These types of\ndevelopments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring\nadditional costs in connection with complying with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations, which could\nreduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan\nChase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or\nan increase in its principal investments may require\nJPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules,\nand regulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase\nhas in the past been and could in the future be,\nrequired to:\nlimit the products and services that it offers\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its\nmarket-making activities\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that\nit might otherwise pursue\npay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other\ngovernmental charges, including in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\nincur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions\nperpetrated against its customers\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities,\nor\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and\nservices, which could reduce the demand for them.\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results\nof operations could be adversely impacted by changes\nin laws, rules and regulations, or changes in the\napplication, interpretation or enforcement of laws,\nrules and regulations, that:\nproscribe or institute more stringent restrictions\non certain financial services activities\nimpose new requirements relating to the impact of\nbusiness activities on environmental, social and\ngovernance (“ESG”) concerns, the management of risks\nassociated with those concerns and the offering of\nproducts intended to achieve ESG-related objectives,\nor\nintroduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition\nlaws, rules and regulations that adversely affect the\nbusiness activities of JPMorgan Chase.\nDifferences in financial services regulation can be\ndisadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as the size\nof the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized\nor operates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision and regulation\nfinancial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation, or may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not have the same\nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies which supervise more diversified financial\nservices firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a\nparticular jurisdiction may favor financial\ninstitutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework\ncan result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to\ncompetitors that are less regulated or not subject to\nregulation, especially with respect to unregulated\nfinancial products.\n11",

          "content": "Part I\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways\nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are implemented in the\nU.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to implement a global\nregulatory standard, a national regulator may\nintroduce additional or more restrictive requirements,\nwhich can create competitive disadvantages for\nfinancial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that\nmay be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant\nmodifications to its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant countries or regions in\norder to comply with those requirements. These include\nlaws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or\nproposed relating to:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital\nor liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nthe separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking\nproducts and services from markets activities\nthe resolution of financial institutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions\non exchanges or through central counterparties\n(“CCPs”)\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorgan\nChase to:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nabsorb increased operational, capital and liquidity\ncosts\nchange the prices that it charges for its products\nand services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to\nits customers and clients\ncurtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses, results of operations and\nprofitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral\nconsequences, and could result in higher compliance\ncosts or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened\noversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in\nmany jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid\nsignificant fines, provided other monetary relief,\nincurred other penalties and experienced other\nrepercussions in connection with resolving\ninvestigations and enforcement actions by governmental\nagencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to\nsimilar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements of any such\nresolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and compliance costs,\nincluding devoting substantial resources to the\nrequired remediation, or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have\ndemonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions\nagainst financial institutions and have required that\ninstitutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or\nadmit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nResolutions of this type can have significant\ncollateral consequences for the subject financial\ninstitution, including:\nloss of clients, customers and business\nrestrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\nit and other financial services firms will continue\nto be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions\nregulators will continue to require that financial\ninstitutions be penalized for actual or deemed\nviolations of law with formal and punitive enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of significant\nmonetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving\nthese matters through informal supervisory actions;\nand\n12\nregulators will be more likely to pursue formal\nenforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan\nChase to the extent that it has previously been\nsubject to other governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions.\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of\nany resolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and\nexpectations of its regulators, it could be required\nto, among other things:\nenter into further resolutions of investigations or\nenforcement actions\npay additional regulatory penalties or enter into\njudgments, or\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution\nor civil litigation with respect to the conduct that\ngave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nJPMorgan Chase can face greater risks of non-\ncompliance and incur higher operational and compliance\ncosts under laws, rules and regulations relating to\nanti-money laundering, economic sanctions, embargo\nprograms and anti-corruption.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with laws, rules and\nregulations throughout the world relating to anti-\nmoney laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs\nand anti-corruption which can increase its risks of\nnon-compliance and costs associated with the\nimplementation and maintenance of complex compliance\nprograms. A violation of any of these legal and\nregulatory requirements could subject JPMorgan Chase,\nor individual employees, to regulatory enforcement\nactions as well as significant civil and criminal\npenalties. In addition, certain national and multi-\nnational bodies and governmental agencies outside the\nU.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that\nconflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan\nChase from complying with laws, rules and regulations\nto which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of\nlaw issues that also increase its risks of non-\ncompliance in those jurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can\nbe negatively impacted in countries with less\npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in\ncertain countries in which the application of the rule\nof law is inconsistent or less predictable, including\nwith respect to:\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business or\ntransactions\nconflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and\nregulations, or the inconsistent application or\ninterpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of\ncontractual, intellectual property or other\nobligations\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive, and\nthe threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations,\ncivil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the\ntermination of licenses required to operate in the\nlocal market or the suspension of business\nrelationships with governmental bodies.\nIf the application of the laws, rules and regulations\nin a particular country is susceptible to producing\ninconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a\nmore difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts its business and could negatively affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings\nwith respect to that country. For example, conducting\nbusiness could require JPMorgan Chase to devote\nsignificant additional resources to understanding, and\nmonitoring changes in, local laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as structuring its operations to\ncomply with local laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementing and administering related internal\npolicies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in compliance\nwith the laws, rules and regulations of all of the\njurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of\nnon-compliance can be greater in countries that have\nless predictable legal and regulatory systems.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or curtail\nits businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those\nagencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly\nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the\nrequirements for resolution plans may be modified from\ntime to time. Any such determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes\nto its legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to\nserve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements\nor restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities\nor operations. The agencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest\nassets or businesses in\n13",

(the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible\nLTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s\noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to\nenter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will absorb the\nlosses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that\nonly the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue\nnormal operations or subsequently be divested or wound\ndown in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent\nCompany’s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on\nits unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of\nthose securities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries\nand to the claims of priority (as determined by\nstatute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in\nbankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would realize value\nonly to the extent available to the Parent Company as\na shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nother subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point\nof entry recapitalization model could be a desirable\nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title\nII. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a\nsingle point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into,\na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan\nChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the\nParent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately\nfollowed, could be greater than they might have been\nunder JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical developments can negatively impact JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries\ncan cause uncertainty in the economic environment and\nmarket conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its\nbusinesses. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy\ninitiatives and proposals could significantly affect\nU.S. and global economic growth and cause higher\nvolatility in the financial markets, including:\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal\nReserve and other central banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained large-scale asset\npurchases or any suspension or

In addition, sustained low growth, low or\nnegative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand\nfor the products and services offered by JPMorgan\nChase’s consumer businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which\ncan reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These\nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain\ngeographies and industry segments where declining\nindustrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in\nor could result in higher levels of unemployment, or\nwhere high levels of consumer debt, such as\noutstanding student loans, could impair the ability of\ncustomers to pay their other consumer loan\nobligations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses\ncould also be adversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment status\nand housing, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as\nhigher taxes and increased regulation which could\nresult in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nIn addition, governmental proposals to permit student\nloan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy\nproceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare\npersonal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and\ncharge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans\nextended to those customers.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale\nbusinesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for\nwhich it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions.\nThese factors can also influence the willingness of\nother financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that\nJPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwritings. Furthermore, if a\nsignificant and sustained deterioration in market\nconditions were to occur, the profitability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including\nits loan syndication, securities underwriting and\nleveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the\nextent that those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations\nin unfavorable market conditions, or\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss,\nor hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular\nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe\ndownturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that affect specific economic sectors, could\nhave a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan\nChase whose operations or financial condition are\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on the health or\nstability of those market segments or economic\nsectors, as well as clients that are engaged in\nrelated businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses\non its loans and other credit commitments to clients\nthat operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of\nthe economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuations of\nclient assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds\nunder custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan\nChase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount\nof assets under management or custody. Similarly,\nadverse macroeconomic or market conditions could\nprompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts,\nor cause clients to invest in products that generate\nlower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the\ninvestment performance of the fund, particularly if\nthe outflows create the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer\nbehavior that results in shifts in consumer and\nbusiness spending could also have a negative impact on\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and\nthereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its\nwholesale operations. For example, the businesses of\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are\ndependent on consistent streams of rental income from\ncommercial real estate properties which are owned or\nbeing built by those clients. Sustained adverse\neconomic conditions could result in reductions in the\nrental cash flows that owners or developers receive\nfrom their tenants which, in turn, could depress the\nvalues of the properties and impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their commercial\nreal estate loans. These consequences could result in\nJPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance\nfor credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and\ncharge-offs within its commercial real estate loan\nportfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a\nlarger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its\nwholesale businesses.\n16\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue\nand income streams related to its traditional banking\nand funding activities.\nIn general, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could\nreduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its\ninvestment securities portfolio to the extent that it\nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy\nJPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that\nit accepts from customers and clients, which could\nresult in lower revenues, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s\nmortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby\ndecreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive\nfor JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit\nspreads may widen or narrow not only in response to\nevents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan\nChase but also as a result of general economic and\ngeopolitical events and conditions. Changes in\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect,\npositively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on\ncertain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are\nrecorded at fair value.\nWhen interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can\ngenerally be expected to earn higher net interest\nincome. However, higher interest rates can also lead\nto:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures\nthe loss of deposits, including in the event that\nJPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about\ndepositor behavior\nunrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-\nsale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment\nsecurities portfolio\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce\ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of\nshort-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels.\nHigher interest rates can also negatively affect the\npayment\nperformance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer\nand wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to\nvariable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate\nloans are unable to afford higher interest payments,\nthose borrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\nJPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the\nvalue of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets can be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and other disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may make it extremely difficult to\nvalue certain financial instruments. Subsequent\nvaluations of financial instruments in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, at the time of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of\nthese factors could cause a decline in the value of\nfinancial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets, which may have an adverse\neffect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure\nto more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan\nChase’s hedging and other risk management strategies\nmay not be effective, and it could incur significant\nlosses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,\nsecurities exchanges and government entities within\nand outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose\nJPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and\ncounterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses\nor liability where a financial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services for client\nassets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud\nor the failure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure\nof, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes\ncontracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby\n17",
